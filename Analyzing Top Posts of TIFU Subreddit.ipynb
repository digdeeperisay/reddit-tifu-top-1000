       "'Earlier this year, AncestryDNA had a sale on their kit. I thought it would be a great gift idea so I bought 6 of them for Christmas presents. Today my family got together to exchange presents for our Christmas Eve tradition, and I gave my mom, dad, brother, and 2 sisters each a kit. \\n\\nAs soon as everyone opened their gift at the same time, my mom started freaking out. She told us how she didn’t want us taking them because they had unsafe chemicals. We explained to her how there were actually no chemicals, but we could tell she was still flustered. Later she started trying to convince us that only one of us kids need to take it since we will all have the same results and to resell extra kits to save money. \\n\\nFast forward: Our parents have been fighting upstairs for the past hour, and we are downstairs trying to figure out who has a different dad. \\n\\nTL;DR I bought everyone in my family AncestryDNA kit for Christmas. My mom started freaking. Now our parents are fighting and my dad might not be my dad. \\n\\nUpdate:  Thank you so much for all the love and support. My sisters, brother and I have not yet decided yet if we are going to take the test. No matter what the results are, we will still love each other, and our parents no matter what. \\n\\nUpdate 2: CHRISTMAS ISN’T RUINED! My FU actually turned into a Christmas miracle. Turns out my sisters father passed away shortly after she was born. A good friend of my moms was able to help her through the darkest time in her life, and they went on to fall in love and create the rest of our family. They never told us because of how hard it was for my mom. Last night she was strong enough to share stories and photos with us for the first time, and it truly brought us even closer together as a family. This is a Christmas we will never forget. And yes, we are all excited to get our test results. Merry Christmas everyone!\\n\\nP.S. Sorry my mom isn’t a whore. No you’re not my daddy.  The overhead fan in our bedroom uses one of those compact halogen light bulbs. \\n\\n6 years ago the bulb burned out and got really dim, just barely a glow. I bought a replacement bulb but when I put that one in it was also barely lighting up so I realized the unit was bad.  \\n\\nThe fan still worked GREAT, it literally is the best fan I’ve ever had because it moves a ton of air and is super quiet. The fan had also been a gift when we moved into our house, the unit cost over $400 so I didn’t really want to replace it even though our bedroom doesn’t get much natural light so it is pretty dark. \\n\\n\\nSo since then over the years my wife and I have had to make due with no overhead light. We open the windows during the day, and at night use a combination of bedside lamps and the bathroom light. It’s never really as good of lighting as an overhead lamp so I keep some flashlights up there for when we are cleaning or looking for something etc. \\n\\nAfter 6 years of living in the dark, this winter I just decided I would replace the damn thing. But before I did, I decided to try one last time with another bulb because, however unlikely, it’s possible BOTH bulbs I had tried were bad. \\n\\nSo I’m up there installing the new bulb, grab the remote (the fan has a remote) and as I’m turning the light on I realize:\\n\\nThe goddamn thing is dimmable. \\n\\n\\nFor 6 fucking years we lived with the inconvenience of no overhead light and the whole time it was just because the damn thing was set to “dim”. \\n\\nFuck me. \\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\nFor 6 years I lived with no bedroom light because the overhead lamp was broken, but turns out it it was fine and it was just set to a dim setting the whole time.  Today was the day I realised I messed up by not realising sooner and just thinking my content was shit \\n\\nFor the last 12 months I\\'ve been commenting on peoples posts, I\\'ve created my own posts. I haven\\'t had a single upvote or reply to anything.. my karma has been at 885 for as long as I can remember so I just figured I wasnt very interesting (still likely true!)\\n\\nLast month I started to try and see my own posts through guest accounts and figured out they weren\\'t showing, I could still clearly see my comments and posts on my account. \\n\\nAnyway, I finally mailed the help team and found out my IP was accidentally mixed in with some action to take out spammers, if you can see this it\\'s all sorted now (and if you cant, I\\'m still in my own little Truman show)\\n\\nIf you\\'re procrastinating (and let\\'s face it, you are) feel free to go through my post history and verify the lack of any human engagement..\\n\\nTL;DR I was muted one year ago and didn\\'t notice. Since then I\\'ve spent the whole time thinking how boring I must be because nobody replies  or updoots me.. :-/\\n\\nEdit: So I\\'ve gone from castaway to a full room of people handing me little arrows! Wilson and I thank you xx\\n\\nEdit 2: this is crazy! Thanks to everyone for all the jewels and things I know nothing about. I\\'ll figure it out and pay it forwards! Special thanks to those that are answering my unanswered questions from previous posts - MVPs!\\n\\nPlease dont be too sad about this, i find it kind of funny that I\\'ve been such an idiot for so long. It\\'s ok to laugh with/at me :)\\n\\nEdit 3: Reddit is awesome. I\\'ve missed you guys! Dont feel mad at the mods, its a tough and thankless job and flooders/bots are a real PITA. Its just one of those things and I thank them for putting in the hours.\\n\\nI also want to use this very brief soap box to raise awareness for mental health. Most of us here use Reddit as an escape, some people here have fewer friends irl than they do on the net. Make sure each other are ok every once in a while (if someone goes missing, like for more than a month....) - if you see someone struggling send them a message of support, even a stranger can help.\\n\\nI love all of you weirdos <3\\n\\nEdit 4: No more I promise. I\\'m completely overwhelmed by the response and the nice feedback. I\\'m trying to answer all of the questions but its difficult to keep up. I created an /AMA when this thread went down, if you relate to any of the topics close to me like diabetes, gaming, mental health, parenting etc then keep in touch. Heres a shameless pic of me with the best doggo in the world (and authentication for mods) - he listens to me even when you guys dont ;-) https://imgur.com/EgCbe6W\\n\\nStop giving me gold! I appreciate it but give to charity instead! Heres something different we could do <3\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Charity/comments/bbok3m/redditors_lets_do_something_different_for_charity/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x Sigh. \\n\\nWork was rough today and all I wanted to do afterward was to sit on the couch and let the TV watch me while eating food not cooked by my own hands. The answer to that? Delivery. \\n\\nFood ordered, I let the dog into the yard to burn some energy and sat camped outside with him while waiting for the delivery. Doordash, Grubhub, Uber and everyone other than Jehovah\\'s Witnesses has trouble locating my address strictly relying on GPS so it\\'s nothing for me to post up and wait outside for when they are close, flag them down and go back inside for a contactless drop-off. \\n\\nPertinent details before shit hits the fan; my neighbor and I share a fence with a doggy door as our pups are super close and you can bet each time that if my dog is outside, hers will follow for cross-yard playtime. This was the case today and probably bad judgement on my part to think that I would be able to break up the fun quickly. \\n\\nBoth dogs were in the neighbor’s yard at the time the notification came through that the driver was pulling up and I had to call out a few times to get my dog’s attention. Neighbor thankfully whistled for her dog and I had to put on the ”voice” for mine to acknowledge I existed and then took off running for my door while waving to the driver who by this point was getting out of the car. \\n\\nPup and I have a game called Runaway where I will take off yelling ”RUNAWAY” and literally he will chase after me like some human sized fetch-stick. I use this to my advantage until he realized I was putting him inside but managed to get him through the storm door and close the screen before he could run out. Then realized that I\\'d left the gate locked like an idiot with the driver standing right outside by this point. \\n\\nI didn\\'t have a mask on at this point and neither did she so I yelled from the porch that she could leave the food by the mailbox and that is where the fun started. \\n\\n”Is that your dog?”\\n\\nMy bullshit meter didn\\'t go off. I thought she was asking a question with an obvious answer because duh, she was a dog person so I engaged with dog-owner gushiness. Yes; blah, blah, blah... His name is XYZ... Wanna say hi? \\n\\nI’ll be nice because you brought my food. \\n\\nBut she just stood there awkwardly for a moment, put the food down and quickly jumped back into her car. In my mind I was like, ”okay weird” but whatever. Snatched the food and went back inside. Went to wash my hands and from the kitchen window, I can see the full street where she is still parked outside. Thinking “okay weird...” again but didn’t dwell on it too much figuring that she was looking at the route to her next location. \\n\\nI went about my business of preparing to destroy my meal. Few minutes later, the dog begins barking manically at the door. I take a glance at the cameras and realize she is still out front parked directly in front of my mailbox. \\n\\nUh...ok? What’s going on here?\\n\\nI go outside and try to get her attention but she is on the phone and doesn’t notice me. I walk up like I’m going to check the mail and she does pull off, but towards the back of the neighborhood that only has one way in and one way out. Lots of people make that mistake and so you’ll quickly see cars turning back around but she never came back. By this time, I think I’m losing my mind so I go back in but still watching the street for the car to pass. It never does. \\n\\nI don’t know, people are weird so I just left it at that and went back to eat. About ten minutes later, dog starts going ham at the door so I check the cameras to see two police cars sitting outside my house. \\n\\nI continue to watch the cameras realizing that yup, the cops are getting out of the car and walking back and forth in front of mine and neighbor’s yards. I go out to see if anything is wrong and they introduce themselves before saying they were called because a stolen Golden Retriever was reported at my address and if there was a dog in the home. \\n\\nIt clicked that Driver had called the police and then explained my version of what happened. They were really respectful and apologetic but asked if I could get Sir Pup. I went ahead and opened the door for the dog who took off, ready to greet the new faces outside. His collar has tags matching the address with my name and phone number on it in case he was ever lost or stolen which was proof enough for them as it was obvious that they wanted to get this over as fast as possible. \\n\\nNo hard feelings on either side, we were all walking away when Driver’s car slowly comes creeping from the back of the neighborhood. I yelled out to them that the lady was right there and they positioned themselves in front of her car in a way she would have to stop and speak with them. \\n\\nI don’t know if this lady was drunk or off her meds but she rolled down the window and was literally sobbing hysterically that she saw me take the dog from the neighbor’s yard, that animals get no justice and the icing on the cake? MY KIND only owns Pittbulls and Rottweilers. There was no way he was mine and needed to be protected. I honestly did not want to deal with that mess so sorry guys, this isn’t a tale of revenge; I went back inside and stayed the fuck on my couch. My day was already shitty. Everyone left a few minutes after that so I assume she got a warning. \\n\\nHowever, I did report the incident to the delivery service and was offered credits towards my next meal. \\n\\nI splurged that on a bakery and now am currently fucking up a slice of carrot cake, grateful it didn’t end worse. \\n\\nTL; DR\\n\\nOrdered food, racist delivery person thought I stole my own Golden Retriever and had a breakdown when I didn’t get carted off in handcuffs. Didn’t get shot but got cake in the end.\\n\\nEdit: Wow, Reddit! Waking up to the massive amounts of love and well wishes was amazing! Thank you so much for your kind words! I am going to do my best and go through every comment and private message. I wish I could share this cake with all of you! Carrot cake lovers unite! Happy to share this pile of awards with other great posts and comments!\\n\\nTaking the sound advice to keep a close eye on the dog when he goes out. Will also share with neighbor just in case! My husband did agree with many of you to seek further action against the delivery driver but I’m pretty torn on whether to do so. Things are hard out here for all of us including the less savory members of our community but I will take the day to think on the next steps.\\n\\nI appreciate the sub this was posting to for restoring it after being removed. I apologize that this topic bent the rules and didn’t think 100% before submitting. This was a way to vent. Thank you for allowing this to be a place of dialogue!\\n\\nStay classy, everyone! This is his now ex-wife.\\n\\nDid he not realize, or too dumb to remember we share everything, including the same Reddit app? I logged on to see this throwaway as the default login account.\\n\\nI’ve removed all of this personal story for my family’s protection and changed this account’s password. Although it might be too late and already circulated online.\\n\\nI took a look through the comments and was seriously disgusted by most of the responses suggesting to sexually approach both of us last night. Which my sister did mention he tried something in the middle of the night, this guy is incredibly living in another world!\\n\\nI’m only posting this to reassure everyone thinking he got away with it, that these types of scumbags DO NOT.\\n\\nI came home yesterday with my sister to pack my shit. I saw his update saying I seemed alright, but I was keeping it in for the next morning.\\n\\nReason we slept in the living-room is because I didn’t want him to see my bags in the corner of the bedroom, he came home suddenly before I finished packing. It wasn’t “fun camping” or a “picnic”.\\n\\nThis morning, before he woke-up, we grabbed the rest of my stuff and left.\\n\\nI went to the bank and froze our joint account before he irresponsibly starts taking cash out.\\n\\nI’m not seeing him anymore, going to lawyer up, give away all this Reddit gold to the comments that I feel were actually reasonable, and divorce his ass.\\n\\nOh, and if you can read this, I’ve deleted the tracking app ;) my lawyer will call you to unfreeze your share and take the steps to unlink me from any other tracking apps you might have on me.\\n\\nTL;DR: His life is ruined. I found out here on Reddit that my username that I’ve used 15+ years all over the internet was connected to Nazis because of the 1488. They banned me on r/AskReddit for it.\\n\\nI posted about it on here and changed my name to r/NazisStoleMyBirthday\\n\\nr/AskReddit unbanned me.\\n\\nThis post blew up and got really popular. It got me a 3 day suspension from Reddit for circumventing my ban on r/AskReddit\\n\\nThis morning I found out that somehow this post got changed to contain a ton of really inappropriate racial and homophobic slurs along with threats of violence. This was not me. I have no idea how that happened.\\n\\nSome of you won’t believe this and I understand that. I would be skeptical myself if I were you. For what it’s worth, I would never say things that, much less think them. My intention was to simply share my story and it blew up way more than I thought it would. Some misguided soul thought it would be good to change the post and mess the whole thing up. I take responsibility for what happens on my account, but this statements were not made by me. Obviously they have upset a lot of people and I wish I could meet each of you face to face to apologize.\\n\\nThis was not a stunt to try and get karma or awards. Again, some won’t believe that and that’s ok.\\n\\nIf you care, you can look at my original post on r/Banned to see where I was trying to understand why my name was offensive. You can also look at my post and comment history on this account and my new one to see that this was very clearly not me.\\n\\nI’m sorry everyone. I think I’m done with Reddit entirely. Minor background: I am a pretty affectionate, and at times, effeminate, dude. I\\'m 6\\'2 and have a pretty \"tough-guy\" background in that I was in special forces a while ago, and my roommates all served as well, but I also have thin wrists and sit on my friends\\' laps and blow kisses to them and shit. I\\'m not gay, I just am me.\\n\\nSo while I was in a shop with a roommate a few weeks ago he saw these really cool shawls that we both couldn\\'t get out of our heads; he returned last weekend to buy them and now we have these shawls. Mine makes me look like a Star Wars character and his looks like the Outlaw Josey Wales, these are seriously awesome shawls. The first night we wore them, everybody at the dive bar we went to (Re: dudes) thought they were awesome as well. Then this girl and her friend arrive on invite from Shawlbro, and they are seriously turned off by our sweet shawls. Like, acting pretty weird about them and making comments. Whatever. So I get a call from my GF, she\\'s tired and wants to hang out at mine, and so I bid these mean girls and Shawlbro adieu and head home.\\n\\nI\\'m still wearing the shawl when my GF arrives and she\\'s also really taken aback, she won\\'t even kiss me until I take it off. We get do the deed and go to sleep, and the next morning she starts asking me if I\\'m gay. And she\\'s really serious and aggressive about it. I tell her I\\'m not, that if I was I\\'d definitely know if by now, and she counters with her major evidence of the fact that I own a shawl. Anyway she gets weird and leaves, and then sends me a text later about how she\\'s sorry and that she \"needs to think about what kind of man\" she wants, and then doesn\\'t contact me for days. So yesterday I invite her out, she\\'s stumbling over her words and talking about how she likes tough guys and how she grew up in the south and needs to get used to The Big City, but that she doesn\\'t know this or that, and eventually I just tell her very politely to get fucked because I\\'m pretty insulted by this point. On the way back, now that I\\'m not directly in front of her, I get this long apologetic text from her but the crux of it is that yeah, she\\'s just not that into me anymore because I wore a shawl.\\n\\nLater on, I tell Shawlbro about this, and he also had a blowout with the girl he was seeing over his shawl that very same night we went out.\\n\\nWe are both going to keep wearing the shawls though, they are warm.\\n\\nTl;dr: Me and my friend bought cursed shawls and now we are single.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit:\\n\\nShe\\'s a nice girl, she\\'s just not pickin up what I\\'m puttin down. It\\'s a silly thing to be mad about.\\n\\nAnd by popular demand: [It\\'s shawl over for you hoes](https://imgur.com/a/XXCrcM5)\\n\\nEdit 2: [Shawlbro](https://imgur.com/a/ZvlS5N9) So this happened a few days ago and I’m still not sure I’m 100% ready to tell the story but here goes.\\n\\nI’ve been with my girlfriend for about a year and I already know she is the love of my life. She’s perfect for me. We’re perfect for eachother. We’re getting ready to move in with eachother and I want nothing more than to start a family with her and spend the rest of my life with her.\\n\\nWe went on a short vacation last week and when we returned she gave me her phone to look at some photos from the trip. \\n\\nShe went to the bathroom while I had her phone, and as I was scrolling through the pictures it kind of jumped to a period that was about a year and a half ago. If you have an iPhone you know what I’m talking about, you scroll a little bit too fast and all of a sudden you’re back at the start of the photo album. It’s annoying as hell.\\n\\nBut some photos caught my eye. Some photos that I really shouldn’t be seeing, of her and a previous boyfriend.\\n\\nThere she is, the love of my life, TRYING to get her mouth around the biggest dick I’ve ever seen in my life. I’ve watched porn - a lot. I’ve never seen a dick like this. I’m talking bigger than 2 coke cans stacked on top of eachother. Longer and thicker. As far as I could tell she was unable to get her teeth around it.\\n\\nI could see another thumbnail of her comparing the size of his dick to her forearm with a look of wonder and glee on her face.\\n\\nI closed the pictures and I’ve acted like nothing has happened, but I cannot get these images out of my mind. I’ve never been self-conscious about my dick size - in fact if you believe the stats I’m significantly above average, but this has destroyed my self esteem.\\n\\nWe haven’t had sex since. I can’t concentrate on my work. I just wish I had never seen those damn pictures.\\n\\nTL;DR accidentally saw some pictures of the love of my life sucking the biggest dick on earth and my stupid male ego is destroyed\\n\\nUPDATE: There’s a lot of people assuming that this was a one-night-stand. It wasn’t. She was with this guy for 3 years. I\\'m sitting in my room pretty horny and bored so I wanna go watch some porn\\n\\nand I always get these ads about pornhub live and I\\'ve never checked it out.\\n\\nSo I\\'m like, alright I\\'m gonna check it out, see what it\\'s all about\\n\\nI open it and I see all these hot girls. I go into a couple and on the right side, they have a chat where you can type. but in order to chat with the girls, I have to make an account.\\n\\nI entered my email, password, and they have something weird that is that you have to enter a username\\n\\nobviously didn\\'t wanna use my real name so I write the first name that comes to mind, jakob69420\\n\\nand then on the next page, it says. Enter your credit card,. I\\'m already skeptical but it says.. it\\'s 100% free, it\\'s only for if things get hot and you wanna donate\\n\\nand I\\'m like.. eeeeehhh... but I\\'m already so far in the process that I\\'m like ok fuck it.. let\\'s go\\n\\nSo now I\\'m in and I watch a few and they\\'re like just sitting there, they\\'re not really doing anything. nobody was showing any tits, a little ass shaking, but pretty underwhelming overall.\\n\\nSo to find the best one I just hold control on my keyboard and open a ton of tabs so I can find one that actually does something sexy.\\n\\nand I flip through these tabs at the top and it would popup this annoying thing that said. You can only watch one live stream at the time.\\xa0\\n\\nthis popup would come a few times where I had to click like an orange button to refresh.\\n\\nand then I land on this really old like 60-year-old gilf, and she\\'s just sitting there, there\\'s like 8 people watching live.\\n\\nthen there was a popup with an orange button and instinctively my mouse just goes to it and right as I\\'m about to click the button I see it says, enter private room $5 dollars.\\n\\nI click it, and I\\'m like.. \"No! o fuck!\" I\\'m not sad loosing $5 dollars but eh, couldn\\'t it be somebody that\\'s a little bit sexier?\\n\\nNow she\\'s like smiling and she say\\'s \"heeey Jakob\".. Immediately she\\'s pulling her tits out and she grabs a dildo laying next to her. she has this underwear on that has like a velcro flap, and she snaps it open and I can see this really old, slightly hairy pussy.\\xa0\\n\\nI\\'m like.. alright man, I fucking paid for this, so better give it a go, kinda like shamefully jacking off.\\n\\nNow she keeps saying Jakob over and over again, moaning, and I mean.. she puts on a pretty good show, she was pretty hot, but I mean she\\'s fucking 60...\\n\\nI start writing in the chat that she should talk dirty to me and shit.\\xa0\\n\\nI\\'m gonna spare you all the details, but after a few minutes I cum\\n\\nand I\\'m like, thank you, bye!\\xa0\\n\\nI Close the window and go back to watching youtube and chilling out.\\n\\nLater that night, I go to check my email, and I see this receipt from pornhub live and it turns out... it didn\\'t cost just $5... It cost $5 dollars per minute!!\\n\\nSo that\\'s how I spent $72 dollars on a 60-year-old woman calling me Jakob\\n\\n**TL;DR. I accidentally I spent $72 dollars on a 60-year-old woman calling me Jakob on Pornhub Live**  So, didn\\'t happen today, but last weekend. Finally getting around to really processing it all and I guess trying to deal with it.\\n\\nWent out for drinks with my girlfriend and met up with my younger cousin at the bar. We\\'d all hung out once before and had a great time. My cousin invited a couple of her friends to the bar too; we did some barhopping. I got shitfaced pretty unintentionally (The last bar was, I swear, not putting any mixers in my cocktails, they were straight alcohol). So anyway we\\'re about to leave and my cousin\\'s friends are trying to get her home, because she\\'s shitfaced too. Well, my gf was our DD so we offered to let her stay in our spare room. Everyone was cool with that because who\\'s safer than family, right?\\n\\nWrong. We get home and (I had to piece together some of this later because I blacked out for most of it) apparently initially everything was cool. My cousin went to the spare room and my gf got her situated. The problems started a little later when I, in my infinite wisdom, decided to walk straight out of my bedroom with my girlfriend in it, and into my cousin\\'s room. I don\\'t particularly remember much except for two details which I guess are not important to the story. Well, okay so one might be. I remember her giving me a *very* enthusiastic BJ, which, as you can imagine, makes a lot of noise. Apparently after a while my gf came out of the room wondering where I was because I just fucking disappeared. She didn\\'t barge into the room or anything, but she heard the noises which is pretty fucking obvious. So at that point, she left. Like, me. She left me, and I don\\'t blame her.\\n\\nAnyway that means I wake up the next morning, having blacked out, oblivious that my gf was gone already, but I\\'m fucking naked next to my naked cousin. There\\'s cum all over the bed where her face was, she didn\\'t even sleep with a pillow. There\\'s obviously no hiding this but I\\'m still half-drunk and I went to try to go sneak back into my room, which I found empty. So yeah.\\n\\nI haven\\'t heard from my gf all week, and I\\'m sure we\\'re done, and I don\\'t blame her. All I can hope for now is that this shit doesn\\'t get out to my family, because I would probably implode. No, my cousin and I are not going to start hooking up regularly. It\\'s actually super awkward and she has hardly said a word to me either. Again, I don\\'t blame her.\\n\\nTL;DR drunkenly slept with my cousin, ruined my relationship, family might hear about it, I\\'m an idiot. Recently, I traveled to Denver, Colorado with my wife and my wife\\'s parents.  As a resident of a non-legalized state -- and as someone who is too much of a pussy to regularly buy illegal drugs -- the thing I was looking forward to most was the chance to buy fancy legal weed.  What could possibly go wrong?\\n\\nSo the first thing I do upon arriving (and after successfully ditching the in-laws) is drag my wife to a nearby dispensary for a shopping spree.  And oh my god, it was just like in my dreams.  Tons of different options in neat little sample jars and a team of helpful stoners walking me through the various strains:  \\n\\n\"Are you looking for a mellow body high?  Or do you want something that gives you a bit more pep and energy?  Or are you just hoping for something light to take the stress off?\"\\n\\n\"Yes, yes and yes!\"  I reply eagerly, like a fat kid in a candy store, and request an eighth-ounce of about 7 different options.  In hindsight, if I learned anything from this experience, it is that my math and science teachers never taught me basic information, like \"what is an ounce?\" or \"how much weed can a person consume in a single weekend?\"  Sure, I can tell you when two speeding trains leaving separate stations will collide or recite Avogadro\\'s Number, but it turns out that **none** of that information is particularly relevant to getting high in a responsible and efficient manner.\\n\\nAnd it was at this dispensary that I also learned that you can\\'t actually smoke in public places (including the hotel that my wife and I were staying at).  As a result, before leaving, I begged my wife to buy some edibles that I could munch on until we found a place to properly get lit.  After expressing shock as to the absurd volume of drugs that we were buying (unlike me, she is the product of private school and understands the Imperial measurement system) she relents, and we walk out of the store with what felt like a dump truck of weed plus a small package of seemingly-innocuous gingersnap cookies.\\n\\nWhen we finally get back to the hotel room, I tear those bad boys open... only to find about a dozen tiny cookies roughly the size of a quarter.  What the fuck, Denver?  Seeing the skepticism (and hunger) in my eyes, my wife warns me that I should go easy and look at the back of the package first before trying one.\\n\\n\"Dose size: 1/2 cookie,\" I read silently as I start taking micro-bites from the edges, like a giant chinchilla gnawing on a sunflower seed.  But what kind of a savage only eats half a cookie?  So a second later, I covertly pop the remainder into my mouth. \\n\\nAnd then I quickly stuff another two cookies in my mouth for good measure the moment my wife turns her back.  We may not have legal weed back home, but I routinely devour an entire package of Milanos in one sitting without breaking a sweat.  Your move, tiny gingersnaps.   \\n\\nAbout 30 minutes later we are in the backseat of her parents\\' rental car on the way to dinner.  And that\\'s when things start to go tits-up.  My stomach growls.  Loudly and angrily.  My wife looks at me with inquisitive eyes that seem to say \"Diarrhea?\"  But I merely clutch my tummy and mumble something about altitude sickness.\\n\\n\"You didn\\'t eat a whole cookie, did you?\" she asks, 10% in genuine concern and 90% in seething irritation.\\n\\n\"Of course not.\" I respond, avoiding eye contact for the remainder of the car ride.\\n\\nA few minutes later we are climbing out of her parents\\' rental car and heading into some trendy farm-to-table restaurant.  I don\\'t remember how I made it to my seat, and I don\\'t remember even looking at the menu, but I do remember the concerned look on the waiter\\'s face as he asked me if I was doing alright.\\n\\n\"Keep it together, man,\"  I say to myself.  But my wife\\'s sudden groan suggests that I may have also said that to the waiter.  Things are going downhill fast.\\n\\nThe waiter nods sympathetically, takes our orders, and then heads to the next table. \\n\\nThe moment he walks away, my wife is staring daggers at me.  I start to worry that the jig is up.  \\n\\n\"You are sweating... from your entire face,\" she says with both pity and disgust.  Not quite knowing what to do, I reach for my napkin and proceed to blot my cheeks, nose, neck, chin and forehead.  \\n\\nAt this point, my wife\\'s mom looks over at me with some concern.  \"Are you alright?\" she asks kindly.\\n\\n\"Yeah, the food\\'s just a bit spicy,\" I reply, far too quick to realize that we had literally just ordered and that there is **nothing** on the table except for a basket of dinner rolls.   \\n\\nMy wife kicks me under the table to grab my attention. \\n\"Bathroom. Now.\" she hisses. \"Get it together.\"  I reluctantly get up from the table and head for the toilet.  After splashing several handfuls of water on my face, I approach a urinal and start to pee.  \\n\\nNow, one of the more disconcerting effects of those tiny gingersnap monsters is the feeling that time has become untethered from reality.  As I am peeing, I start to get the very unsettling feeling that I have been taking a piss for the better part of an hour and that my wife must be pacing around the restaurant worried about me.\\n\\nBut deep down I know that is absurd:  I\\'ve been peeing all my life, sometimes multiple times a day.  I\\'ve probably taken more than 50,000 leaks, and it usually only takes about a minute at most.  So given that my typical pee is no more than 60 seconds -- and given that it feels like I am about half way done -- that means that I\\'ve probably only been standing here about 30 seconds, right?\\n\\nBut the guy at the urinal next to me doesn\\'t respond, and instead starts shuffling away from me mid-stream, like a startled penguin.  I try, albeit unsuccessfully, to break eye-contact. \\n\\nAfter finally finishing, I again splash some water on my face and return to my seat, making sure to apologize to the table \"for being gone such a long time\" just in case my math was off. \\n\\nNext, I try briefly to engage in small talk with my wife\\'s father, but I am far too high to understand what either of us are saying.  Not wanting to start laughing uncontrollably at the wrong moment --\\n or, really, at any moment -- I figure the safest idea is to nod my head periodically and drink a ton of water.  Nothing cures mental fatigue like water, right?  To my wife\\'s horror, I stand up, grab my water glass and thrust it out to the waiter, who unfortunately is on the opposite side of the restaurant.  But he turns out to be really cool and, after making his way over to our table, tells me that he\\'ll do his best to keep me stocked with ice water for the rest of the meal.  He also helpfully suggests that if the dinner rolls aren\\'t too spicy for me, I should probably eat one or two so that I\\'m not sitting there on an empty stomach.\\n\\nSmart man. \\n\\nHowever, after going through all of the bread on the table and three glasses of water, I start to get worried that I need actual food to offset the growing paranoia from those tiny gingersnap devils.  \"Do you think I should flag down the waiter again and ask what\\'s taking so long?\" I suggest helpfully to my wife.\\n\\n\"What?! We literally just ordered three fucking minutes ago.\"\\n\\nAnd at that exchange, my wife loses her cool.  \"HOW MANY COOKIES DID YOU EAT?!\" she demands.\\n\\n\"Whoa, easy there, Torquemada,\" I respond, somewhat horrified at her outburst.  \"I had a few cookies, but keep it down.  I don\\'t want your parents to know how fucked up I am right now.\"\\n\\n\"REALLY?!  THEY ARE SITTING TWO FEET AWAY FROM YOU.  THEY KNOW.\"\\n\\nI look up and for the first time notice both of my in-laws just staring at me... for what literally felt like an eternity.\\n\\nTL;DR: ate way too many edibles on a trip and wigged out during a dinner with my wife and her parents.\\n\\n\\nEDIT:  Wow!  Thanks everyone for all the love (and for even some of the hate)!  I think I have officially peaked in life.\\n\\nAs for Part II of the story, there\\'s a reason -- or, technically, 3 delicious reasons -- why it was cut short.  At that point, my wife\\'s singular focus was on getting me out of the restaurant before I either puked all over the table or pissed myself (or an unsightly combination of both).  So after a few spastic, two-handed waves \"good-bye\" to my in-laws, she rushed me to the door like a Secret Service agent evacuating the president.  My night after that was a whirlwind of barfing and groveling, mixed with a few vain attempts at \"getting handsie\" back in the hotel room.  But being the absolute awesome sweetie that she is, my wife stuck with me through the whole nightmare, whispering over and over in my ear: \"Please don\\'t die, we have a mortgage.\" Obligatory this actually happened a little over a year ago, and throwaway because I don\\'t want people on my main account to know what I do for a living.\\n\\nSo, I work for the TSA, and have for a few years now. It\\'s a good job overall. I\\'m underpaid, but the benefits are nice, and I get overtime when I want it.\\n\\nA little over a year ago, during the week leading up to Christmas, we had some really bad weather that delayed all the flights. I volunteered to stay late so that my coworkers could go home to their families. Most of the work was done anyway, so it was mostly just standing around waiting for the odd latecomer\\n\\nI was working the AIT (the space tube thingy), when three passengers came up together, a middle-aged man, a middle-aged woman, and a teenage boy. I figure it\\'s a family traveling together for the holidays, and go about my work.\\n\\nMom goes through, all is fine. Dad goes through, all is fine.\\n\\nKid comes up, I get a good look at him. Hoodie, sweatpants, shortish hair, smooth face. I figure he\\'s about 13, maybe 14.\\n\\nI hit the button, direct him to wait with me for a moment, and then gesture to the screen, which lit up on his chest area.\\n\\nI tell him that I have to pat that area down. He\\'s a little nervous, I figure that because he\\'s so young, this is probably his first time getting a pat down, but he says okay, and I start the patdown.\\n\\nI do the left side of the chest, and feel some moob, which catches me off guard because he didn\\'t look chubby at all.\\n\\nI move to the right side of the chest, read what\\'s on the hoodie, and it all clicks at once. The hoodie has the name of the local college on it. This is an adult, not a child. He\\'s not wearing sweatpants, \\\\*she\\\\* is wearing yoga pants. She doesn\\'t even know the couple that just came through.\\n\\nI look at her face, which is bright red, my hand is still on her boob, and I pull it back like I just got bit by a snake.\\n\\nI immediately call for my supervisor, who comes over and asks what\\'s wrong, and I explain the situation to her.\\n\\nMy supervisor covers her mouth, and at first I thought she was absolutely mortified, but then I realized she\\'s trying not to laugh.\\n\\nShe takes a minute to pull herself together, tells me to go take a break, and finishes screening the passenger herself.\\n\\nOnce that was done, I apologize to the passenger, she tells me it\\'s fine, that it wasn\\'t the first time she was mistaken for a boy, and she probably should have said something before I started touching her. I leave her alone, and go talk to my supervisor to figure out exactly how fired I am.\\n\\nShe tells me to calm down, that it was just an honest mistake, and that she has my back if the passenger files an official complaint, but that probably won\\'t happen, and I shouldn\\'t be worried.\\n\\nThat reassured me a little, but I still groped a woman and ruined Christmas, so I feel like an absolute monster.\\n\\nI swallow my shame, and finish my shift, then I go into the airport proper to find some food, because I just finished a twelve hour shift and there\\'s no way I have the energy to cook dinner.\\n\\nI saw my hapless victim sitting at her gate, waiting for her flight. I went up to her to apologize again, and saw that the flight had been delayed until morning (it was about eleven at night).\\n\\nI apologize again, she says it\\'s fine, and I ask her if she\\'s planning to stay the whole night. She says she has to, all the hotels in the area are book.\\n\\nI tell her that I\\'m getting some dinner, and offer to get her some food as well. After all, I already got to second base, I think it\\'s only fair that I buy her dinner.\\n\\nShe agrees, and we go to one of the restaurants that is open late, get some food, and start eating.\\n\\nShe said she gets mistaken for a boy a lot, and it\\'s not a big deal. I told her about how I had long hair and no beard in college, and at the gym people would frequently walk into the men\\'s bathroom, see me, and do a double take to make sure they didn\\'t walk into the ladies\\' room.\\n\\nShe laughed, and we ended up talking for a few hours, before I finally told her that I had to get home, and apologized again for the accidental molestation.\\n\\nShe said that all is forgiven, if I promise to take her on a real date when she gets back.\\n\\nI agreed, she gave me her phone number, and I went home, and immediately started texting her. We kept talking until her flight finally left, and when she got back I picked her up at the airport, and a few days later took her on that date that I promised her.\\n\\nWe just celebrated our one year anniversary.\\n\\nShe has long hair now.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\ntl;dr: Thought an adult woman was a teenage boy, touched her on the boob, everything worked out better than expected. I’m couch-surfing with my sister and her BF; I work for him at the lake-side bar, trying to pay for college. My state is “open” and while I’m not thrilled, I need both the job and my scored sofa accommodations to make it work. To give them their space, and myself a break from the doomscrolling, I take a run by the lake in the mornings. This lake is bombass and draws scuba divers to the flooded town at the bottom.\\n\\nToday, I was in my own head running when a dark mass floated to the surface 40 feet away. I was on the craggy side of the lake and this dude looked dead. D.E.A.D. Facing away from me, his head was tipped back, eyes closed, bobbing like a fishing lure. No one else was around, so I thought he was quantum crazy out here scuba diving alone at the crackass of dawn, giving himself the bends or some nonsense.\\n\\nLike a jackass, I didn’t yell at him to check-in. Instead, I toed off my shoes and stripped to my skivvies to save the imbecile. The movie trailer in my head had me taking three glorious steps and launching into the deep blue water, black widow style. Instead, my tender feet hit the sharp rocks and I contorted under the pain like a slinky as I uncoordinatedly pitched myself into the water, doing a side-flop. I was also wearing my contacts so I swam hard in his direction with my eyes closed.\\n\\nWhen I open them, he was dead-ass staring at me like I’d lost my ever-lovin’ mind, so I blurted, “Are you okay?”\\n\\nHe removed the regulator and incredulously said “yes”.\\n\\nMy brain blue-screened while I tread water. The lake felt infinitely deep. Before I could terrify myself by hearing the jaws theme song, I turned to nope the hell out of there, yelling over my shoulder, “I thought you needed saving” to explain my idiocy.\\n\\nAs I pivoted, another dude cleared his throat from 30 feet away on the other side. I never heard a sound from him so I freaked out, failing and belting an ear wounding scream at him.\\n\\nBoth asshats laughed as a few more heads surfaced around us. I was surrounded by divers all wildly entertained by my ridiculous high-octane FU. After pointing to me and the beach, the merman that was my original target cautiously swam toward me after I nodded and “escorted” me to the shore.\\n\\nThe beach was much further than I had anticipated, so I was trying to low-key breath, hiding my need to suck all of the O2 from the air. Also, the comedy of the situation consumed me and I started to giggle. Finally, I joked, “Dude, you are lucky you weren’t actually dying because It would have taken everything I have to drag your sorry ass this far.”\\n\\nHe chuckled before offering me a “tow.”\\n\\n“Hell, no! Not gonna happen.” Even if I had to dog paddle, I wouldn’t openly accept that defeat.\\n\\nHe quietly mocked me the rest of the way to the shore. I’m a secret sap for it.\\n\\nThey were cadets or recent graduates from a military college, here for the summer. They’ve been training in pools and were doing some “open water” exercises; they had been out there at least part of the night. I’m sure I blew-up whatever drill they were running. He’s training for pre-dive school (?) and since I am an expert googler, I’m guessing that means combat diving.\\n\\nAt the shore, I did my best to throw my shoulders back and march out of the water in my sports bra and undies in front of what I can only imagine are some pretty badass men. I did invite him and his clandestine crew for an absurdly overpriced beer at the bar tonight before shame-jogging back into the woods for my clothes.\\n\\nTL;DR I tried to save an injured diver-ended up crashing some kind of military training.\\n\\nEDIT: It\\'s Lake Jocassee in SC. Also, the mereman cheated: he was wearing a floaty vest and fins, that bastard. Ok, I’ll admit there is a part of me that is attracted to his mysterious appearance from the shadow realm, and I’m definitely imaging that he’s constructed from some kind of aluminum steel alloy, but he was also funny and kind. I was vibing his proclivity for witty and sarcastic comments and have a million questions I want to ask him. Ha\\n\\nEDIT2: Okay, at work now and had to turn off the notifications because you snippers are blowing me up. To all the ladies giving advice earlier...yes, I left the dragon-flies at home and went full cute sundress and Jesus sandals. Tried to wear my hair straight, but it\\'s hot as hate out here and it\\'ll be beach wave sweaty before long. My sister\\'s BF has blabbed the whole thing and all of the staff is in full-on ribbing mode. Kinda great actually. They are currently reading the Reddit post so they are cackling at you people too. So, even if he doesn\\'t show, we\\'re gonna have a great night. We have a long way to go since it\\'s just the dinner crowd, but thanks for making my day great people.\\n\\nEDIT3: Solid dinner crowd, but no mereman, or frog prince as you people have started to call him. Our lakeside drinking crew will start rolling in another 1-2 hours. I thought you salty bastards of TIFU would chew me up and spit me out, but look at you all showing up in the name of love! You guys are awesome, even if I get ditched it was worth the day with you.\\n\\nEDIT4: 1 hor later. Still no show :(\\n\\nEDIT5: HE SHOWED! Holy shit, a little bit ago. Yes, I was as dorky as you would have imagined and now I’m typing this from the bathroom like a dumbass again, but I feel like you people are on the ride with me. He’s handsome and funny and he smells great. Yes, I hugged him. I’m southern…its what we do…not the smelling, the hugging. He’s nice, and smart and keeps defending me from my jackass friends at the bar, who have almost called him merman to his face. I think he low-key likes that everyone knew who he was, but not sure how he’ll feel about being a Reddit celebrity. I’ve learned a lot about him, but it wouldn’t be fair to share without his permission. His whole crew did not come, only one and his bud immediately started flirting with my co-worker. That’s a good sign. I think. Holy, shit you’d think I’d never met up with a guy before. Also, my friend straight up asked him if he saw my “dragonfly undies that look like penises with MASSIVE, glow-in-the-dark turquoise blue balls” only she used the Reddit version  (thanks for that nickname Reddit). He didn’t answer but smirked the truth to me after she left. It was cheeky but cute. He’s also been sharing some of the shit that he\\'s been taking today from being “saved”. He has the same self-deprecating sense of humor as me. I think we are vibing. So, that’s all the updates for tonight. He’s getting the rest of my attention. Keep sending me those good vibes and peace people.\\n\\nEDIT6: Last and final update because you guys are not letting up. I know this may seem weird since I posted this whole situation out into cyberspace for everyone to see, but yesterday it was just a comical story about a guy I didn\\'t think I would ever see again. Something funny to share when we all need a giggle. Today...well...it feels different to talk about him now that we\\'ve spent some time together. I like him. There’s chemistry and similar interest and we have plans to see each other again. I don’t need the pressure of Reddit to help me screw things up. You guys know I’m a bit of an expert in that regard. That’s all, so go do something you love and find a way to at least balance the doomscrolling with some belly laughs. Sending much love to each of you.\\n\\nEDIT7: “Updates!” You people keep screaming over 3 weeks later. Don’t you have better things to do than pester me about my love life? Ha. The merman, the frog prince, the dashing man from depths, the king of the shadow realm (and the many other nicknames that Reddit has bestowed) is still very much in my life. He’s better than I can describe with my mortal words. Fangirl him if you must because I will understand. Thank you all for the well-wishes and positivity that this post has given. I hope something amazing and magical happens to each of you, and if it happens to be shamefully funny, I hope you will share because we all need as many laughs as we can get. Be safe, everyone. I\\'m a 32 year old woman who can never go back to my new dentist after two visits because I\\'m an idiot. \\n\\nMy dentist is a very nice and professional man. Our first appointment was going pretty smoothly until he made some innocuous remark about us \"being strangers.\" My immediate reply was \"oh, you\\'re not a stranger! You\\'ve been inside of my mouth for 20 minutes!\" I did NOT intend to make a sexual joke. His face turned red and he was clearly embarrassed but he continued on like a true professional and we were probably both relieved when the appointment was over. \\n\\nI had my second dentist appointment today. I actually mentally prepared myself to be a model patient who didn\\'t say anything weird, thank you very much. He had been working in my mouth for about 5 minutes when he started to seem really uncomfortable or something. His face was red and he was breathing a little heavier. I was a bit concerned and also confused. Like how could I have embarrassed him this time? I had hardly spoken! So he keeps working in there and then I realize what the hell is happening. My dentist was wearing grape flavored gloves. I had been absentmindedly licking his fingers the whole time. \\n\\nNever going back.\\n\\nTL;DR  Today I fucked up by licking my dentist This literally just happened. I was discussing this subreddit with a guy (we’ll call him M) I’m flirting with... and we come across the hot sauce story, felt like it sounded like our mutual friend (he can be called B)\\n\\nSo I take a screenshot and go to send it on FB messenger to send to B.... muscle memory kicks in and I send the photo so quick my camera roll hadn’t updated... I accidentally sent a nude I’d taken half hour earlier. \\n\\nThis wouldn’t be an issue usually... but this guy is like a brother figure. He’s not answering his phone so I’ve just spammed the fuck out of the conversation to stop it popping up.\\n\\nAll the while I’m on the phone to M, the initial intended recipient....who is also in a band with B. \\n\\n\\nFor anyone curious here’s me [trying to claw it back](https://imgur.com/gallery/888ILDh)\\n\\nTLDR; tried to send a screenshot to a friend. Sent my tits instead.  Ughhhhhhhhhhh\\n\\nUpdate: if this gets 666 upvotes I’ll post the photo.\\n\\nEdit: hi Dan. I know you’re lurking ahahahhaha\\n\\nUpdate: I love you all. You’ve cured my depression. Let me be your [big tiddy goth gf](https://imgur.com/a/WqWZqtc)\\n\\nEdit: Oh my god gold!!!!!\\n\\n\\n*I NOW KNOW FB MESSENGER HAS A DELETE FUNCTION* thanks, I hate it. This happened to me yesterday and I\\'m still baffled.\\n\\nIt all started when I posted a comparison picture of a dog which looks like the actor William H. Macy. I couldn\\'t stop laughin over it but I never thought it would gain so much attention. \\n\\nHowever it ended up on the front page with much more upvotes I could have imagined. This alone was crazy for me because I never expected to have a submission on the front page.\\n\\nWhen I checked my phone the next morning my reddit inbox exploded over the sheer amount of youtube links I received. I checked them and found my submission on the latest Jimmy Kimmel Show with Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian. I was mind blown over this.\\n\\nThey proceeded talking over reddit users and Jimmy ended up checking my history. Well I hardly ever post filthy stuff but I commented on a NSFW TIFU a few days ago and I think Jimmy thought it was my submission at the short glance he took.\\n\\nKeep in mind they even named and showed my username - he made it look like there was a lot of filthy stuff going on in my history so this was quite embarrassing for me and Im getting a lot of crazy messages now.\\n\\nI don\\'t know if this perfectly qualifies for a TIFU but on the one hand it felt like one, when he revealed my history with \\'filthy stuff\\' as he said. On the other hand it\\'s just cool and a story to tell. However I regret nothing!\\n\\ntl;dr: Jimmy Kimmel had Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian as a guest. They ended up browsing my reddit history and Jimmy made it look like there\\'s filthy stuff going on.\\n\\nLink to the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vzkw2zD7gE&t=9s (starts at 2:10)\\n\\n\\nOH and thanks for the gold! Things are going so fast here I didnt even see it until now. Thank you unknown and kind strangers!\\n\\n My buddy and I ordered a pizza last night. Unaware that I already paid with my debit card, I walk to my door with $30 and gave him a 20% tip on top of that which had been paid online.\\n\\nThe driver was about in his mid 30\\'s, barely spoke English and he was driving a beat up car. He said \"thank you!\" very enthusiastically which made me realize in about 2 seconds that I just gave him double the money for the order, which he would obviously receive as a tip. I was about to admit my mistake and ask for the money back... before I saw his reaction while he was walking to his car.\\n\\nHe had a smile from ear to ear like he found the cure for Covid or struck gold or something. He even did this little mini jump before he hopped into his car. I\\'m not exactly Bill Gates, I still have debts to pay, but I\\'m glad I fucked up to help someone who needed the money more than I did.\\n\\nAnyways, I felt pretty dumb after, but the joy I saw in that man made my week. Not a very interesting story, but it was pretty cool for me, as my Dad moved to Canada from across the world with only a bike and a few hundred bucks.\\n\\nTL;DR Paid double for a pizza by being drunk. No regrets. Ok... little to no regrets. EDIT: I got an AMA thread now. Help me: \\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/6rwl9z/tifu_by_being_the_guy_who_cummed_into_a_coconut/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=new&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=tifu\\n\\n\\nThis TIFU didn\\'t happen today but quite a few years back. For obvious reasons I\\'m using a throwaway account as my family knows my main reddit username. \\n\\n-------------------------\\n\\nAnyway, around 8 years back I lived in Northern Mozambique, a coastal southern African country with quite a warm climate. My mother at the time was going through a \\'health nut\\' phase and only buying foods she deemed healthy enough. One of these was coconuts. She would buy several coconuts a week to use in food from the local market.\\n\\n\\nAnyway, being a horny teenager I fapped in regular intervals. Unfortunately there was some severely stressful examinations coming up for me and as such my fapping reached a higher peak then usual and I was feeling pretty sexually frustrated. One day I hear that my mother is going to be out for pretty much the entire afternoon. Horny me decides that it would be a fantastic idea to fuck a coconut. Honestly to this day I can\\'t fathom why I thought that would be a good idea but my train of thought back then was clearly somewhat clogged. \\n\\n\\nI end up grabbing the coconut drill and through 20ish minutes of *concerted* effort end up creating a hole large enough for me to stick my porker into. I decide it requires some lube and grab the nearest slippery thing (some butter) before shoving it into the coconut followed shortly by my meat. I fuck the coconut and it actually feels pretty damn good so I blow my load, shove the coconut under my bed and continue about my day. \\n\\n--------------------\\n\\nFor the next week the coconut is my saviour. Whenever I want to get off I simply take it out and fuck it in its *delightfully* tight hole made better each time by accumulating volumes of my semen and butter acting as a lubricant. It\\'s heaven. Now before I continue I\\'d best mention that at the time our area was experiencing quite humid, muggy weather which exacerbated an already existing fly problem. Disgustingly fat, bloated flies were commonly found around our house and the exterminators couldn\\'t really do anything because it was a localized area problem that would \"go away in the winter\". \\n\\n\\nAbout a week and a bit after the initial coconut fuck (I had been using it pretty much every day since then) I begin to notice a few more flies than usual as well as an odd, unpleasant smell about my room. Must be the coconut right? So I decide that I\\'ll fuck it once more before I throw it out and get a new one.\\n\\n\\n**Worst mistake I have ever made.**\\n\\n\\nYou see, the reason for the increased number of flies was that the coconut was evidently, in hindsight, a nearly perfect place to lay eggs. As I penetrate the coconut one last time I begin to feel a strange wriggling sensation. Puzzled, I pull my cock out to discover that it is COVERED in rotted and moldy butter and semen and *TEEMING WITH TINY FUCKING MAGGOTS*. They were wriggling all over my dick head and some were even trying to force their way up into my urethra. \\n\\n\\nI screamed, and threw the coconut against the wall which made the situation worse by spilling the contents. Hours of vigorous cock scrubbing, vomiting, and cleaning the remnants were spent reflecting on what the fuck I was doing with my life. \\n\\n\\n**Never again. NEVER AGAIN.**\\n\\n\\nTL;DR Don\\'t fuck coconuts.\\n\\n\\n\\nEDIT: Jesus this exploded. I\\'m glad my maggoty experience made some people laugh, because I sure cry everytime I think back to it.\\n\\nEDIT 2: RIP inbox\\n\\nEDIT 3: Thanks for the gold. It eases my shame a little. I\\'m thinking of doing an AMA for you more curious individuals. Maybe if the post hits 10K - it\\'s quite uncomfortable to discuss though as the visceral memories come back\\n\\nEDIT 4: My shame has never been this large. 47.1K upvotes. My story of coconut fucking is now permanently etched into reddit\\'s history. Lord save me. Obligatory this happened several months ago, tl;dr at bottom.\\n\\nMy son has autism (level 1, previously called aspergers) and due to that he also has a psychiatrist, multiple psychologists and doctors. We decided to get a new primary doctor who works closely with his other providers to better coordinate his care this past summer. I brought my son in for a standard \"well child\" visit, and spent nearly an hour with this new doctor going over his issues, and medications, history etc.\\n\\nToward the end of the visit she says to me, \"Well, he can get the gardasil vaccine today,\" to which I reply, \"Oh, no he can\\'t have that, I don\\'t want him to get autism.\"\\n\\nI should maybe note here that I am an aspie too, and while I think my sarcasm is on point, I must have been a little too serious looking because she just stared at me. The silence lasted an eternity while I imagine she was deciding how to proceed. Eventually I laughed and tried to assure her I was only kidding, but she only returned a nervous sounding chuckle and left the room.\\n\\nAs my son and I were discussing whether I was offensive (he thought I was hilarious) in walked the nurse with a stack of information about vaccines. He started his lecture about vaccine safety and potential risks, etc. and no amount of my assurances that we are not in fact anti-vax would stop him. He just kept saying, \"Okay, well I have to tell you this,\" in a way that suggested that the doctor told him to give me the full spiel. \\n\\nTl;dr: Jokingly told my son\\'s new doctor that I didn\\'t want him to get *more* autism, got a 15 minute lecture on vaccine safety for my already fully vaccinated kid.\\n\\nEdit: Of course we took the gardasil. Shout out to nurse Pete for being the first nurse to ever give my kid a vaccine without him crying or fist-fighting everyone. I wish everyone could have a nurse Pete. Also, since I\\'m editing, thanks for the awards! So, three months ago or whenever it was that the Quarantine started I started an online course for a few subjects. To provide some background, these aren’t my school classes or anything and I’ve never met these people before. There are maybe ten other kids in class and the teacher is actually pretty great. \\n\\nSo the first two days go pretty well but on the third day I fuck up big time. We were in between a Physics class that had already been going on for an hour and I’d completely gotten distracted half way through. I have an incredibly low attention span and this was already too much for me. \\n\\nWhen the teacher called my name to answer his question, I had no idea what he’d been talking about so I tried to google it. However I have shitty internet so it took like really long to load and the teacher was getting pissed as to why I wasn’t responding and why I was typing. So, completely freaking out I decided to text him on the Google Meet chat and make an excuse that my laptop’s audio AND microphone are not working today and I’ve been reading the subtitles which take quite some time to load so I hadn’t quite gotten his question. \\n\\nIn my immense panic I phrased this somewhat vaguely and said - *I can’t actually hear I’ve been reading the subtitles they take quite some time to load*\\n\\nTo which the instructor said - *Oh! I’m so sorry. I wasn’t aware that you are deaf*\\n\\nIn my intense panic and anxiety I just went along with it. \\n\\nDumb as fuck.\\n\\nIt actually worked out fine, I’d type out all the answers sent to me and even bought a hearing aid that I sometimes wore in class. Now I say *sometimes* because I don’t actually have the focus and commitment to remember to put it on every class. When asked about it I told the people in class that even with the hearing aid I can’t hear much so I don’t usually bother wearing it. They bought it. \\n\\nEveryone in class likes me a lot now too and they find me very endearing. There’s a girl, Carla who says I have the most beautiful smile she’s ever seen. So this was actually going really well for me. \\n\\nBut like most of my antics, this backfired on me big time. \\n\\nWhen I made this godforsaken decision all that time ago I was sure I’d get away with it. We were never going to meet irl. However, about a week ago the instructor decided to meet irl as the lockdown in my country has been lifted. I spent all night watching videos of deaf people and trying to figure out how to behave. I decided to pretend to also be completely dumb so I wouldn’t have to try to speak like them. It seemed very hard and I didn’t want to try. \\n\\nSo anyway we meet up and everything goes well. No one uncovers my secret or anything. I spend the entire irl meet with Carla who is completely fucking stunning in real life. She’s smart, she’s funny, she’s kind. We keep handing each other notes on tissue papers and it’s the cutest shit ever. I haven’t ever been this attracted to anyone in my entire life. Toward the end of the meet however, Carla hands me a tissue paper with one little heartbreaking sentence on it.\\n\\n*Will you date me?*\\n\\nFuck. \\n\\nPanicking, I tell her I need some time to think and she’s chill with it. \\n\\nI’m supposed to be meeting up with her tomorrow. I can’t pretend to be deaf and dumb while dating her it’s fucking impossible but if I have to keep this charade up I’ll have to let her go and I don’t want to do that either.\\n\\nThere’s also the other option where I tell her it was all an act. Best case scenario is the extreme embarrassment + amazing girlfriend and the worst case scenario is she thinks I’m an asshole and I lose her anyway. \\n\\ntl;dr - I pretended to be deaf because I wasn’t paying attention in class and now I might be missing out an amazing girlfriend.\\n\\nEdit - She just texted me what time to pick her up. The date is actually TONIGHT not tomorrow so I have way lesser time to make this decision than I expected. Haha, I’m like a disaster that keeps on happening. Anyways, you should have an update in about 6-7 hours which is when I’ll meet her.\\n\\nUPDATE - So this is the update y’all have been waiting for, I just got back from the date with Carla.\\n\\nSo basically I prepared really hard for the date, googled what the appropriate flowers for apologizing for your lies are and got her White Orchids. I then put on my best clothes and set out. \\n\\nShe’d come to the date with a cute little notepad and two pencils for us to write notes in which melted me instantly but I was so anxious and nervous that at first I couldn’t bring myself to tell her. But as we sat waiting for our order to arrive, I kinda snapped cause of guilt and scribbled down into the notebook.\\n\\n*Hey, there’s not easy way to break this but I’m not actually deaf . . . . . Or dumb*\\n\\nTo which she replied with,\\n\\n*I know you’re not deaf but you ARE pretty dumb :)*\\n\\nAt which point I said *What the fuck* out loud.\\n\\nShe then laughed and explained that she’d thought I was so cute that she’d googled me long ago and found my Instagram which has highlighted stories from concerts where I’m screaming and vibing. So she only asked me out to figure out for how long I’d keep it going. \\n\\nSo she was actually playing me the whole time.\\n\\nI was feeling pretty bummed that she only wanted to date me for that but nevertheless I apologized profusely and showed her the Reddit post to explain myself. \\n\\nBest.move.ever. (Thank you so much everyone in the comments who asked me to do this)\\n\\nShe found the post funny and cute and ‘adorkable’. I told her I totally understand if she wants to end the date now but she didn’t! We had a great time and aren’t officially dating or anything but we did set a second date for next Wednesday.\\n\\nShe also told me that while she understands why I did what I did and that anxiety, especially social anxiety is so hard to deal with but she also believes that I was a little offensive especially with the hearing aid. She explained to me why that was so insensitive and I’d like to apologize for anyone I might have offended on here, it really wasn’t my intention!\\n\\nAlso, for our second date we’re planning to volunteer at a centre for deaf kids so I can redeem myself. \\n\\nThank you fucking Reddit, y’all might’ve just got me a girlfriend! Today I had been looking forward to the qualifying for the Formula 1 this weekend, and was browsing Reddit whilst also watching some older Formula 1 footage on YouTube. So it got me wondering, “Some of these races used to really get me super excited for them, now they’re just boring and far too controlled”. So I posed the question to /r/Formula1 to ask their opinions also. Shortly after posting, it transpired that the way I had asked the question could be perceived as...A little...’Hitlerish’. Check out the link below ~~smash that subscri~~. It somehow grabbed the attention of many people, and managed to get to #1 of /r/all and now my inbox is broken. Unfortunately for me, I am very anally retentive with things such as e-mails, texts, etc. that I must open every single one. It would actually play on my mind so badly that I wouldn’t be able to sleep if I didn’t open them, so I must open and read EVERY GODDAMN COMMENT. Probably the worst thing to have to feel the need to do if you plan on making it to the front page. I thought it was slowing down, because it got to a point where I was reading messages faster than they were coming, and the number of notifications was going down. But then, ~~everything changed when the fire nat~~ USA woke up. And I’ve been playing catch-up ever since. Took an opportunity to make this post since the message count was less than 100. Let’s see what I go back to now...\\n\\nLink: https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/bnaceq/if_you_could_eliminate_a_race_within_the_year/\\n\\nEDIT: Thank you for the gildings you’re all giving me, it’s rather overwhelming.\\n\\nThe original post has now made it to be #1 post of all time in /r/Formula1 somehow. \\n\\nAs of 19:42PM GMT, I still have over 600 responses to read through. I will be reading them all, but I won’t necessarily be responding to them all.\\n\\nI’m really glad that I could make a lot of you smile and laugh today, that wasn’t the original intention, but it’s a great positive to take away from this experience!\\n\\nEDIT 2: UPDATE - At around 20:20PM GMT, I opened up AlienBlue on my iPad to read these comments faster than on the official Reddit app, and when I started from there I had 934 unread messages. 20 minutes later, reading the messages and making some replies, I now have 976 unread messages -.-\\n\\nEDIT 3: UPDATE - It’s now 21:09PM GMT, I did have my inbox down to about 900 at one point, but now it’s back up in the 4 digits. I am seriously sleep deprived right now, I have been awake since 16:00PM yesterday, being unable to sleep due to coughing fits. Finally they’ve subsided and I’m feeling really tired now, so I shall pick up reading and responding tomorrow. Goodnight to you all, very bizarre experience today. I honestly didn’t think this TIFU post would blow up like my first post, but it seems to have done so much faster and on a much larger scale. \\n\\nEDIT 4: Finally I’m able to read the comments and messages faster than they are coming in. Back down under 1000 left to go now, and it’s been a truly interesting experience. I didn’t realise how quickly and openly people would comment something racist, I also didn’t expect some of the truly deplorable messages I have received, but thankfully they have been in the minority. It’s 6:00AM GMT here so time to soldier on until the end of the inbox!\\n\\nEDIT 5: Final edit, I’m now up to date with all my inbox now, 10:17AM. It’s been great to see this happen, and I’m sorry to those who thought Reddit was accepting casual racism for a brief moment\\n\\nTL;DR - Made a post asking a question, worded it wrong and now everyone thinks I’m a racist bastard. I think I have wasted my whole life to be honest.\\n\\nI am Joe, I have been a lurking for a while. I created this account to get my story across, I have no idea what I am planning to achieve by doing so, but I hope it can help those who are at crossroads and are stuck between passion and safety.\\n\\nFor the past 15 years of life, I have been a dentist, a path that I chose after leaving a job to study further in the hopes I will make more money. I do not even know why I cared about money when I did not even spend any of it. I met my wife before I started school, when I was 20, when I was a risktaker, a dreamer and wanted to change the world.\\n\\nNow I’m in a place where I have chronic pain, a cheating wife, kids who don’t love me, a life of staring into mouths all day, a dull brain, no more passions and hopes, no real purpose in life.\\n\\nI wanted to work as a social worker or an educator, but my parents and wife thought that I could help people in other ways that pay well. They convinced me to take dentistry and I did. I hated every minute of school, I did not want to be in a place where my back would ache, neck would ache and it was not solving the real cause of the problem, but just the result of what happens after people let go of their teeth. All my friends convinced me that it will be rewarding, and I will make a lot of money when I am out of school and I let them.\\n\\nWhen I was a young man, I wanted to do so many things, I used to play music, I wanted to become a musician, I wanted to be a teacher raising future people who could change the world. I loved physics and mathematics, but my parents told me to follow money instead of passions.\\n\\nToday I have 2 kids, a wife and they all expect me to provide them with a luxurious lifestyle. I have never cared for money, the most enjoyable time in my life was when I was sleeping on a futon in a rental running a small business selling jars of jam made with strawberries from a local farm and also working as a tutor for a bunch of spoilt kids. I had very little, but I was happy, I feel like I should have become an educator/business owner instead of taking a career I hate.\\n\\nFrom the past 15 years, I have developed chronic pain from doing dentistry, gained at least 20 kilos, made a million dollars but for what? I can’t even do anything because of chronic back pain.\\n\\nAfter becoming a dentist, I worked 9-4, 5 days a week,  I would come back home exhausted, plan my next day, manage the business side of things, have dinner with my kids and wife, sleep and repeat. Have a few weeks here and there as holidays where I would take my family away for a vacation.\\n\\nMy kids don’t even talk to me anymore, my wife and I have not had sex for months and I’m 100% that she’s cheating on me with a better-looking man who is older than me, I have seen her phone and confirmed this, but I will not bring it up because I don’t have anyone except her left in my life, she has been my only support throughout this and if she leave, I have nothing left. My kids will probably be split and hate their dad because their mom has raised them, my life feels like a joke.\\n\\nI remember when I was in my 20s, I used to be popular with the girls, I had countless opportunities to go out with girls I found more attractive than my wife but I didn’t because I cared for her. In hindsight, I should have just done what I wanted to. Maybe my wife would still be attracted to me, I would be healthier and fitter.\\n\\nIf I had my life all over again, I would not settle down so early, I would date more and find more interesting friends, I would never choose to be a dentist!\\n\\nI should have stuck to my passion for business/physics/teaching/music etc. Even though I would have been broke, I think I would not have cared, I would wake up everyday working towards a better future, work harder because I am not handed money on a silver platter, the list can go on.\\n\\nI feel that it\\'s too late to go back to pursue my passions now, my kids have expectations, my wife has expectations, society thinks that I am useful and important.\\n\\nSorry if this is a long read, but I just had to say it. I truly have made a joke out of the one life I was given by choosing money, stability, safety, other people’s opinions over my real passions.\\n\\nTo all the people stuck between money/stability/safety and passions, just chase your passions because the safe path does not guarantee that you’ll live a life that was worth living.\\n\\nTL:DR – I ruined my life by continuing  to do what I hated – dentistry. It has ruined my marriage, health, family, my passions, my mind. Do what you are passionate about, f\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* societal expectations.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT:  \\nI was not expecting this post to get so much attention as it has, I just posted it as a whim to tell atleast someone about it. I was very emotional at the time and did not proof read anything that I typed.\\n\\nHonestly reading your thoughts, encouragement and most importantly your own personal stories, I feel like I\\'m gaining a new perspective at life and how I can change it, for the first time in a very long time, I feel that maybe this is not the end. I don\\'t have to die a slave to a system that does not support my life or adds any value to my life.\\n\\nI will put down answers to recurring questions below as they come up and keep you guys updated on what I will do with my life in this post. Thank you reddit for giving me hope. **UPDATES BELOW**\\n\\nThrowaway account, this literally happened like an hour ago. So I (M25) have been involved with an older woman (F44) lately. \\n\\nIt started a few months ago with the onset of Coronavirus, I was on Tinder trying to find someone to hook up with during quarantine so as to stay safe and also kill some time. I saw this very attractive older woman and decided to swipe right because you know, it’s every 20-something year olds dream to hook up with a Milf. A few days go by and I get a notification that I have a new match. Wahoo! I open up the app and lo and behold it’s the fine ass cougar I was hoping for. \\n\\nWe start chatting and flirting, it’s going really well. Out of nowhere she messages me and says “I’m not sure how this app works, do we just meet to have sex or do we go on a date first?” I was drinking coffee at the time and promptly shot it out both nostrils. My chance had come. I replied back that people generally just meet up to go to the Bone Zone together but I’m easy either way. She replies “well good because I hate formalities” I nearly shit my pants in excitement. She sends me her address and tells me she’s free on Friday and to bring wine. The rest of that whole week was a complete blur of anxiety. I could not fuck this up. \\n\\nSo Friday comes, I show up with wine, she looks fucking smoking hot. Better in person. We talk about music and travelling and all that, not many personal details (which would come back to haunt me) just sort of arts & culture talk. A few glasses of wine later and were full blown going at it like rabbits on the middle of her living room floor. I left a little while later feeling like I’m the king of the entire universe and go to sleep. \\n\\nThe next day she texts me saying how she had a great time, and it made her feel young again and blah blah blah. She says she’s off every Friday and Saturday and that next week we should do the same. \\n\\nThis has been going on for roughly 3 months, we meet up once or twice a week, fuck like animals, and then go on our merry way until one of us gets horny again. Sweet deal right? Wrong. \\n\\nI messaged her yesterday saying that I had today off of work and asked if she wanted to meet up, she said her son was taking her out to lunch, and that I could come over at 3pm. She had mentioned she had a son before but didn’t go any further and I didn’t really care to ask.\\n\\nSo 3pm comes and I’m almost at her house when she messages me that she’s running late; no problem. I park on the road and sort of just wait in my car because her car wasn’t in the driveway yet. I’m sitting there listening to the radio when an oddly familiar SUV pulls into the drive. I sorta looked at it funny and then I immediately realized where I knew it from. My coworker(M23) jumps out of the front seat, goes around to her side of the vehicle, gives her a kiss on the cheek and a hug and then jumps back in the car. My jaw was on the ground. \\n\\nHe reversed out of the driveway and stupid me is sitting like a deer in the headlights in plain sight. He turns around and is literally 10 feet in front of my car and staring directly at me. My face goes bright red and I feel like I’m going to vomit. Me and this guy work together every single day and I consider him a friend of mine, I even trained him when he started at my company. And the kicker is I’ve been telling him (in detail) about this older lady and he’s been giving me immense kudos about it saying that it’s “his dream”.\\n\\nHe pulls up beside me and looks very confused, asks me what I’m doing and how funny it was we ran into each other. I panic completely and stumble over my words and pretend like I’m on the wrong street and trying to find my cousins house. He looked skeptical but sort of shrugged it off. The whole time his mother is standing there watching us through the curtains. He directs me where to go and I pull off and then circle back once he’s gone. \\n\\nNeedless to say I went inside and told her what was up, and we both sort of sat there in silence before I left. No boom boom today. \\n\\nI am now panicking, there’s no way he’s not going to know right? And he’s gonna realize all these wild escapades with this she devil night mistress I’ve been telling him about is actually his mom? Fuck. I already called in sick for work tomorrow because I cannot look him in the eye. \\n\\nWill update if anything happens. \\n\\nPray for my soul Reddit. \\n\\nUPDATE: she just texted me and says that we should tell him and come clean because it’s the right thing to do. WHAT THE FUCK. How do I politely explain that I’ve told her son in detail about our escapades including the time I dripped candle wax on her butthole? (she a freak) \\n\\nUPDATE 2: she’s adamant about telling him, even after I informed her about the explicit details I’ve been sharing since we started doing this. What is wrong w this woman. I’m seriously debating quitting my job, I know her son well and he’s gonna want to fucking kill me. She keeps insisting that “he’s a grown up and he should realize that his mother is a person too with desires like any other person” THATS NOT THE POINTTTTTT. Fuck. I’m fucked bro’s. \\n\\nUPDATE 3: she said regardless of what I say she’s telling him tomorrow, because she can’t “live with the guilt and deceit” she won’t answer my calls at all. Not going over to her house because she’s out somewhere. I’m fucked, will update again. Let my tombstone read “died doing what he loved best”. \\n\\nUPDATE 4: Well gentleman, the cat is out of the bag. His mother pulled the trigger and came clean about it all. I don’t even know what to say. He called me saying it was super weird and he’s mindfucked but he’s not mad because he knows we had no idea. He asked if it was her I’d been talking about the whole time and I said yes, then he must’ve felt suicidal because he asked “....even all that crazy stuff?” RIP BRO. Needless to say I laughed and changed the subject, you’ve been through enough today my child. \\n\\nHe also said he’s gonna look for a new job & already gave his two weeks notice because it’ll be weird working together. Damn. He genuinely just seems bummed as fuck. His mother is an idiot and I feel scummy as hell. He also said he put in a transfer so we won’t be working in the same building until he’s gone. Jeez. Going to see his Mom later and telling her we can’t do this anymore, she caused him to lose a job and a friend and a reason to go to therapy over something we could’ve likely played off. I think that’s the end of it though, didn’t expect this to blow up so big but thanks for all the awards and comments! At least someone gained something positive from this rollercoaster haha. \\n\\nCan’t believe I made my own son quit his job. Damn. \\n\\nThanks Reddit! \\n\\nTLDR; banging hot older woman for a few months, go to meet with her. Coworker drops her off and I learn that she’s his mother. He sees me waiting and seems skeptical about my lie as to what I was doing. My world crushes. RIP Me.\\n\\nEdit; fix spelling / grammar Obviously a throwaway. \\n\\nTo put things into perspective, I (M 20) and my GF (F 21) had been dating/together for four and a bit years. Typical high school sweethearts, we wanted to move away and start our own lives after college. \\n\\nWe decide to spice things up a bit and “open” up our relationship a little. It was pretty much a join decision but looking back she was kind of insistent on the whole “sex is fun” idea.\\n\\nShe is on a night out with some friends when she phones me and asks if the whole open relationship thing is still cool, explaining she’s met a guy (M 24) and asks for me to pay for a hotel because she wasn’t working at the time. I agreed. I tell her to go for it, and she does. She texts me to say she had a good night and that all was well.\\n\\nThe week after, she mentions she’s meeting up with this guy again. Wasn’t expecting it but I’m cool with it. Again, asks for me to pay for her hotel. A decision I would live to regret. She doesn’t text me the entire night. Weird, but okay maybe she’s just having a good time?\\n\\nThe next day I receive a load of messages about how she needs a “break” from “everything” right now. Meeting this guy has apparently opened her eyes. A little more conversation and we’re over. She’s completely cut me out of her life. I check her snap chat story, and of course, she’s with him. I’ve heard from her friends that they’re dating now. \\n\\nTLDR; Agreed to an open relationship, basically paid for my girlfriend to find someone better and dump me.  TLDR at the bottom- \\n\\nWell I recently started a new job about 5-6 months ago, doing some tech work (trying not to be too specific). With that being said I’m pretty young, 24, definitely the youngest that works there why far. I also mostly work with other men, 30-40. \\n\\nWe have a GroupMe for the store I work at, which includes the owner, the manager and 5-6 other employees.\\nThe previous night I had been feeling a little frisky and desired to take some pictures/videos for the guy that I was with at the time. No biggie right? \\nThe next morning I had work, go in as normal, pretty busy day actually. Noon rolls around and I needed to post a picture to the groupme about a issue I was having with a computer I was working on. \\nI typed what I needed to said clicked the camera roll icon and just as I clicked the picture, a customer came up and started asking me a question, I hit send without thinking and go on about my day. I should also probably say that by this time I was working alone and closing so no one else was around. The customer who came in kept me pretty busy for 30-45 mins, when they finally left I went to check my phone and saw I had a bunch of missed calls from my boss... at first I thought he was just calling me about the question I had, while the phone was ringing, I went back to look at the groupme, to my horror I CLICKED NOT JUST A PICTURE FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE, BUT THE WHOLE DAMN VIDEO. My heart dropped, instantly when I realized what happened my boss picked up the phone, he began questioning me about what my “intentions” where with the video and that he’s never had anyone do such a disrespectful act in the company before. I tried to explain but needless to say that was my last day working there. Lol on the bright side the coworker I had a crush on...finally got his attention. 🤷🏼\\u200d♀️😂 \\n\\n\\nTLDR: tried to send a picture of a customers problem to my employee groupme, turns out I send an entire nude video of myself, still got the guy in the end! \\n\\nEdit: please stop upvoting for the love of godddd\\n\\n\\nEdit: since it stopped climbing, fuck it, here’s the video \\nhttps://imgur.com/a/eJfs0uy My son was born with a condition called Pectus Excavatum. In layman’s terms, his chest is sunken in. His condition was so bad that he only had two and a half inches between his sternum and his spine and his heart and lungs were bruised because of it. In December, he had surgery to correct it and they put two nickel bars in his chest to give it space and train his bones to grow correctly. \\n\\nAbout three weeks after his surgery, a kid punched him and dislodged the top bar and he had to have another surgery to put the bar back in place. The kid has been through a lot. \\n\\nWell, the doctor cleared him for most activity last week, just no skateboarding or bike riding but he could now lift his backpack and go hang out with friends and play pick up, non contact sports. Unbeknownst to me, a kid in his class had been bullying him all semester. And because my son was afraid of getting hit again, he just took it. Well, the evening he was cleared he came to me and said, “Dad, I’m cleared now. A kid has been bullying me and hitting me for months. Can I kick his ass?” Well, my son isn’t really a fighter. He’s fought with his brothers but never anyone else, and he’s always gotten his ass kicked. So I just figured he was just talking. But this is the first I had heard about the bullying and I was concerned. I could tell he was distressed about the situation so I told him to knock the fucker out. He just nodded and went to his room. \\n\\nNow, his older brother is s tough SOB. He had a traumatic brain injury two years ago and he missed a year of school so he’s in the same grade and coincidentally takes the same class. I talked to him about it and told him to handle it but don’t get in trouble. He told me that the kid walks in every day and punches my son in the head. I asked him why he allowed that to happen and he said he wanted his brother to get tough and once he was tired of getting hit, he would do something about it. While I kinda agree with his thinking, I instructed him to handle it without getting in trouble. \\n\\nThe next morning I took them both to school then drove back home to get my younger daughter who goes to a different school that starts later. On the way to take her to school, my wife calls me. “Have you taken xxxxx to school yet? Well, after you do, go pick up your son. He got in a fight.” I just assumed it was my oldest son. Imagine my surprise when I walked into the school office to see my younger son with a grin from ear to ear! He was beaming! He pointed to another kid sitting in a chair holding an ice pack on his face. “I warned him.” I was so proud. \\n\\nHe had walked into class, sat down, and the kid popped him in the head like always. My older son got up to intervene and before he could, my son decked the kid with one punch. He said the kid was bawling on the floor and that it was the best day of his life. He got suspended for three days. \\n\\nTL;DR I gave my son permission to beat up his bully because I didn’t think he would and he did it.\\n\\nEDIT ONE: The kid who punched my son in the chest was one of his friends. It wasn’t malicious. Just two boys clowning around. He was horrified that he had hurt my son. The bully punched my son in the head every day. Once he found out my son couldn’t do anything about it, he just kept on. My son wasn’t the only one he bullied, either. Also, the bully’s brother came to my son later and told him that he had warned him once my son COULD fight, that he was going to get his ass kicked. \\n\\nEDIT TWO: My son has some social anxiety and since the fight he has made a LOT of new friends. He used to hate going to school but now he’s disappointed that school is out for summer. Crazy!\\n\\nEDIT THREE: Thanks for the precious metals! And holy shit! Front page?!?! Last night I finally managed to convince my fianceé to smoke weed with me. She\\'s always been anti-420, but now that we\\'re just a few weeks away from getting married and being all grown up and shit, she\\'s gone full YOLO. \\n\\nFast forward to me seeing my fianceé high for the first time. She became extremely relaxed and talkative. It was cute at first, listening to her go on and on about life and love. But then shit kind of got specific. She mentioned how she never expected to be with someone like me. \\n\\nI didn\\'t even have to encourage her to explain because the floodgates were already wide open. All those details spilled out without any fucking filter. This is what I learned from my fianceé that I never knew before: \\n\\n1. Most of her past relationships ended because she was notoriously promiscuous.\\n\\n2. As per #1: one of those relationships came to an end after she cheated on her boyfriend by hooking up with his younger brother, while also cheating on the damn brother, with his best friend, who just so happened to be the same sex.\\n\\n3. I\\'m the first guy she\\'s had to do the \"fake orgasm thing\" with. Apparently all her exes pushed all the right buttons whereas I don\\'t.\\n\\n4. My asthma is a turn off when it comes to sex because she feels like she needs to hold back, so that I don\\'t get too excited and die.\\n\\n5. All her exes had horse dicks (of course they did!). I\\'m her first average.\\n\\nThose were some of the key points. I was too traumatised to register whatever else she said afterwards. I don\\'t think I blinked for the rest of the evening.\\n\\n**TL:DR Convinced my fianceé to get high on relationship-destroying weed.**\\n\\n*Update: Even though I knew what my fianceé said would haunt me forever, I was willing to bury it in the back of my mind and pretend like last night never even happened. However, my fianceé wanted to talk. So we did. It was brutal. She said my mom was right about her being wrong for me. Long story short, all of this shit was building up to her admitting she\\'d been sending nudes to one of her horse dick exes. A fucking Chad. I\\'m emotionally destroyed. It doesn\\'t feel real yet, so I have trouble accepting it\\'s over. But it is. Guess I\\'m returning that ring and getting a PS5. Appreciate all the advice.* Obligatory this happened a couple of days ago but I’ve only just psychologically recovered from my utter embarrassment.\\n\\nSo. After lockdown ended in my country there’s been a huge sale at my local laser hair removal clinic and so I thought fuck it, I might as well go for it.\\nSo I paid for my 10 visits and set off for the first one, a little nervous but excited for my new, hairless body. Now I decided it would be a great idea to get a full Brazilian, allll the way from front to back. Pretty normal right?\\n\\nThe lovely nurse comes in and gives me a brief heads up, explains how it all works sorta thing. So she leaves the room, leaving me to strip down. She comes back in, and decides that we are going to laser away the hair around my asshole first. All well and good right?\\n\\nSo the instructions I’m given are “lay on your right side, and use your left hand to pull up your bum cheek”\\n\\nSo here I am, lying on my side, hand pulling up my bum while this lady sticks a laser round my asshole. Now, on my left hand, I wear this gorgeous silver ring with a bright blue gem- it was handmade by my best friends boyfriend so it’s pretty unique.\\n\\nSo this lady saw my gorgeous ring, and decided to break the awkward silence with a “that’s a cute ring you have there”.\\n\\nAnd of course, I happened to forget I was wearing the damn ring. It just made sense in my head that this nurse was complimenting the ring of my asshole. Yeah. I know.\\n\\nSo, still on my side, I tell her “thank you! It’ll be a lot nicer when it’s hairless lol”\\n\\nCue awkward laugh and then silence, until I realised that she was not, in fact, talking about my bum. Finished the rest of the appointment without speaking and dashed out of there as soon as possible. Still recovering.\\n\\nTL;DR: my laser hair removal complimented my ring on my finger while doing laser hair removal on my asshole, and I thought she was saying I had a cute asshole\\n\\nEdit: clarity\\n\\nEdit: for everyone asking, this is the [ring](https://imgur.com/uqhSqij). It’s not super intricate but I was more impressed that it was handmade and the stone is pretty imo.\\nFor everyone asking, my friends boyfriend has started a jewellery business and I bought the ring to support them- nothing funny going on there. Happened a couple weeks ago\\n\\nI was at a party and saw a girl across the room. She was wearing a skirt, holding a drink in one hand and had the other hand in her pocket. I saw her skirt, thought to myself how cool that skirt is having pockets. A lot of women I know complain about not having pockets, so this is a very progressive thing.\\n\\nA bit later, I got around to talking to her. I complimented her skirt, and how pockets in a skirt is great. She looked very confused, said “my skirt doesn’t have pockets, why would you think that?” I mentioned that I had seen her earlier with her hand in her pocket. Her face went bright red and revealed that her hand was amputated. What I thought was her hand in her pocket, was her stump resting against her hip.\\n\\nI apologised immediately, but luckily she thought it was funny because she’d never heard that comment before. I’m still dying inside though.\\n\\nTL DR; Complimented a girl on having a skirt with pockets, turns out she just didn’t have a hand. TIFU by saving my reddit log in to the computer at my work. I forgot to deselect the box that remembers my log in information and now my co-worker and anyone who uses the work computer has access to my reddit account and can do whatever they want. In fact, I don\\'t even know I\\'ve FU yet. My co-worker is hoping that I discover that I FU when I receive replies to this post. Reddit, please let me know I\\'ve FU and give my coworker recommendations of how to increase the consequences of staying logged in.\\n\\nTL;DR: I forgot to log out of my reddit and now my co-worker can do what ever they want, like say the true user of this account has a small penis. But it\\'s coming from me so you know it\\'s credible, and that I, u/MisterWhisler_ am not the slightest bit hung. So this TIFU isn\\'t as crazy or wild as others I read, but I thought others would appreciate how much I\\'m laughing but how many horrible regrets I have over this situation.\\n\\nLet me start by saying it\\'s important to note that whenever I cook hotdogs, I slice the package, take out a few, roll the rest back up in the plastic packaging, and fasten it all with some good old fashion elastic bands.\\n\\n.. Today. I did not. \\n\\nI couldn\\'t tell you why my dumb ass decided to just fold the plastic over a few times and place it back on the shelf, but here we are.\\n\\nSo my spouse comes running down in their few minutes between endless meetings to make their lunch quickly. We are the only two in our house, plus our little rescue dog who was a stray and an absolute MOOCH.\\n\\nI mean, this dog will weave between your feet, eyes GLUED to the floor hoping for even a single speck of crum because woe is him he\\'s never been fed a day in his life.\\n\\nSo we\\'re all in the kitchen, I hear the fridge open, and it suddenly dawns on me in horror that my spouse is MOST DEFINITELY going to go for those hotdogs I wrapped like a dumbass.\\n\\nI quickly turn around to say something, and my spouse in slow motion, wide-eyed stares at me as the hotdog package unrolls like a fruit-by-the-foot commerical and DOUSES my dog\\'s entire skull in too-much-to-be-reasonable-in-one-fucking-package of hotdog water.\\n\\nMy dog lost his SHIT.\\n\\nLike a Christian grandma with the second coming of Christ my dog just tears ass across the entire apartment with the worst case of the zoomies I think we\\'ve ever seen him have.\\n\\nHe proceeds to spend the next 15 mins singing our praises as the greatest humans alive as he rolls across every piece of furniture we own.\\n\\nI\\'m talking every. Piece. Of. Furniture.\\n\\nNow I don\\'t hate hotdogs but the smell is weirdly  overpowering, and every time I sat down on something else all I can smell is godforsaken hotdogs.\\n\\nMy dog loves it though. And now I\\'m figuring out how to shampoo out hotdog water from my life. I have so many regrets.\\n\\nTLDR: My dumb ass didn\\'t seal a package of hotdogs properly and my spouse accidentally dumped hotdog water all over my dog\\'s head and now I\\'m living in a hotdog smelling hellhole because my dog decided to excitedly roll on EVERYTHING we own. But at least he\\'s having the best damn day of his life because of it. I probably hate hotdogs now.\\n\\nEdit: Oh my gosh I\\'m trying to go through all the comments! I\\'m so glad so many of you got a good laugh out of this too! I don\\'t know what awards do, but I want to thank you kind folks for being so cool. <3\\n\\nEdit 2: I didn\\'t know how to add the doggo tax so I posted pics in the comments! Not to much to say, really. My girlfriend came to visit and I guess I got distracted. My colleague who is, as mentioned in title, much smarter and more handsome than I am, seized this opportunity with gusto. He realized the shared computer was already logged in to reddit and immediately checked the username.\\n\\n\"Ahh... Justifire989, you have fucked up.\" Immediately he knew where he should post first. Unfortunately, I am a lesser man and not subscribed to [r/TIFU](https://www.reddit.com/r/TIFU/), so he must have had to navigate here before beginning his tirade.\\n\\nHow he must have cackled, laughing at my puny karma score. Nearly 5 years on reddit and all I\\'ve amassed is 485 measly internet points. I imagine he must have checked all my posts and perhaps even read some of my comments. I started to worry... \"Wait...! Have I posted anything embarrassing?!\" As soon as this thought occurred to me I, of course, went to check my comment history, hoping I hadn\\'t commented on anything in [r/furry\\\\_irl](https://www.reddit.com/r/furry_irl/).\\n\\nIt was then that I began to wonder what else he may have done to my account while I was gone. Upon inspection, I found that he had subscribed to several subreddits I never would have subbed to. Who knew that [r/sounding](https://www.reddit.com/r/sounding/) is a thing? NSFW WARNING\\n\\nNow I must begin the process of cleaning up my account. Or perhaps I\\'ll simply discard it and start fresh. I just can\\'t believe that I was dumb enough to let this happen while I was in sitting in the next room. Pray for me reddit, I\\'ve been bested by a better man.\\n\\nTL;DR left my account signed in, colleague messed with me\\n\\nUPDATE: My shift is over now so I\\'m headed out. OP called me a few minutes ago to say \"Well played.\" when he started getting notifications on his phone from r/gayr4r. I feel I\\'ve done good work this night.\\n\\nUPDATE 2: The first update and the post itself was made by my colleague, not the owner of the account. I see a few people are upset by the post that was made in r/gayr4r, but i assure you it was not made with any malicious intent nor was it made by me. Huge thanks to all the people who have given awards btw! I will make sure my colleague is provided with the satisfaction of knowing they did good. Our friends fighting for net neutrality contacted us to ask if we would once more make a stickied post about this topic. Since net neutrality is important for everyone who wants to keep enjoying a free internet - a group to which  most redditors belong - the mod team has decided to allow it:\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHey everyone, the chairman of the FCC is very likely to announce a vote to gut neutrality, possibly as soon as Nov. 22nd. Once a vote is called, it will become much, much harder to stop ISPs from charging us extra fees to access sites like reddit, and controlling what we see and do online by throttling and blocking sites, apps, games, and streaming services.\\n\\nBut there’s still hope. The most effective way to can stop this is by driving as many calls as possible to our Senators and Representatives, now through Nov. 22nd.\\n\\nWe\\'re getting word that there are lawmakers who are sympathetic to our cause and considering taking action to slow the FCC down, but they won’t act unless they get more phone calls from constituents.\\n\\nPlease, head over to https://www.battleforthenet.com   and give your Senators and Reps a call telling them to stop the FCC from slashing Title II net neutrality protections. The time to act is now.\\n\\nWe also have ready-made banners, modals, and graphics of various sizes here: https://www.battleforthenet.com/#join\\n\\nThanks. My friend Jenna moved into a nice, new condo last month and I finally got a chance to check it out for the first time today.  I ended up arriving before she got home from work so she told me to let myself in with the spare key under the potted plant and to make myself comfortable.  \\n\\nI made myself a sandwich and was meandering around eating and checking out her swanky new place when the front door opened and a really large and unfamiliar man with a duffel bag came in.  Dude was intimidating and I\\'m a 4\\'11\" woman so I was immediately scared.  He looked shocked to see me.  I\\'m looking at his duffel bag and realizing that I surprised some piece of shit burglar! \\n\\nI panicked and threw my sandwich at his face and then locked myself in the bedroom.  I\\'m shaking and he pounds on the door yelling at me to get the fuck out.  I start screaming at HIM to get the fuck out and that I\\'m calling the police (total bluff because I didn\\'t have my phone.)  He then yells back that HE is calling the police on ME.  This gives me pause.  At this point, I look around and realize the bedroom I\\'m in definitely appears to be of the male persuasion.  I ask him through the door if he knows Jenna (last name).  He tells me yes, she is his next door neighbor.  WELL.  Apparently, Jenna\\'s neighbor ALSO keeps a spare key under a potted plant.  \\n\\nSo, today I fucked up by letting myself into my friend\\'s neighbor\\'s place, smacking him in the face with his own sandwich and then screaming at him to get the fuck out of his house.  \\n\\nTL;DR Today I fucked up by wasting a sandwich. So, this is gonna be long and one hell of a ride. NSFW or for anyone, really. And I may not be alive much longer, because I’m probably going to be murdered.\\n\\nI’m at the bar the other night, watching the Hall of Fame Game. After it’s over, I go over to charge my phone, and get one last drink before I Uber home. This girl sitting next to me, very attractive. Out of my league. Like wayyy out. I’m just scrolling through memes on my phone. And she asks me \\n\\n“hey! Can I trust you to watch my things and not drug me?”\\n\\n “Uhh what?”\\n\\n “Can you watch my stuff while I go pee and not drug me” \\n\\nto which the bartender said “oh you can trust Greg, he’s really nice”. Annnd this is where the bartender fucked up.\\n\\nGirl comes back from the bathroom, sits back down and started to talk to me. Just random shit. Showed pictures of our dogs to each other. Talked about shows n stuff. Typical ‘meet a girl at a bar’ flirting shit. She asks if I’ve ever seen the show Years and Years. I say “no, but I’ve seen the band perform live”. So she goes on about how great the show is, and how I need to watch it. Asks if I have HBOGO. “Yes because I forgot to cancel my cable after GoT”. So she makes me download the APP, so I could start watching it when I get home. Thanks for the recommendation! I’ll probably check it out never. So a few minutes later, she said\\n\\n “hey do you live close by?” \\n\\n“Yea, like half a mile”\\n\\n “we should go watch the show right now, we can curl up on your couch and watch it together. I have a bottle of whiskey in my car”\\n\\n“Idk, my house is kind of a mess right now”\\n\\n“That’s okay, I have pets too” (or something like that. All I was thinking was that this girl wants to bang at this point)\\n\\n“I mean I guess, but I have to be at work early tomorrow”\\n\\n“That’s okay, I can only stay 30-40 minutes and then I’ll have to go home”\\n“That’s fine” heh, cuz that’s all the time I’ll need! AM I RIGHT, FELLAS??\\n\\nNo. Nononono, this was probably one of the biggest mistakes of my life at this point.\\n\\nIt’s about, 11pm at this point. I think? And mind you, I’ve only been talking this girl for maybe 20 minutes.\\n\\nSo we tab out, get in her car. Which is a stick shift. And I say “oh no shit, I like you even more now! No one drives a stick anymore! I drive one every day!” Which I’m excited about, because at this point I’m thinking to myself “hmm this girl is hot, has tattoos, likes shows I like, and imma bout to get laid”\\n\\nWe talked about driving a stick shift the whole time on the way to my house (this is important, because it wasn’t the first time that this subject came up). Which is just a half mile away. So was a short drive. She parks behind my car, blocking my car in.\\n\\nGo inside, I try to clean up a little bit as she meets and plays with my dog. While I try to get my Chromecast set up on my living room TV. Ya know, to “watch HBOGO”.\\n\\nShe runs outside to her to grab the bottle of whiskey.\\n\\nIt’s fucking Evan Williams.\\n\\nAnd this is the first time where an “oh no” thought crosses my mind.\\n\\nKids, I’ve slept with some strange in my time. I don’t know how or why I get myself into these situations. I honestly feel that I’m a decent looking, charming, sometimes funny, nice person. Sure I troll the fuck out of people on the interwebs, but I do genuinely care about other people. Being nice does pay off, and karma is a real thing. But in this case, I was dead wrong.\\n\\nSo after some talking about random shit. We get the show playing. I couldn’t even tell you what happened in the first few moments of that show, because she gets up grabs me by the hand, and leads me into my bedroom.\\n\\nSex.\\n\\nSo after, we’re just laying there. Pillow talk. Was a good night. I just got laid. She asked if she could stay the night. We’re gonna go to sleep. Everything is cool. I let her know that I have to be at work in a few hours, so I need to get some rest.\\n\\nNow, up to this point in the story, it all sounds like a great night. Pulled off another one night stand. *high fives all around* Right?\\n\\nWrong.\\n\\nI say “that was great we should do this again sometime”\\n\\n“I don’t think so”\\n\\n“What why?”\\n\\n“I don’t think my husband would appreciate that”\\n\\n\\n\\nI am speechless. I don’t think I’ve ever felt my heart skip that many beats ever. Millions of thoughts crossed my mind all at once. Like, how the fuck did I not see this coming. Omg imma home wrecker. I’m probably gonna get shot of he finds out.\\n\\nMe: “Ummmmmmm WHAT? Is this an open relationship? Does he know where you’re at? Like, why didn’t you tell me that?”\\n\\nHer: “idk, does it matter?”\\n\\n“Uh yeah, I’d be pretty pissed if I was him”\\n\\n\\nNow I’ve been cheated on before. And that feeling sucks. I’ve been in a similar situation like, 10 years ago. Where I didn’t know that I was sleeping with someone who had a bf at the time. I had found out a couple days later, and I found him on fb and let him know. He thanked me, and didn’t get mad at me at all. Cheating is the worse thing ever.\\n\\nSo this is where shit starts to hit the fan. I don’t remember the exact conversation, but it went something like this:\\n\\nHer: “we’re getting separated soon”\\n\\nMe: “well you’re still fucking married to him”\\n\\n“Yea but that’s okay”\\n\\n“How is that okay?”\\n\\n“He’s been..... abusive”\\n\\n\\nThere’s a slight pause, then she starts crying. So this is where the sober me starts to kick in. This girl is struggling. She’s in a bad spot. And no one should ever lay a finger on a woman. And now I’m trying to empathize with this trashy Evan Williams drinking bitch. Like I legit felt bad from all the shit that she was telling me.\\n\\nQue the panic attack.\\n\\nShe starts going nuts. Ripping posters off my wall, running around my house butt naked. Knocking shit over. Basically trashing my house.\\n\\nShe asks me to get her medicine out of her purse. Which I do. She takes it. And calms down. (For the most part).\\n\\nNow this is like, 2 or 3 am now. I tell her that we need to go to sleep. Because I have to work in the morning. She tells me “(bartender) was right, you are a really great guy” Btw, Evan Williams isn’t that bad when you’re slightly inebriated and you just had sex with a crazy bitch.\\n\\nWe finally get to sleep around 4? Maybe? I wake up late, she wants round 3. And who doesn’t like morning sex. I’m still kinda drunk at this point, and could give 0 fucks. So I gave her a fuck.\\n\\nAnyways, I need to leave for work. But her car is blocking mine. I tell her that she needs to move hers, but she can’t because she didn’t know where her clothes were. And told me I couldn’t move it because “I didn’t know how to drive it” \\n\\n“Uhh, this is the third time we’ve had this conversation. I drive a stick every day, I can move your car”\\n\\nI move her car. I leave for work. And I just let her stay at my house. I let her stay because one, the shit that she told me about her husband is pretty crazy. Two, I was already running late, and fuck it she’ll probably leave before I get home.\\n\\nA couple hours into my shift, she stops responding to my texts. I get concerned, because I’m starting to sober up, and piecing all this shit together. I came to the conclusion that I should find the husband on fb, and message him, letting him know what happened.... BUT, I see that she had already messaged him. FROM MY FACEBOOK ACCOUNT! My computer was still logged into fb when I left, and I didn’t think to log out or shut it off or anything.\\n\\nI tell my boss about everything that has happened up until this point. He lets me go home. When I get home, I find her still naked in my bed. I get her friend to get her an Uber. And I leave. Oh also had the sex one more time because 🤷\\u200d♂️.\\n\\nGo back to work. Thinking everything is over. That’s the end of that. Wrong again.\\n\\nI get home from work, to find her on my couch wearing one of my shirts. And only that shirt. Like vag all out and everything. This girl is afraid to go home. Which I’m worried about at this point. Because I want her to go somewhere safe. She’s refusing to reach out to any friends and what not.\\n\\nOh yea, she had me find her phone. Which had 40 something messages and 28 missed calls from her husband. And several others from other people.\\n\\nShe hands me $20 to order a pizza. And after we eat the pizza, she’d Uber home. Fuckin bet. I ordered the pizza, and she wanted one last round of the sex before the pizza got there.\\n\\nI kid you not. I’m sitting on one end of the couch, her on the other. And she just opens her legs and says “make it quick”\\n\\nThis bitch has already hit and kicked me, trashed my house, and I’m just ready for her to leave.\\n\\nSex.\\n\\nAfter, we’re just sitting there, and she starts crying again. Asking to go home. And I’m like \\n\\n“I’ll get you an Uber home, but you gotta put pants on”\\n“No”\\n\\n“What do you mean ‘no’? You can’t get in an Uber with your pussy out”\\n\\n“No”\\n\\n\\nSo I gather up all of her belongings and clothes. And try to help her get dressed. To which she refused to allow me to do.\\n\\nMost guys will agree, one of the hottest things ever... That “arch” thing that women do when you’re pulling their panties off is a fucking amazing feeling.\\n\\n#I had the same feeling when I got her panties ON.\\n\\nPizza arrives. I go outside, sign for the pizza n stuff. Come back inside. Panties are off again. God dammit.\\n\\nWe never even opened the pizza box. She’s saying that she wants to go home. But is refusing to get dressed. I’m starting to panic myself. Because I don’t know how I got myself into this situation. But, am me.\\n\\nShe eventually hands me her phone, with the conversation that’s she having with her husband. And I read through the conversation, it’s her sending multiple texts saying “I’m so sorry babe” “idk where I’m at” “come get me”. And him saying “nope sorry” “this is on you” and “call 911”\\n\\nThat last one though. That’s what I did.\\n\\nBefore I called 911, I offered to drive her car back to the bar where we met, because I knew the husband would give her a ride back there. And not to my house. Because now I’m starting to worry about my safety. I don’t want homeboy to show up on my porch with a shotty. But then again she states that “you don’t know how to drive my car” with it being a stick and all. Even though this is 4th or 5th time this was brought up in conversation.\\n\\nI told them that I have an inebriated woman in my house that is refusing to leave, even though she wants to leave. Etc. I tried to call our one mutual friend, (the bartender from the previous night) but she didn’t answer.\\n\\nThe ~20 minutes before the cops arrived were the most awkward 20 minutes of my life. This girl is drunk crying. Trying to get me to go for yet another round. Where at this point, my dick hurts. Also, “girl you need to get dressed, you’re gonna be going home”\\n\\nFinally got her panties back on, I didn’t tell her that I had called the cops. I told her that the Uber was coming. And was trying to get her to put her pants on.\\n\\nCops show up, I go outside. Explain the situation, was kind of freaking out. But I kept my calm. I told them that I was concerned about her safety, because of all the shit that she told me about her husband. But they can’t force her to go anywhere she didn’t want to. She wanted to go home. Officers ask if she was presentable. I pop my head back in the door. She’s still wearing my shirt and her panties. So I’m like “I guess?”, and then I let them in.\\n\\nShe yells “are you fucking serious? You called the cops?” \\n“Uh yea, you didn’t wanna leave. Even though you said you did. Plus your husband said to call 911, so that’s what I did”\\n\\nThe officer said to her “you’re on this man’s property, and he wants you to leave”\\n\\nQue crying and what not.\\n\\nCops ask me to gather all of her stuff. Which I do. Her husband calls her phone, so I accept the call, and then put it up to her face. Tell her to tell him what’s happening. And that she is getting an Uber home. Apparently her card and PayPal was getting declined for the ride. So she couldn’t do it herself. They live like 5 miles away from me, so it was only $8 or something. I live pretty close to downtown, so ordering a Lyft/Uber usually takes 2-3 minutes after calling for one. Once cops tell her that her ride is on the way, and gonna be here within 2 minutes... Girl finally decides to get dressed.\\n\\nI had to help a 30 year old woman put pants on... I could see the officer’s partner struggling to keep a straight face during that ordeal. Lol.\\n\\nAnyways, I hand her hat, keys, bra, shirt (she’s still wearing mine) to the officer. Made sure she had all of her belongings. We get her to walk out of my house to the Uber. But she tried to grab the bottle of Evan Williams. To where I audibly laughed. “I don’t think they’ll let you take that”\\n\\nCops didn’t let her take it. She got in the Uber and she was gone. Policeman handed me the bottle back. Where I say “usually this is the other way around, ha”\\n\\nPo-po leave, I call it a night, and it’s over.\\n\\nFlash forward to today. I get a message from our mutual friend (the bartender) and she’s asking if crazy girls keys are at my house. I was at work at the time. So I wasn’t able to check. But I’m 98% certain I handed those over to the cops. I look for them when I get home. Found nothing.\\n\\nOh, and this girls car is still parked across the street from my house.\\n\\nSo that brings us to now. I haven’t heard anything from her. Or the husband. And I’m not sure if it’s safe for me to go home. But ya. Know what? Fuck it. I’m glad I could share this story with y’all. There might be more to come, but you’ll probably have to read about it in my obituary.\\n\\nThe moral of the story is, drug every girl that asks you not to drug them at a bar. 😂\\n\\nJk don’t do that.\\n\\nAnd don’t stick your dick in crazy.\\n\\nTLDR: Took a girl home who I didn\\'t know was married. She trashed my house.\\n\\nEdit: I’m not gonna change “que” to “cue” because fuck you, deal with my mistakes while I deal with mine.\\n\\nEdit 2: the messages, https://imgur.com/gallery/jju2GIa\\n\\nEdit 3: her car is still there. Can’t get it towed, because it’s on a public street. I’m still alive. I see a lot of you have sent me messages privately. I’ll get to them when I can.\\n\\nEdit 4: FML. I sent her a text saying that she needs to come get her car. No response. Bartender texted me late last night and asked if I used a condom. Which many of you have asked.... And no. I didn\\'t. The girl told me that she was on birth control and that she\\'s allergic to latex. So I think I may have been baby baited.\\n\\nEdit 5: I’m still not dead. Her car is still in front of my across the street neighbor’s house. I just happened to see said neighbor step outside to smoke a cigarette. So I walked across the street to tell her about the circumstances of getting that car towed, since it’s front of their house... This woman is only wearing a bra and either boy shorts or short shorts. And she’s most likely high on meth. Because when I asked her “hey do you wanna get this car that’s in front of your house towed?” She said “no, noooo hehe” I’m like “yea, I’ll talk to y’all tomorrow” just wtf.\\n\\n**UPDATE**\\n\\nI’ve been texting a mutual friend of the couple. Apparently the husband is a really good guy, and this has (probably) happened before. I’m in the works of a TIFUpdate. But I’ll need time for editing screenshots and stuff. I’d like to protect the privacy of those involved, but I’m just too lazy to do it right now. This wasn\\'t today, it was actually Sunday.\\n\\nThe other night my wife and I were getting ready for bed and being kind of flirty. I had to use the restroom, so stayed downstairs while she went up to bed. While I was sitting on the toilet I got a text: \"Bring a bucket and a mop.\"\\n\\nCrap, one of my kids must have thrown up. I finished my toilet biz and went down to the basement to check the cleaning supplies. I found a bucket, but couldn\\'t find a mop. i found one of those squeezy sponge things, but the sponge was missing. Figuring the vomit was probably congealing by this point, I just grabbed the bucket and a bunch of paper towels and ran upstairs.\\n\\nI got to the upstairs bathroom and found no mess. I carried the cleaning supplies down to my kids rooms, but found no vomit. I went to our bedroom and found my wife lying on the bed. She asked what had taken me so long, and I said I couldn\\'t find a mop, and where was the mess?\\n\\nShe started rolling around on the bed laughing. Suddenly I realized \"Bring a bucket and a mop\" was a line from \"WAP (Wet Ass Pussy).\" My wife had been in the mood, and I had spent 15 minutes looking for a mop in the basement. \\n\\nShe was laughing so much that the mood was basically dead. \\n\\nTL;DR: My wife texted me a line from a Cardi B song to tell me she was in the mood. I thought she wanted me to bring cleaning supplies because a kid threw up. I was encouraged to post this here from a comment I made elsewhere, even though it didn’t happen today, or even this decade, so mods please remove if it goes against the rules. It’s a very funny story though.\\n\\n\\nWhen I was young, my brothers and I snuck a copy of San Andreas into the house. We spent days holed up in our basement taking turns playing, and down there my parents didn’t bother us too much. In order to get tons of money for guns (we had yet to figure out my parents’ dialup password so cheats weren’t a thing for us yet), we would go to the strip club and stand on the stage, absorbing the money dudes threw at the women and just let the game sit for 10-20 minutes. We had to be careful though because sometimes the strippers would do a move and bump into CJ and the bouncers would shoot the place up. One day while I was playing my mom yelled down to the basement at us to get ready, we’re going to Pizza Hut. In a stroke of genius, I drove to the GTA strip club, got on the stage, and then turned the TV off and we left. It was to be the heist of the century.\\n\\nMy dad, however, was at church at this time, practicing for a gospel concert he was singing in. He always filmed the practices so he could take notes at home upon playback, and this time was no different. While my mom and brothers and I were still at the Hut, he arrived at home and plugged his camcorder into the VCR. We had just one VCR, and it was connected to the basement TV.\\n\\nBack at the Hut, my mom gets a phone call. She puts her napkin down and slowly looks around the table at us and says ‘ooookay’ a few times into the phone in this really calculating, specific way that she always did when she knew us kids were in trouble before we did. Naturally, it was at this point that we kids knew we were in trouble. For what, though, we didn’t know.\\n\\nAfter a very quiet minivan ride, we get home and my mom says “Boys why don’t we go down to the basement. Your dad wants to show you his gospel practice downstairs.” It was then at THIS point we knew why we were in trouble. So we drag our feet down the stairs, and lo and behold, my dad is sitting on the couch, TV on, a stripper’s polygonal titties swung stiffly back and forth onscreen to En Vogue’s “My Lovin’”, with CJ standing mere inches away, collecting money.\\n\\nMy dad starts in, “boys I don’t even know where to begin. This PlayStation was a blessing to you for Christmas and this is how you repay us? By breaking our trust??” He is holding the controller up now, gesticulating with it. “Here I am, practicing to bring glory to God, and-“ but he was cut off, as he inadvertently squeezed the controller, causing CJ to punch the stripper.\\n\\nMy entire family stands in silence, watching together as the bouncers in the strip club shoot the place up for what seems like an eternity. After the shooting stops, and CJ appears in front of the hospital, I look back and see my mom silently weeping into her hand. I look at my dad as a single tear rolls down his cheek and he prays under his breath. After another eternity of silence, without a word, my dad bends down, disconnects the PlayStation, walks back to the family computer, disconnects it, goes to his car and drives away. For the next four months he kept the PS2 and PC locked in his office at work.\\n\\nIt’s one of my favorite memories of growing up. I miss my brothers.\\n\\nTL;DR: Wasn’t allowed to play GTA growing up, of course got caught playing it, my dad interrupted his own lecture by accidentally punching a stripper and immediately asked for God’s forgiveness.\\n\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks so much for the response, I’m glad I could spread some laughs with this story! I just want to clarify that my parents weren’t crazy at all, so no need to insult them. I love them so much, they just got overzealous and dramatic from time to time. I had a really great childhood with two loving and involved parents who tried really, really hard to live and raise our family by their convictions. It just doesn’t always work out for everyone involved, like in this case, but it made for a great story that we can all laugh about now. I’m very much an atheist and my parents know it, but we still get along great :)\\n\\nEDIT 2: Also my brothers aren’t dead, we’re all just spread out across the country now! I don’t get to see them very much anymore, that’s all!\\n\\nEDIT 3: Alright now I’m not being so nice. I’m an atheist, but all you other atheist weirdos calling my parents crazy are weird. I hesitate to inform people I’m atheist because of houseplants like you. So self-informed on my life because you’re drunk on your own over-inflated, homuncular ideas about spirituality in people’s personal lives, it’s no wonder r/atheism isn’t a default sub anymore. Look how you’re acting, trying to tell me “bro you need to get out of there.” The story is over a decade old, apparently none of you can read! I shouldn’t be surprised at what I’m reading! However, if you do still feel inclined to let the pea that rolls around your empty head, whose sound you mistake for a competent thought, inform you of some truly transcendent comment in which you consider calling my parents whack jobs and nuts, it says way more about you and your small-mindedness in acting like you know better just because you have an internet connection and a lifetime full of trauma on your own. STOP BEING WEIRD NERDS IN THE COMMENTS. I get sleep paralysis. I have for the past few years off and on. Usually every couple of months I’ll get a sleep paralysis dream. I’ve talked to my parents about it before. The fuck up is not that they know.\\n\\nThe fuck up is that I decided to try drawing what I saw over my bed last night. And then sent a picture to my mom.\\n\\nNow, my parents are hella catholic. Like, homeschooled for 6 years and went to church every day catholic. Like, when things go bad in life my dad wholeheartedly believes it’s the devil actively attacking us so we lose our faith. Which explains their reaction when I showed them [this picture](https://imgur.com/gallery/NPknvMj).\\n\\nCue the panicked phone call from my parents who now believe the devil visits me in my sleep. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with them trying to find a bible or a rosary so my mom could sleep without worrying my soul would be stolen. They want me to talk to a priest and get my house blessed and use holy water every time I enter. The next time I visit them, I may end up in an impromptu exorcism. Wish me luck.\\n\\nTL;DR my mom thinks the devil visits me at night Let me preface this off by blaming all of you, the entirety of reddit for desensitizing me, and giving me major trust issues on April fools day.\\n\\nSo here it goes... Yesterday I got a group text from my wifes (sarah) side of the family stating there was an emergency family meeting happening that night over dinner at my mother in laws (Barb) house. \\n\\nI immediately had april fools spidey senses starting to tingle, but we haven\\'t all got together since Christmas so I overlooked it and said we (my wife and I ) were in. \\n\\nWe were the last to arrive and it was pretty somber when we walked in. We all sat down at the table and my wifes brother (Tim) informed the family that his wife (Ashley)  has been having an affair and they are divorcing. The affair was with a long time close family friend (Chris) who lived a block away.\\n\\n\\nChris\\' wife (jen) had caught them when she came home early one day last week and broke the news to my brother in law Tim. \\n\\nBoth families have been friends for years. They live less than a block from each other, they each have been married for 15+ years, have 4 kids right around the same age. Honestly, I have always thought both of them were picture perfect families. Hell, all four of them and their kids were at our house two weeks ago for a bbq. \\n\\nAnyways after airing a lot of dirty laundry, and their plans to divorce, how it could effect future family functions, and opening it up to the group of any questions... there was silence. \\n\\nI broke the silence with laughter and a slow clap. Saying this was the best april fools gag I\\'ve ever seen but I wasn\\'t falling for it. I told Ashley and especially Tim they need to consider going into theater, their performances were top notch and tears seemed genuine. \\n\\nBeing the newest member of the family (my wife and I married 6 months ago) this was probably not the best thing to say in hindsight. I probably should not have said anything. \\n\\nEveryone in the room looked horrified. \\n\\nMy mother in law, who had been crying the entire time, lost all composure. She left the room in hysterics and did not return before we left. \\n\\nTim, just shook his head, and his cheating wife actually let out a brief chuckle before calling me out for being a dumbass for thinking this was a ruse. Then berating me for being so insensitive. \\n\\n\\nThe rest of the family sat in silence shaking their heads as my wife berated me for trying to make a joke out of a serious situation...\\n\\n\\nI am still dumbfounded. In hindsight, I probably should have sat in silence... but I honestly still feel like I was calling out an april fools gag. \\n\\n\\n#tldr\\n\\nMy borther in law\\'s wife has been cheating on him. They told the family they are getting divorced. I broke the awkward silence with a slow clap and laughter saying I\\'m no april fool.\\n\\n*Edit*\\n\\nWow this blew up, thanks for the golds and silver.\\n\\n*Edit 2*\\n\\nI don\\'t think I\\'ll be posting the nest video of this situation anymore. This blew up and I just got multiple texts from my wife telling me I fucked up even more by posting this as she saw it on the front page.... And I didn\\'t change any names \\n\\n*Edit 3.0*\\n\\nOk it\\'s been fun everyone, I may see you all again next week with tifu by making a tifu post about divorce that ultimately lead to my own divorce. \\n\\n*Edit 4.0*\\n\\nUhh this post is getting deleted. It\\'s been fun, just got home from work my wife is pissed.\\n\\n*Edit 5*\\n\\nFinal edit. Fuck it, this could be me making another bad decision in a series of bad decisions, but my wife said to leave the post up. Apparently it further shows her family, (who is also on Reddit) how big of a dumbass I am.\\n\\nThanks for everyone who said I\\'m not the asshole. I may have autism, but I\\'m not an asshole. \\n\\n*Edit 6*\\n\\nOnce again was wrong, /pinnacleclub what up\\n\\nGive me a couple days to sleep on releasing the video. I\\'ve got it, I\\'ve just got to convince my wife to release it.  So this happened about 5 hours ago.\\n\\nSo today I woke up and had really painful cramps due to the deadly woman’s monthly cycle, mixed with some spiced chicken that hadn’t set right in my belly all night. I go to the toilet about 3 times before work this morning but it’s eased off a bit so take tablets, grin and bear it then leave for work. \\n\\nNow my job is a working within the Prison System and escorting prisoners to certain places, including courts. This is where it all went downhill. \\n\\nI had to escort this prisoner over to the witness box and stand next to her (open court) So I do my usual but my tummy has started to really hurt again. I’m trying my absolute best to put off a fart which I know is brewing but can’t hold it much longer. So I do a really silent one and pat myself on the back thinking I had got away with it....\\n\\nThat is until the Prisoner starts coughing and retching and shouting, ‘what the fucks that?!’  I quickly realise what it must be but can’t admit to such a foul, putrid smell so start crinkling my nose as well and gagging. The admin clerk walks slightly closer and retches so hard she had to swiftly put her head in the bin. By this point it’s getting loud and chaos is starting to ensue (not what you want in court, in front of the District Judge) \\n\\nHe quickly tells me to take the prisoner back over to the closed dock and states it must be the pipes. He stands down the whole of court and makes maintenance come in to check all pipes for any leaks, cracks, ANYTHING which could of made that smell happen.  Prisoner still has watery eyes, Im pretending to gag and the clerk is sipping water next to a bucket. \\n\\nTLDR: So yeah, court was stood down for over an hour whilst it was searched for the cause of a smell. Not knowing the cause was back down in the cells, hanging her head in shame and regaling to her co-workers about the ‘leaky pipe’ upstairs. Link to OG post! https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/acyy54/tifu_by_not_knowing_that_the_guy_i_like_works_on/\\n\\nTwo months ago, I fucked up. I was infatuated with this super cute guy who came in and guest lectured for one of my classes. I ended up realizing, not in a way that I wanted to at all, that he actually works three labs down from the lab I work at. \\n\\nBasically, most of the floor was on holiday and my close friend and I were hanging around the hallway joking about my crush on this guy when I said, \"I would even let him fuck me in the ass if he wanted to...\" He overheard, came out and told me and my friend to be quiet, then winked at me. I was so fucking mortified. \\n\\nI didn\\'t come back to to the lab until winter break was over, hoping that the large influx of people would somehow prevent me from ever seeing him again. That didn\\'t happen. On my first day back, I was in the break room making some toast when he walks in. \"Oh fuck,\" I had thought knowing that a confrontation was probably inevitable and that I ought to apologize for my crass comment. But instead, I frantically looked away and focused on putting peanut butter on my toast because if I do that, he can\\'t see me right? That didn\\'t happen again. Instead, he came up right next to me smiled, and said \"Hey [my name], how was your break?\" \\n\\nI looked up awkwardly and told him it was fine, mainly just stayed on campus and worked at the lab. He told me that he basically did the same but went to see his family for a couple of days. He didn\\'t bring up what happened either thank god. Then he said something along the lines of, \"Is that all your having for lunch?\" and I was like, \"Uhm yeah, I was in a rush and forgot to pack something.\" \\n\\nThen he said, \"Oh I was gonna go grab something to eat at [a sandwich place near us], do you wanna come with?\" \\n\\nI was like what the fuck, that smooth fucker. I tried not reading into it and brushed if off as him being nice so I said sure and we went. \\n\\nWell. We ended up having a great lunch. Inevitably as we were on our way back, he finally made a crack and was like, \"So tell me, after our lunch today, how many seconds do you think I spent staring at you?\" I literally just looked at him blankly with my jaw dropped before he chuckled out, \"It has to be longer than six seconds at a time right? That has to mean I like you.\" (Btw what he said was a reference to what me and my friend were talking about that day when he overheard). \\n\\nEven with my shock, I managed to laugh and make a wise crack back at him. \\n\\nWell, tomorrow is our one month anniversary! \\n\\nWe have not done the butt stuff. He told me after a couple weeks that although he appreciated my comment, he\\'s not into putting his dick in buttholes. Looks like I will be retaining my butt virginity and I managed to get a super cute, intelligent, and kind boyfriend out of this whole ordeal.\\n\\nTL;DR: Despite my fuck up, it all worked out. We\\'re celebrating one month together tomorrow! Also, I\\'m a girl (got two comments asking if I was).\\n\\nEdit: Yes, I accidentally wrote \"guess\" instead of \"guest.\" My b, my b.  Obligatory this story actually happened about a year ago: I (18F at the time) was dating a boy named, Jacob (18 M at the time). His father (early 60s) was a mechanic, and his mom (mid 50s) was a SAHM. They were a pretty typical white suburban family in the south and had asked Jacob if they could meet me even though we had only been dating for a month.\\n\\nAt the dinner, I met his mom, dad, older brother, older sister, and her newborn daughter. The dinner went well and I was chatting about my volunteer work at my college\\'s blood drive, to which his father explains that his doctor told him he was O negative and a universal blood donor. My boyfriend mentions he is also O, but his siblings casually mention they are both AB. I don\\'t think anything of it because my bf had mentioned that his mom was married once before and was widowed. The following conversation went like this:\\n\\nMe: Oh that\\'s really cool. You\\'re a really rare blood type. If you don\\'t mind me asking: is your mom\\'s blood type A and your dad\\'s B or your dad\\'s A and mom\\'s B?\\n\\nOS (older sister): What do you mean? He\\'s O. \\\\*Gesturing to my bf\\'s father\\\\*\\n\\nMe: Oh I know. I was just asking about your bio father, but of course, you don\\'t have to answer if you don\\'t want to.\\n\\n\\\\*I notice his mom get really pale, and it was in that moment I realized I fucked up\\\\*\\n\\nOB (older brother): What do you mean bio father?\\n\\nMe: I\\'m sorry. I didn\\'t mean anything by it.\\n\\n\\\\*Jacob\\'s dad got real quiet and looking at his wife\\'s face. He knew instantly. I look over to Jacob who I think was starting to put the full picture of what was happening together\\\\*\\n\\nJacob\\'s dad: Are you saying they\\'re not my biological kids? Because my wife swore up and down in marriage counseling (By \"Marriage Counseling\" they mean with a pastor) that they were my kids and she would never cheat on me. (yeah... turns out she never had any kids from her previous marriage)\\n\\nJacob\\'s Mom: I would never cheat on you. OS and OB are your kids.\\n\\nJacob\\'s Dad: OP, why do you think they\\'re not my kids?\\n\\nI tried to excuse myself because it was very clear the cat was out of the bag, and with a quick google search from my boyfriend he starts cussing out his mom. She starts to sob and apologizes over and over again. And I am forced to explain 9th-grade biology to his father about the fact that the only kids he could have produced were with the blood type: O, A or, B; but absolutely not AB. Jacob was the only one with the possibility of being his son.\\n\\nThey all start screaming at one another. OS eventually leaves because her newborn is screaming too. His mom goes and locks herself in the bedroom. His older brother follows her screaming asking who his real father is. My boyfriend is trying to figure out if his dad still wants to *be* their father. I eventually have a friend come pick me up.\\n\\nYeah... we broke up shortly after but not after figuring out that none of the kids produced from the marriage were his (Edit: They found out via paternity tests, for sure weren\\'t his kids) and they divorced soon after.\\n\\n**TL;DR I accidentally revealed that my boyfriend\\'s mom was unfaithful by pointing out the fact that his older siblings who both had the blood type AB could not have been biologically related to their O negative father**\\n\\nEdit: For those asking how they knew their blood types -- Jacob donated blood for the blood drive at our school. His sister just had a baby so she was probably informed during pregnancy. Jacob\\'s dad was told by his doctor for (probably) underlying medical reasons I don\\'t know (I wasn\\'t ever really close to his family after that for obvious reasons) and I don\\'t know how his brother knew.\\n\\nEdit/PSA: Reading through the comments I have discovered many of you don\\'t know your blood type: **Go find out your blood type! It can save your life in an emergency!** If you are parents find out your children\\'s blood type. If you discover you are not biologically related to one or either of your parents. I am very sorry, but you should still know your blood type and I would suggest some therapy. So this literally just happened 30 mins ago. \\n\\nI would freely and happily admit if I tried this on purpose as a warning to others, but legitimately fucked up here. \\n\\nCame with a couple of friends for the weekend to Amsterdam for a birthday. It’s a great city, pretty to look at and loads of fun. \\n\\nI’m sure most people know the Dutch have decriminalised the use of weed and you can visit ‘coffee shops’ and buy and smoke joints. \\n\\nHad a fun party night last night in town. Went to some coffee shops, got stoned, went to some bars, danced at a club. Had a great night, but only a couple of hours sleep. \\n\\nIn a rush packing this morning, as slept through alarm, I put on last nights jeans on with a joint in plastic tube in pocket (front weird pocket in front of main pocket) left over from last night. Got to airport in reasonable time considering slept through alarm. Rushed towards security when suddenly this hideous sensation of my stomach dropping, like in a falling lift...’did I ditch that joint’?\\n\\nAt this stage my rucksack is going through the scanner and the airport staff are guiding me through a body scanner tube that you stand still in with your hands in the air, whilst something revolves around you. \\n\\n‘Sir, do you have anything in your pockets’ says the customs lady as she steers me towards the body scanner. \\n\\nHoly. Fucking. Shit. What to do? I’m still not 100% at this point if there was a joint in my pocket or not. Do I come clean? No way-too late for that. Got to try and style this out, as pocket might actually be empty. \\n\\nGo to tube, put hands up, get scanned no problem. But, Schiphol Airport as policy, possibly because of weed, frisk everyone as soon as out of scan tube. I’m asked to put my hands in air again as airport guy starts to frisk intensely all over. I’m sweating bullets and my scrambled mind is trying to remember the hazy details of last nights outing-did I smoke that joint??? Airport guys hands pats pocket. I feel object being pressed into hip. FUCK FUCK FUCK. \\n\\n‘Sir, empty your pocket please’? Says airport guy. My partner in the mean time has passed security and is watching on. In slow motion I see the penny drop on his face. I dig into that weird front mini pocket, and pull out a small joint in a plastic tube (as sold in coffee shops) of my pocket. Audible gasps come out of other passengers in queue behind me. I feel my face turning almighty red and feel the room getting a bit spinny. \\n\\nI’m dying inside. I say to pat down guy, ‘oh god. I’m really sorry, I forgot that was in th...’\\n‘HAHA, SURE, SURE - THATS WHAT THEY ALL SAY’! Laughs airport pat down guy loudly. \\n\\nI’m placed to one side. Customs security is called over (was left a nerve shredding 30 mins before he turned up). Just gonna take this moment and opportunity to say-the Dutch are a fucking fabulous bunch of people. \\n\\nCustoms man comes over and takes one look at me quivering/near to tears and says, ‘Don’t worry Sir! Don’t look so scared! You are 20th today and you won’t be last! I’m sorry you have a government at home that is so restrictive, but unfortunately I can’t let you leave Amsterdam with this joint as you will get in trouble at home’. \\n\\nI almost wept with relief. I was made to sign a form to say he’d taken joint off me....and that was it...\\n\\nI’m in a bar in Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam having a drink to steady my nerves. To all you Dutch-bless your hearts. You’re the best. I’m sorry I was a hot mess and added to the problem of being a dumb fucking tourist.\\n\\nTLDR I was a hot mess and genuinely forgot I had a joint in my pocket. Got caught with it. Dutch customs were amazing about it. \\n\\nEdit-spelling (my hands are still shaking)\\n\\nEdit 2, Thanks for the shiny stuff. First awards (on a story about my drug use).  I’m from UK for those asking.. My flights just landed and I made it through UK customs without discovering any other forgotten drugs. I’ve just found the docket the nice customs man handed me when he took the weed. It says under what was taken, ‘joints’. \\n\\nEdit 3-Schiphol doesn’t frisk as matter of routine, yes I get it. Thanks for correction.  About three weeks ago, I began preparations to get a nice gift for my bf, who I\\'ll call \"Ray,\" to celebrate 4 years of dating.\\n\\nWe live in a terribly humid place, and all summer he\\'s been complaining about how sweaty his ass and balls get whenever he goes outside. He\\'s been buying the same brand of cotton boxer-briefs since we started dating. I thought it would be a nice homage to our great relationship, a great way to take care of the butt I get to squeeze on the regular, to splurge on a mail subscription service to some silky micromodal underwear. They are pricey but known for being wicking, cooling, and overall very nice on the buns and balls.\\n\\nI ordered the first pair to present to him on the day of, and set up for a pair to be delivered monthly thereafter. I used his email on the sign-up so that I could simply pass on the account to him after the first pair came; that way, he\\'d have full power to pick his colors and style every month, and easily return any if there were unexpected problems.\\n\\nOne small problem: the receipt for this whole transaction is now resting in his email where he can find it and spoil my surprise. I sneakily hacked into his computer while he was out (by which I mean I entered the password he\\'s shared with me, because he foolishly trusted me not to wreck his shit) and opened up his email. I simply archived the existing emails and set it up so that future emails from the company would be auto-marked as read and archived as well. I know how to do this because I\\'m a brilliant hacker (I googled it).\\n\\nWhile carefully double checking my devious work- just to ensure nothing slipped through the cracks- a new email pinged on arrival and caught my attention: A SHIPPING CONFIRMATION FOR AN ENGAGEMENT RING. I immediately noped off his computer, and of course I didn\\'t open the email, but the damage is done. Secret\\'s out!\\n\\nMy heart fell right through my butt, you guys. I actually died and now I\\'m a ghost writing this.\\n\\nI probably should have pretended I never saw that, and taken the secret to my grave, but I was too pumped and couldn\\'t keep it in. Within the hour I broke down and called Ray to sheepishly confess what I had done. He wasn\\'t angry, but sadly disappointed that I spoiled the surprise. \\n\\nHere\\'s the kicker: he didn\\'t actually propose yet, and still intends to make a thing out of it.\\n\\nMy punishment for snooping is that the suspense is KILLING ME. I\\'ve been forbidden from telling anyone that we\\'re getting engaged until it\\'s officiated. Every time we go out, the suspense that this may be the night drives me crazy!\\n\\nA romantic date at the beach the other evening ended with me saying \"damn, I thought for sure we were getting engaged tonight.\"\\n\\n\"Why would you think that I\\'m going to propose to you?\" He said. \"That sounds like something you wouldn\\'t know about because I\\'d keep it secret IN MY PERSONAL EMAIL!\"\\n\\nNow he\\'s started intermittently faking me out. The other day, he walked into the kitchen and presented me with a little hinged box, which turned out to contain a tie pin from his work. He keeps getting down on one knee... Looking up at me... And saying, \"Gotta tie this shoe!\" The emotional stress of keeping this exciting secret within me, not sharing it with coworkers or family or anyone, is MADDENING. Every false start sends my heart right back into my butt.\\n\\nOne more thing: I somehow fucked up the email settings. The shipping confirmation for the underwear didn\\'t get archived on arrival, and he saw it within a few hours. So that surprise got spoiled, too. Turns out I\\'m not a master hacker, and my attempts have only brought woe into this house.\\n\\nI guess it\\'s not all bad: he reports that the pair of boxer-briefs that arrived are very nice to wear, and I do indeed enjoy squeezing his buns in them.\\n\\nIf we ever do actually get married it\\'ll be nice to be hitched to a guy with sweet, silky buns and balls.\\n \\n(Edit-a misspelling)\\n\\n\\nTL;DR tried to hide an email receipt for some fancy underoos, found out about an incoming engagement ring, now I\\'ll never get a husband This was a few years ago.  Took the family to Ginnie Springs, a beautiful Florida water spot for a day of swimming and a little picnic.  So as I was swimming in the crystal clear water, watching my son floundering around in his water wings, and just having a good ol time, my son suddenly stopped, pointed at the water and said \"Look daddy, a lizard!\"\\n\\nI looked over and saw that no, it was NOT a lizard that was swimming over to us, it was a snake. After a quick examination, I realized that this was a Water Moccasin, and a large one at that, heading right for us!\\n\\nSo Yelling for my son to back away, I waded out to grab him and drag him back to shore. The snake was making a beeline for us, which is weird because most of the time they avoid human contact. I started to splash water at it, trying to slow it down enough so I could reach the shore before it got too close. \\n\\nSo as I was backing up, slapping water at a poisonous snake with one hand and dragging a laughing child (who had no idea what was going on) with the other, I reached close enough to the shoreline to grab a branch that had fallen from a tree. It was long and pretty sturdy. It was perfect for what needed to be done.\\n\\nSo as the snake got in close, I went all caveman on it and bashed it a dozen times with the branch. It worked. The snake started to float away, dead as a doornail. I then realized that all the people swimming around in this water would not take too kindly to bumping into a four foot dead moccasin, so using the branch, I launched the snake for a stretch of woods off to my right.\\n\\nWell, I guess the snake was not balanced right on the branch, and I was full of Adrenalin, so instead of the woods, the snake flew high into the air, drifting off to the right where **PLOP**. It landed square on a picnic table.  To make matters worse, it landed on a pile of shoes that a girl scout troop had left when they went wading in the water.\\n\\n\"Oh Crap!\" was all i could think, as I began to quickly swim across the spring to remove the snake from the table, but as I was swimming, I heard them.. the giggles and laughter of little 12 year old girls returning to get their shoes. I stopped cold. I was too late. I began to swim away, trying to hide myself as I saw the first curly haired head approach the table. There was laughing, there was chatting and talking... then there was a pause.\\n\\nAnd that is when the screaming started.\\n\\nIf you have never heard a dozen 12 year old girls scream in horror as they saw a large, bloody snake draped across their shoes, I cannot even begin to explain the sound. Even as i dove underwater, I heard the screaming. \\n\\nSometimes... at night... I still hear the screams.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR- Killed a snake, launched it with a stick across a table filled with 12 year old girls shoes. the screams... they still echo in those woods to this very day. Today Reddit was blocked in Russia, and I am the one who posted [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/rudrugs/comments/1derq9/%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D0%B8_%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9_%D0%BC%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B4_%D0%B2%D1%8B%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%89%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%BF%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B1%D1%8B/) which lead to this.\\n\\nIn Russia, there is a law which allow Roskomnadzor, Russian censorship agency, to block any website without court rulling. Two years ago I tested how RKN react to abuse on popular websites/crazy abuses. On of that websites was Reddit.\\n\\nOne thing I learned is that RKN doesn\\'t want to block popular websites. They respond me that this content is illegal and they blocked it, but they weren\\'t. [It was on 05/21/2013](https://img.bi/#/VN0xdFz!SUfwaAZuQ0OgFP6nJQpMgqpwENsQfA4KLn1gdqhZ). On 10st Aug 2015 they posted [a call to help them contact Reddit administration](https://vk.com/wall-76229642_54727) to official VK page. Funny thing, but they called Psilocybe a plant. Several hours ago they [reported that Reddit is blocked in Russia](https://vk.com/wall-76229642_55304). Seems like things changed.\\n\\nHow Reddit is blocked? Fully. As Reddit switched to HTTPS, there is no way to block special page.\\n\\nWill I remove this post? No. I also think that Reddit administration needs to do nothing. This is important issue on freedom of speech, and only RKN want to violate it.\\n\\nBTW, this post is a guide for indoor growing Psilocybe mushrooms in Russian. I\\'m not sure if any people saw this before blocking, but if you are here and you can read Russian, now you know to grow some shrooms, thanks to RKN.\\n\\nUPD: [Russia unbans Reddit](https://meduza.io/en/news/2015/08/13/russia-unblocks-reddit) as they comply with request and blocked that post for Russian users.\\n\\nUPD2: [This is how Russian Internet censorship works](https://meduza.io/en/feature/2015/08/13/this-is-how-russian-internet-censorship-works) So this happened yesterday... my family (wife, kids and in-laws) and I had just returned from a pontoon cruise for the evening.  It was later than usual so I sent the wife up on the golf cart with the kids and in-laws to get them some dinner while I covered up the boat.  About halfway through covering up the boat, I notice someone halfway across the cove in the water all on their own and she appeared to maybe be in distress.  She wasn’t making progress swimming one way or the other and occasionally going underwater.  There were people on the opposite shoreline yelling at her but I couldn’t tell what they were saying. I yell asking if she needs help and she says yes.  I call my wife and tell her to come down on the cart, someone is in the water and needs help, I’m going in. I might need help getting the person out. I put on a life jacket and grab the throw cushion from the boat.  I swim out to the person and pass off the throw cushion.  She appears out of breath.  First thing she says to me is “I’m topless”.  I responsd with “umm ok, but are you okay?”. \\nI also immediately think to myself:\\n1. My friends are never going to believe this\\n2. What is my wife going to think with a topless woman swimming to shore with me\\n\\n She then says she’s running from her boyfriend who is “messed up”.  She also asks if it’s shallow enough to touch yet.  It wasn’t going to be. I help her to the dock where my wife meets us.  She tells my wife “I’m sorry but I don’t have a shirt on”.  Again my wife just asks if she’s okay and she tells us the boyfriend story again.  Sure enough as she gets out of the water she is topless.  But she is carrying a white Tshirt that she quickly throws on. She then immediately begins running to shore.  At the same time we notice a pontoon cruising towards our dock yelling at us.  At first I think this must be her boyfriend chasing her and we are in the middle of some domestic dispute.  They quickly get closer and I realize it’s two sheriff deputies who flagged a pontoon down to carry them across the lake.  As they are jumping onto the dock we notice the girl had just jumped into our golf cart and was riding away on it.   Apparently she was allegedly involved in a string of burglaries and the “boyfriend” she was running away from was the cops.  I had unknowingly aided her swim across the lake to escape and she used our golf cart as getaway. The cops chased her for awhile through the night tracking her down once more but she escaped again.  We looked all day for the golf cart today with no luck.  I notified insurance if the theft around lunch. About an hour ago someone notified us through social media that it was parked behind a house in a neighborhood over.  So we recovered the cart and it seems ok.  They put more warrants out for the suspect and are still looking for her.\\n\\nTLDR: thought I was saving a topless woman in distress but unknowingly aided a crook in escaping the police. My family loves to over share. This lack of filter sometimes has the tendency to get people into trouble because not all the information is provided, even when it\\'s meant harmlessly. \\n\\nMy parents are a bit older (prime \"Ok, Boomer\" age). I was talking to my Dad the other day on the phone because his birthday dinner was a few days later. I asked how mom was doing and he goes on to tell me a story how my Mom and Aunt (Karen) were at the store and the cashier made a mistake. My Aunt went off on the cashier and asked to see the manager. My Mom was mortified and tried to calm her down but she wasn\\'t having it. \\n\\nI then mentioned to my Dad, \"That\\'s such a Karen thing.\" He goes on to say \"Yeah, your Aunt does that a lot.\" I tell him, \"That\\'s the funny part, the Karen meme is a real thing. It\\'s when an entitled (typically white) woman gets angry at the smallest mistake and asks for the manager.\" \\n\\nMy Dad found this hilarious and I explain in more detail. I send him a few links to sites explaining it online. He finds all of this hilarious and she even has the Karen hairstyle. This sends him down the google images rabbit hole and the next few days he sends me random meme\\'s of \"Karens\" doing Karen stuff adding \"Your Aunt did this last week\" or \"I think this one is about your Aunt.\" This leads up to his birthday dinner with extended family. \\n\\nMy Dad\\'s birthday dinner is going well. Everyone is having a good time, good food, and drinks, etc. Suddenly my Aunt (sitting a few seats down from me) leans forward and loudly shouts down the table \"Hey [my name], what\\'s this whole thing about making a meme about me?\" I respond \"Huh?\" She then tells me my Dad sent her all these memes about things she\\'s done. He didn\\'t give her the context that it\\'s a generic meme from the internet and what it\\'s about. Now, my Aunt thinks I made all these memes about her real life events.\\n\\nAt this point, the entire family thinks I created this meme on the internet about my Aunt\\'s antics in public. There is a back and forth discussion about it being really rude of me. She\\'s pulling a Karen and starts chewing me out. Meanwhile, I am looking at my Dad like W-T-F, back me up here. My Dad finally steps in to say that this is just a random viral internet thing and that I didn\\'t make these up behind my Aunt\\'s back. \\n\\nEven after explaining, she\\'s a bit irritated. It is apparent she is embarrassed that she is so much like a \"Karen\" and couldn\\'t tell the difference between the stories online and her own encounters. \\n \\nTL;DR: I told my Dad about the Karen meme because my Aunt is named Karen and acts like a \"Karen.\" My Dad sends my Aunt memes he found, my aunt think I made them about her, she bring it up at my Dad\\'s birthday dinner, and pulls a Karen on me.\\n\\nedit: redundant sentence This literally just happened and I\\'ve decided to lock myself in my room until further notice.\\n\\nI was surfing through my newsfeed this morning and I happened to see news articles that Jeffrey Epstein (rot in hell) has committed suicide. Now, my family and I all talk about current events and politics. My parents were up and about getting ready for the day, so I figure I\\'ll go tell them the news.\\n\\nTheir door was cracked open, so there\\'s the fuck up. I walk in and am greeted by the sight of my mother blowing my dad. As I hear my mom say \"Do ya mind??\", I immediately walk the other way, and back downstairs to my room. All the while trying to burn away what I just saw.\\n\\nThey leave for the weekend at noon, and I have no plans on seeing them again this morning.\\n\\nTL;DR: Jeff Epstein decided to scar me from beyond the grave.\\n\\nEdit: In one hour on a throwaway, I get more karma than my 4 year old account, first time getting silver, and front page for the first time? Huh.\\n\\nAnyway, back on the \"Fuck Jeff Epstein\" train. My girlfriend and I were laying down on our bed and watching funny videos on YouTube.\\n\\nShe was laughing hysterically at quite a few! So much so that it caused her to let one rip (fart) more than once.\\n\\nThis was obviously not intentional which made it both hilarious and adorable. After the third time it happened she said  “I’m really gassy”. I took this as an opportunity to quickly press down on her stomach which then almost immediately triggered an enormous fart.\\n\\nI lost it! It was so funny and I could feel the vibration as the pressure caused her to fart again and again. I couldn’t help myself and kept doing it. \\n\\nThis is how I f**ked up.\\n\\nAfter a few successful attempts I tried for a final push. I wanted to end it on a huge one. It was so funny and she was laughing so much!!\\n\\nI pushed down and nothing. So.. I pushed again but this time MUCH harder... \\n\\nNow this is where I should note that she was wearing nothing but one of my T-shirt’s. Hence she had no underwear on.\\n\\nMy girlfriend sharted. She sharted and then had a SEVERE follow through... all over our bed.\\n\\nShe was mortified. It went from pure joy to absolute chaos and horror... she was just staring at me blankly like she had just killed someone..\\n\\nI didn’t know what to do as she went quiet.. my legs covered in shit..I stared right back, gently held her hands and walked together to the shower without looking back at the bed or down at my legs.. we didn’t say a word.\\n\\nI cleaned up my legs before leaving her to clean herself up. She made me promise not to go into the bedroom.\\n\\nI adore her completely. She looked so scared when I left her in the shower and wouldn’t let me clean up despite my offering to do so.\\n\\nEventually, I walked in the bedroom to help. She was so apologetic although I assured her that it’s completely fine.\\n\\nShe burst out laughing when I said to her “Don’t worry. You will always be my little shit”.\\n\\nDon’t worry guys. All good! Luckily I have thick skin and can take a lot of shit ;) I adore her. \\n\\n\\nTL;DR - Pushed my girlfriend to hard for shits and giggles. Ended up getting more shit than giggles! Floor 8 of the of place my employment, inside the mens\\' shitter.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'m sitting there, doing my sit-down-business because boss makes a dollar, I make a dime. I\\'ve just finished the dirty work and I\\'m about to perform my ablutions, but I delay it because it\\'s a \"paid to shit\" thing, dicking around on reddit a bit. At this point I feel something jump onto my balls. Something I had never hoped I would ever experience, let alone talk about on the internet.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI shriek. Not a barbarian shriek. Not a viking shriek. Psycho-Shower-Scene shriek.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nA huntsman spider has crawled out of the toilet bowl and jumped onto my low hanging fruit.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI bat the spider off, smacking myself in the nuts, keel over in pain.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSpider dead. Good news.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy banshee wail has not gone unanswered. Bad news.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSomeone comes into the bathroom and knocks on the stall door. \"Mate are you alright? Have you fallen over? I\\'ll call an ambulance.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"NO. FINE. EVERYTHING. IS. GOOD. JUST SLIPPED. FINE. NO NEED TO CALL AN AMBULANCE. YOU CAN LEAVE NOW.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI flush the world\\'s smallest sexual predator to try and retain some of my inner pride, wash my hands, and make the very VERY long walk back to my desk.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy manager\\'s desk isn\\'t too far from the bathrooms, and he comes up to me afterwards.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"What happened in there, is everyone alright?\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"Yeah... Everyone\\'s... FINE.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnd then I make the dumbest deciscion of my life, and explain to him what had happened. And the audacity of the man; he LAUGHS. He laughs so hard he has to sit down so he doesn\\'t hurt himself.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHis hyena/kookaburra hybrid laughter has gotten the attention of some of the other members of my team. They\\'re looking to get in on the funny, funny joke.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBossman wheezes \"GET... GET HIM TO... TELL THEM HOLY SHIT\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnd because I\\'m incredibly susceptible to peer pressure, I tell them. Like a fucking gimp.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'m gonna skip past most of the laughter because it went on for what felt like forever.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI come back from lunch, and Bossman and two other members of my team come up to me as I\\'m sitting back down at my desk getting ready to get back to work. Bossman is holding a piece of paper.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"Look. We need to have a chat about something. I\\'ve brought two of your friends in the team as support since this is obviously not something that\\'s easy to talk about.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI am confused.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"I have a blank HR report here. I\\'ll need you to fill this out. You confided into me that you were sexually harassed in the workplace and it\\'s my duty of care to make sure the \\'POOPITRATOR\\' is brought to justice. Under the space where it says \\'which hand did they assault you with\\', just put x8. We understand this is a traumatic experience for you and I just want you to know that every resource we have is here for you.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR I need to fake my own death because I screamed when a spider jumped on my balls while I was on the toilet. **TL;DR: Tinder date ambushed me in the bathroom and had never seen an uncircumcised penis before, screamed, and the cops were called.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHappened 30 minutes ago. So very much today.\\n\\nThis has been a rough stretch for my love life. This year I said good bye to someone I thought I was going to marry that I was with for 6 years. Immediately after, I found out my mom was categorized as \"high risk\" so I had to move back home to take care of her. I\\'m turning 35 next month, going blind, and I mean, I\\'m an okay looking dude, but I started quarantine maybe a solid 6, but definitely due to depression and the availability and ease of cake and pizza I\\'m down to a 4.\\n\\nI\\'m on all the apps and sites. I try to be funny but frankly, I\\'m depressed as shit and suicidal most days, but thankfully my anxiety is so bad that I probably won\\'t ever do anything about it. So thanks brain, I guess. And this is how it\\'s gone:  \\n\\n\\nTinder: lots of matches, almost entirely bots and people trying to get me to buy their onlyfans. I\\'ve met a few really nice girls but they ended up \"just wanting to chat,\" which is fair and I\\'m happy to have company, but I\\'m also out to date.  \\n\\n\\nBumble: A few matches, but none went anywhere. Lots of tumblr witches.  \\n\\n\\nHinge, OKCupid, Plenty of Fish: Lots of married women. No thanks.  \\n\\n\\nAt this point, it\\'s been two years since I\\'ve had sex, I haven\\'t seen a boob this year, and I\\'ve never been blown. I even looked into an escort with disastrous results, the sharing of which still gets me called a simp every few days. Fair enough.  \\n\\n\\nSo yeah, I\\'m willing to overlook a few red flags if it means I get a little attention. Enter my newest Tinder match. We\\'ll call her Shawna since she looked like one I knew in high school and that isn\\'t even close to her name.\\n\\nInspired by something I saw on I think mademesmile about a dude showing a girl his Gundam collection, her profile was about how much she loves comics. Well, I do too, so I offered to show her my Bane collection! And it worked! The conversations were great, they weren\\'t one sided, and she was actually attracted to me. Which, wow. Okay, didn\\'t see that coming. However, there were a few red flags. Most of her anecdotes that she offered for no reason were about how every guy she ever dated went crazy after knowing her, starting at age 7 (she\\'s 29 now). Which, okay. We all think our exes are crazy, right? I mean I don\\'t. I can\\'t name many people that do. But okay, some do! But then one night I\\'m greeted with \"Last night you stopped talking to me at 11. Usually, it\\'s closer to 11:10. Do you find me boring? Am I not interesting enough for you? Are you the type of guy that needs to talk to a hundred different women? :( :( :( :( :(\" Uh. Well, I\\'m a creature of habit because I\\'m an insomniac, so I try to get ready for bed at the same time and wake up at the same time every day in an effort to not make my sleep schedule donkey punch my depression even worse than it already does. Needless to say, I\\'m a little squicked, but at this point... it\\'s a very attractive woman who says she wants to meet up and has advised me to bring condoms, I\\'m going to ignore enough red flags to power a communist navy.  \\n\\n\\nShe wants to meet at my place, which I told her no, she knows I take care of my mom and even though we\\'re in different parts of the house, \"Hey ma, this is Shawna from tinder, I\\'m going to break a dry spell in the other room. See you in about 3 seconds\" isn\\'t great. Plus I\\'d rather meet a new person in public, such that it is, and though our options are limited, I\\'ve got a park up the street and we can get food delivered. She agreed to the compromise... and in person she was absolutely great. Mostly. She was funny, she found me funny. We walked in the park and just talked about life for hours. A few of the flags were coming back--most notably that her go to \"I\\'m out of things to talk about\" filler was how badly her exes still want to fuck her and some she would consider, but she\\'s afraid they\\'d steal her dog. Direct quote. But you know, *otherwise* she\\'s really nice and she keeps feeling up my leg, and I find my leg gross. So my penis is now firmly in control of the decision making process.\\n\\nThen, providence. Something I didn\\'t think would be a factor at age 34. But fine, it is. My mom, a shut-in who hates everyone, who is vulnerable and never wants to leave the house, decided to go to someone within her work bubble\\'s house. I quickly invite Shawna over, she quickly accepts. One of the cats likes her, one hisses. She sits down on the couch and puts on The Mandalorian, which... alright, I was hoping this is the lay, not the way, but good choice. I excuse myself to the bathroom because now that I\\'m close to a familiar bathroom, my *god* do I have to pee.\\n\\nAnd here\\'s where it starts to fall apart.\\n\\nSo, I\\'m not circumcised. When I pee, especially if someone is going to be interacting with my penis soon, I take a little extra time to wash it off with some warm water, a baby wipe or something. So far okay.\\n\\nBut I fucked up in two places.\\n\\nFirst, I\\'m wearing tan pants. I hate tan pants. I\\'m always paranoid that I\\'ll look like I pissed myself, so I always take *just a minute* longer to make sure everything is very dry before it gets put away.\\n\\nSecond, I didn\\'t lock the door. Normally, this is a big \"WHY DIDN\\'T YOU LOCK THE DOOR\" and yeah, in the future I will, but with the layout of my house, there\\'s a front bathroom and a back bathroom. The front bathroom is right by the living room, the back bathroom is down the hall, through the master bedroom, and tucked away. I used the back bathroom because I am the type of guy that doesn\\'t want to risk bathroom sounds on a first date. So I figured I didn\\'t need to lock it because she\\'d have to cross the house to come get me and I\\'d only be 2 minutes.\\n\\nI finish up peeing and head to the sink. The second I\\'m done, I get *rock hard*. I have no idea how or why, it just happened. I haven\\'t had a woman pay attention to me like this in forever and no matter what I do, I can\\'t calm down. I did the \"flex your thigh trick.\" Nothing. I thought of sad things, I thought of gross things. Nothing. So I just rolled with it, got to washing, started drying, and I heard my bedroom door open. I knew the bathroom wasn\\'t locked, so I quickly try to put it away but my tan pants are also fairly tight, so at this point, the best I can do is turn a bit and try to hide myself while I calm down enough to put it away.\\n\\nShawna opens the door. \"You\\'ve been gone FOREVER. What are you doing?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m just cleaning up. I\\'ll be right out. Just need a couple of seconds.\"\\n\\n\"No, you invited me back here, I\\'m watching a dumb fucking TV show and you\\'re in the bathroom for half an hour (it had legitimately been two minutes or less) and now you\\'ve got your back to me like some kind of a weirdo. What are you doing?\" She crosses the room and turns me around and yep. Still rock hard. Now I figure I can own it, I can say nothing, I can apologize, or--\\n\\nShe begins to scream.\\n\\nI\\'m now trying to turn away from her and put it away as quickly as I can, but she\\'s holding me still and just staring at it like some sort of lab specimen. Thankfully, this is helping my boner go away.\\n\\nShe screams *more.*\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know what you want! What can I do?\"\\n\\n\"What the FUCK is wrong with your dick?\"\\n\\n\"...what?\"\\n\\n\"Are you inbred or something? What the fuck?\"\\n\\nNo more help needed, I gently start to zip up, but she grabbed it, looked at it, and screamed again. And I mean... bloody murder scream. \"Have... have you not seen an uncircumcised dick? This is what dicks look like with foreskin.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s not natural! You\\'re a fucking freak!\"\\n\\nI started to talk about it technically being natural, but she sprinted out of my house.\\n\\nNot the end. My neighbors are all quiet and heard a woman scream five times. The police got called and came right out to my apartment. I told them what happened, they didn\\'t *really* believe me and spent about an hour, hour and a half going room to room, looking for any sign of anything gone wrong. By the time they were done, they were all laughing about taking a statement about an uncircumcised dick scaring someone, advised me to write this down somewhere in case she wants to say I exposed myself to her (I have my doubts since we appear to have blocked each other on everything) and I\\'m here feeling just as depressed as I started only also feeling gross. Yay!\\n\\nEdit: Alright y\\'all. I woke up and took a shower and have over 900 notifications. I can\\'t keep up anymore so I just want to say a few things.\\n\\n1. The most important: if you have foreskin and you have body image issues, read the comments. You will feel amazing. I know I do.\\n\\n2. Depression is an every day battle. Most days I don\\'t feel any hope for a decent future but not enough to be unwilling to see if this is all worth it. If you are reading this and having problems like I have, reach out. My inbox is full of people making sure I\\'m alive. People care about you, even ones you don\\'t know.\\n\\n3. Yes. This happened. I tried to tell it in an amusing way because I\\'m trying to be a writer and I like writing the way my brain narrates things. At the end of the day, when I started writing this post, I felt awful. I miss feeling sexy and desired and I already have body issues, so in the moment, things were monumentally worse. I didn\\'t want to date again, talking to women was a waste of time for a guy like me... those were my toxic inner thoughts about myself. Thanks to the kind folks in this thread and in my inbox, I can already laugh at this story. I don\\'t know how quickly I\\'ll get back out there but I\\'ll definitely find someone... let\\'s be kind and say \"more compatible.\" You are great people to take time to make sure I\\'m okay. I don\\'t know that I am, but I\\'m here and still fighting and I will be. <3 Girlfriend was about to take a shower, and was seriously getting her hustle on getting out of her kit. She was making proper fucking haste for the tub, and I realised that all her defences were down.\\n\\nNote: in my household, bare asses are hunted down and terminated with EXTREME prejudice.\\n\\nI went for the Mother of All Ass Slaps. It was completely undefended territory, and I was intending to create a masterpiece. I was aiming for that initial dull *thwack* and the resultant perfect, satisfying vibrato, complete with concentric assflesh ripples *à la* that glass of water in Jurassic Park.\\n\\nI made contact, and immediately discovered the reason for her hurry.\\n\\nMy girlfriend was on the second day of her period.\\n\\nI learned the term ‘arterial spray’ from Dexter, and have now found its southern companion. I was reeling. She was reeling. Did I say ‘Bloody Mary’ three times in the mirror before spanking dat ass? I couldn’t remember. Fortunately, its trajectory as such was so that most of the menstruation creation spattered handily in the bathtub – including The Clot: a penny-sized curd of uterine lining best visually described as Gumby’s aborted cousin.\\n\\nUnfortunately, our bathmat did not escape entirely unharmed. Its cleaning was immediately and firmly relegated to ‘boyfriend work’.\\n\\nBy the way, has anyone seen The Thing (1982)? Good movie.\\n\\nTl;dr: slapped dat ass as my girlfriend made a beeline for the shower; blood. So much blood. So there\\'s this girl I like at work, and we\\'re really good friends. We\\'re having lunch and we\\'re making those ironic depression meme jokes as most friends do. For some reason I (in my unknowingly- stupid way to get her laugh) got the idea to say \"Well hey, you know what\\'s just one letter away from sad? DAB!\" and promptly did the deed. Also I have ability to cry on demand so I just stared stone-cold her and let two tears fall down.\\n\\nShe finds it funny. Extremely funny. So funny she drops to the floor and starts laughing her ass off. After a good thirty seconds she starts grabbing her chest and coughing. I asked if she was okay when she starts wheezing and begins to convulse a bit. Freaking the fuck out and thinking she\\'s having a damn seizure, I start to reach for my phone.\\n\\nAnd in the exact second, my manager randomly decides to come in and sees this big guy towering over this poor little girl on the floor. I only manage to cut off her impending rage by saying I think she\\'s having a seizure and I\\'m calling 911. Fortunately, I was able to explain to her what happened after the ambulance came.\\n\\nTurns out she has asthma, and my joke caused a flare-up, and was waving her arms to try to tell me to get her inhaler. Whoops.\\n\\nTL;DR. Made I joke with a girl that ended causing a asthma flare-up, manager walked in when it happened. She ended up in the hospital and I almost lost my job.\\n\\n I found a flashdrive in my home and was curious as to what was on it. I put it in the computer and find folders full of family pictures and a video. It was blurred in the thumbnail, so OF COURSE i have to play it. \\n\\nIt all happened so fast.\\n\\nI see a dick. A hard, throbbing cock, staring me right in the eye.\\n\\nAnd then it\\'s cumming.  \\n\\nAnd after the last bit of cum drops, the camera gets aimed downward and I see my dad\\'s shoes and the tile in our bathroom. \\nI just watched my dad shoot his fucking load all over the bathroom tile. This dude filmed himself cumming in the bathroom. \\n\\nHe moved out a long time ago and obviously forgot that this flashdrive was here. I\\'m not going to give it back. I\\'m not going to assert dominance and return the favor. I\\'m going to burn it with fucking fire. \\n\\nTL;DR: I met my siblings today.\\n\\nEdit: With all the attention this is getting, I\\'d like to turn this fuck-up into something positive. Please consider donating to [Prevent Child Abuse America](https://preventchildabuse.org/)\\n\\nEdit 2: Fuck. The site got hugged to death lmao. Sorry you guys. So, i\\'m currently a 4th year computer science student at a pretty respected university and was looking to graduate this semester. One of the classes I was taking was a class in modern advancements and trends in the field of technology. While the class didn\\'t require to much heavy lifting it still was a higher level one and required a good amount of work. For our final, our professor had assigned us a 20-page research paper into a current or possible future technology of our choice within the field. I did my paper on helium-3 power generation. I worked my ass off on this paper and in the end was super proud of it. The papers were due last night at midnight and I held off on submitting my final draft till the end to get it as clean as possible. This is where I fucked up big time.\\n\\nLet me tell you a little about myself. I don\\'t work a normal job. I tried it in my first year of school and I really didn\\'t like it. I\\'ve worked internships when they came up but outside of that I really didn\\'t “work”. This and being a student really doesn\\'t mix well though. So, I had to make money some way. For the past 3 years I\\'ve gotten by on writing hardcore erotica on commission. Specifically, for furries. I would write anything. Any fetish, any premise, anything. In some parts of that community I became really popular. At one point I was making almost 2500$ on patreon along with the amounts I charged  to my customers. Am I proud of this? No. I have written some really disgusting stuff; but it paid the bills and the money was too good to pass up. I told myself the minute I got a “real” job I was cutting and running from this work.\\n\\nWell, this brings us to last night. I had not gotten any sleep for the past few nights. I had multiple projects due that in the span of a few days. I was running on nothing but coffee and rockstar. I was nothing more than a walking corpse and wanted to do nothing but sleep. I ended up doing my last read over of my final paper and submitted it before sleeping. However, instead of submitting my final paper, I somehow submitted one of the commissions I was working on. This commission is not light either. It is almost 10 pages long and contains a variety of things including vore and scat.\\n\\nSo, I went to bed. Submissions for the final locked and my academic career was sentenced to death then and there. When I woke up this morning I checked my grades for my other classes before noticing an email from my professor, all it says was to come to his office after class today.\\n\\nI want to fucking die right now. I don\\'t know how I\\'m going to explain why instead of my final I submitted a hard core erotic story with a wolf man jacking off in a dragons stomach. But yeah, I fucked up big time.\\n\\nTl:Dr: In my final semester at college. Instead of submitting my final research paper, I submitted hardcore furry erotica someone paid me to make. Professor “want\\'s to talk” and I want to die.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nobligatory update:\\n\\nWell, I just left his office and I still want to die. Not as much though. I took some advice from here and printed my paper out and had it with me.  I won\\'t lie, When I sat down with him I was already almost in tears from the stress and embarrassment. I guess he picked up on that because he tried to be as nice as possible and told me to calm down and just explain what happened.\\n\\nI ran down pretty much everything I said here. While he didn\\'t agree with the avenue I was taking to make money he understood why I was doing it.\\n\\nHe had checked the submissions last night after the deadline and my submission\\'s name stuck out immediately (it was along the lines of \"Customer\\\\_Commission\\\\_2nd draft.doc\"). I\\'ve taken a class from him before and was an A student so he guessed I had submitted the wrong file on accident. He told me he read the first page and \"realized it probably wasn\\'t meant for him to read\".\\n\\nI gave him the copy I brought and he accepted it. He told me to email him the file and he would replace the one I had submitted and that we would \"pretend this never happened.\" He seemed to at least have a good sense of humor as he told me that what I had originally submitted was \"well written at least\" from what he read.\\n\\nLike I said. I still want to fucking die right now. At least he understood that i\\'m just an idiot and not malicious . Thanks I guess for the advice and helping me through the nervous breakdown. My wife is working out of town for a couple weeks. Sometime over the weekend I noticed my son playing with this little silicone cup that kinda looked like a tulip. I asked him what it went to and what it did and he proceeded to show me it’s versatility- over the next few days it helped the Paw Patrol save the town, it was a treasure chest holding tiny pebbles guarded by pirates, a force field protecting a space ship. It came with us to the park, grocery shopping, and even out to dinner one night. I loved that it had its own little satchel and assumed it just went to a play set. \\n\\nFast forward to this morning and as we’re getting ready for school Alexa reminds us that it’s show and tell today at school. So my son grabs his little silicone cup and off to school he goes. I pick him up after school and his teacher asks to speak with me. My son looks happy so I figure he’s not in trouble, or if he is in trouble he did something cheeky that he’s proud of. \\n\\nOur conversation:\\n\\nTeacher: Ben’s show and tell was...interesting. \\n\\nMe: Yea! It’s cool right? We’ve been playing with that thing for days. \\n\\nTeacher: Uh, Mr. Scott, do you know what that is?\\n\\nI start to panic- oh shit it’s not a toy...\\n\\nTeacher...that is a, uh, menstrual cup. \\n\\nI get confused. \\n\\nTeacher notes my confusion: it’s um, used to collect menstrual blood...\\n\\nI’m still confused...\\n\\nTeacher: it uh, goes inside, and uh...collects blood\\n\\nMe: It just...stays in there? \\n\\nShe nods. \\n\\nMe: are you sure? I don’t think that would, uh, fit....too, uh...comfortably...there. \\n\\nTeacher: oh it folds in half then springs open inside....\\n\\nWe’re both clearly uncomfortable. \\n\\nMe: alright then.....so where do I get a replacement because my wife will probably not be too pleased when she returns home and will not want to continue using this one. \\n\\n\\nMy wife laughed hysterically when we told her. My son is non the wiser and is having a tea party with the cup right now.\\n\\nTL:DR thought my wife’s menstrual cup was a toy and my son and I played with it all weekend then he took it for show and tell\\n\\nEdit: WOW!!!! I cannot believe this got so much attention. I’m glad everyone got a good laugh. A bit uncomfortable hearing some coworkers discussing this and then pretending to read it for the first time so they wouldn’t know it was me, though. \\n\\nMy wife has been reading the comments and insisted that I clarify that I know all about her cycle. We are TTC currently and, just as it was with our son, I know when she’s ovulating, I track her cycle with her and (with our son at least) sometimes help give her the hormone shots. I grew up with 4 sisters and the only devices I was aware of for periods were to absorb the blood- not collect it. I was also confused by it “fitting” because, like I said, this device helped save a Chickoletta over the weekend. I’ve seen a tampon- they’re much slimmer than this cup is. My wife  assures me it fits just fine and she doesn’t even feel it’s presence after it’s im position. \\n\\nI’d like to try to upload a picture of the cup in the back of a tractor with a chicken riding in it but am waiting on my wife’s approval. So in these corona times I\\'m bored out of my mind so I downloaded a dating app.\\nI find a girl I\\'m really into and we connect on many things. She loves starwars, some games and she even likes football although she completely chose the wrong team to support. Anyhow  I\\'m a bit wary she might be a cat fish cause she\\'s hot as hell. At least a 10 maybe more. While I\\'m a 5 on my best days.\\nThere are a lot of catfish on the site so I ask her for a picture of her. She\\'s understanding and we exchange some pics. Nothing special. On one of the pics I spot a prostetic leg.\\nWell shit she\\'s probably a bit insecure about the whole thing so I decide I must tell her I noticed but don\\'t care about it.\\nYeah I think most of you probably think I\\'m an idiot already but don\\'t put the popcorn away just yet it\\'s about to get worse.\\nI haven\\'t mentioned the prostetic yet but I\\'m looking for an opportunity. We\\'re just throwing cheesy pick up lines at each other as it is something we\\'ve been doing for a couple of days now. I ask if she\\'s ever been jailed for stealing hearts. She respond to that with a \"Do you think I\\'m a thief?\" to which I respond \"I was thinking more about a pirate\".\\n\\nI haven\\'t had a response in 10 minutes.\\n\\nTL;DR: I called the one-legged beautiful smart girl I\\'ve been chatting with for days a pirate.\\n\\nUpdate: it might actually be fine. She got the joke and planned to get back at me by not responding for a while. I think I like her a bit more now.\\n\\nEdit: Holy shit this blew up! Thx for all the gold silver and other awards.\\n\\nI tried responding to as many ppl as possible but if you wanna pm me with questions I\\'d be happy to answer them in the future. [ORIGINAL POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/in9dks/tifu_by_telling_my_gf_of_3_months_that_i_love_her/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)\\n\\n[FINAL UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/iog7ch/tifu_by_telling_my_gf_of_3_months_that_i_love_her/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) \\n\\nOkay so the story has taken quite a drastic turn, so hold on to your seatbelts people.\\n\\nMy gf locked herself away in my room last night after I told her that I was on the phone with my mom. I tried explaining through the door that I cared for her and in time I’d surely love her, it’s just early for me and I would love to keep spending time with her. Silence from the other side of the door.\\n\\nI went to bed on the couch, hoping we would have a talk the next morning. Well I woke up today with her standing over me just staring. She didn’t say anything, she just stared. \\n\\nI was a little freaked out, I asked what was a going on. Silence. \\n\\nAt this point I’m like “okay silent treatment...” so I go to the kitchen to make some coffee and pancakes. Maybe I’ll win her over with food. \\n\\nShe starts muttering to herself while still standing at the couch, starting at me. Staring. Staring. Staring. I’m getting a little weirded out at this point. So I say, “I’m calling your mom.” She screams, loudest I’ve ever heard someone scream and it sounded like the blood curdling scream that people talk about hearing from murder victims.\\n\\nAt this point my heart is fuckin pounding I just about shit my pants and I ran for my room as she chased me. I managed to slam the door shut behind me and she starts pounding on it. Like throwing herself at the door trying to bust it down. The door is made of pretty solid wood so without something like a battering ram there’s no way my tiny 110lb girlfriend could break it down. And guess what? I left my fucking phone in the kitchen in my haste to get the fuck out of dodge. My only way out is through diplomacy, and this shit is gonna have to be more diplomatic than the fucking United States and Russia during the Cold War.\\n\\nAnyway, she starts crying, not just any crying either, like crying as if she found out she just lost her entire family in a freak accident. Screaming, “WHY WONT YOU LOVE ME. IVE DONE SO MUCH FOR YOU, WHY DONT YOU LOVE ME.”\\n\\nSo I go to the door and I yell, “LET ME TALK FOR FUCKS SAKE PLEASE YOURE SCARING ME.”\\n\\nShe stops talking, it’s silent, aside from some sniffles I hear behind the door. \\n\\nAgain, I reiterate that I care deeply for her, I just need more time to let my feelings grow, and continue on that train of thought. \\n\\nShe starts screaming again. Pounding the door for what felt like an eternity.\\n\\nI screamed “IM NOT COMING OUT AND THERES NO WAY YOU CAN GET IN. ILL JUMP OUT THE WINDOW TO ESCAPE IF YOU DONT QUIT.”\\n\\nShe runs out the door. Slams the thing shut. I figured it would be some kind of trick to get me out so I check the cameras in my home (I have cameras facing my door and facing my living room and kitchen, just in case). She’s gone.\\n\\nI rewind the footage from last night. I’m telling you this shit was psycho. She left my room at 1am walked to the couch where I was asleep, stood there watching over me for 49minutes, went back to the room. 3 am came around, I’m still asleep, she comes out, watches over me and at one point put her face next to mine, almost touching me nose to nose, and sat there for 22 minutes.\\n\\n5 am rolls around. She goes to the kitchen and grabs a dish rag (no clue why) stands over me for 2 hours (YES TWO FUCKING HOURS) until I wake up and my story starts as described above.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I’m a bit spooked and I don’t think this relationship will be continuing\\n\\nTLDR: girlfriend went absolutely psychotic on me, we are breaking up for sure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n**edit** guys I’m reading the responses yeah this is crazy lol! If I have any further updates I will be providing them. So far I think the saga is closed\\n\\nI’ve contacted her mom to pick up her stuff. So far, she is MIA. \\n\\nAlso I’m changing the locks today.\\n\\n**Edit 2** I know a lot of you guys want the video footage. But I’m going to abstain from posting that for now — just in case there could be some legal action or whatever. I don’t want to make a stupid decision to get me in trouble for a few bits of internet points\\n\\n**Edit 3**: I’ll take a little time to address the “OMG this is FAKE!” posts. First, I’m glad you have never had a crazy person in your life, I hope you never have to experience that. Second, well yes of course it’s going to come off as a creative writing story, I’m trying to tell a sequence of events with some sort of flow. Who would want to read a post that just gave all my details in bullet points? Nor do I care about some fake internet points. Well, fuck. \\n\\nNot a throwaway because I have no shame left to feel. \\n\\nTIFU by orgasming so many times I went blind in one eye. That’s right, catholics, your mother and that one creepy priest who smelt like bologna were right. \\n\\nSeriously, though. Last night I was trying to sleep (obligatory “not technically today”) but failing miserably. I have bipolar disorder, I’m off my medication (that is a TIFU in itself), and I was in the early stages of a manic episode. For those who aren’t batshit crazy or psychology majors (arguably the same thing) - that basically means my brain is in complete crackhead mode. I tried to lull myself to sleep by reading, working on my Mothman musical, and thinking about Al Gore. At about 3am, after laying in bed for five hours, I decided I had to exhaust myself physically rather than mentally. \\n\\n[Enter stage left] lesbian porn. Here’s the part where I mention how my clit is made of steel. I came twice, my usual, then thrice, barely a strain within ten minutes. For some reason, coming for the fourth time is always the most difficult. Having finished the porn (which I actually found on r/lesbians, thanks perverts!) I decide to dive into the disgusting depths of my imagination. Now, whenever I’m jerking off to just my vile thoughts, I always have to go completely under the covers. Unfortunately, it is extremely fucking hot where I live, and the only source of escape from the demonic heat is my floor fan which sounds like a blender giving birth to a garbage disposal. Super sexy background music to my masturbation fantasies, right? Anyway, for some reason I can’t come on my own if my head isn’t under some blankets/cloaked. Maybe Saudi Arabia is actually just extremely progressive towards female sexual pleasure? Since this incident I’ve only slept for four hours. I’m losing my mind. \\n\\nAnyway, at this point I’m abusing my clit harder than an elderly person with a touch screen electronic. After ten long ass minutes, which is essentially an eternity to my extremely efficient clitoris, that sweet wave of bliss crashes through me. My clit breathes a sigh of relief and I emerge from my very, very sweaty cocoon of sin. My right eye is stinging a little bit, and I realise the acne treatment I’d put on hours ago has sweated into my eye. I grab my water bottle and pour a little into my eye, roll over, and go the fuck to sleep.\\n\\nI’m sure you can see where this is going, but I certainly didn’t. And now I could probably only see half of it, considering half my vision is obscured by a fucking eye patch. I wake up in intense agony, spend half an hour rinsing my eye and freaking the fuck out. The weird angle I’m bent at over the sink causes my poor clitoris to recoil in sensitivity. For some reason, this made me so. fucking. angry. I felt genuinely betrayed. Like, how dare you? YOU did this to me. This is YOUR fault. Et tu, Clite? \\n\\nOnce my eye starts to swell up, I call the poison control line, lie through my teeth, and they tell me to go to the pharmacy. Arguably the weirdest walk of shame I’ve ever done. \\n\\nI continue to build my throne of lies in front of the pharmacists, who recommends some eye rinse and, if the swelling doesn’t go down, an eye patch. The swelling, my fellow comrades, did not go down. My eye is still blood shot, slightly stinging, and a lovely shade of “what the fuck have i done” red which pairs well with the itchy, puffy skin surrounding it. \\n\\nNow I’ve got a black eye patch, an angry clitoris, and a dick appointment for tonight that I’ll probably have to cancel. I’ve been wanting to bang this guy for WEEKS. Also, my eye still hurts like an absolute bitch, and I can’t even distract myself with meaningless sex because unless this dude has a pirate fetish I’m shit out of luck. \\n\\nTL;DR: I masturbated and now I’m\\ndown one eye, one clit, and one much-longed for dick.\\n\\nEDIT: Sweet baby jesus’s clit, what the fuck? This blew up and someone irl and sent it to me asking if I wrote it. Damn my unforgettable Mothman musical. Anyway, I did not cancel my dick appointment. I told him what happened and he found it funny/endearing. (Less endearing when I got to his place and wouldn’t stop dirty talking using pirate puns. I’ve never been more grateful for the colloquialism “booty”). Also, my eye no longer stings and the swelling has gone down. Hallelujah.\\n\\nEDIT #2: Clearly the reddit detectives have all suffered a stroke because numerous people have been sullying my good name in the comments with accusations of heterosexuality. To clarify: I’m bi. Also, thanks for all the cool shit and stuff, I guess. Our sex life has been pretty boring for the three years we’ve been married. We are both on our second marriage, I’m a widower and she’s divorced. \\n\\nMy late wife was very very adventurous and her first husband was vanilla missionary or nothing. \\n\\nOver lunch yesterday we talked about sex and how it’s become mundane with her admitting that she’s only really ever felt comfortable with “ordinary” sex because that’s all she’s known.  I suggested we get a book for her to read to get an idea of what she might like to try. \\n\\nSo we went into town to the bookshop and bought a book which she spent the next three hours reading in the bath. \\n\\nCome bed time, 9pm unusually, I’m dragged to bed and set upon in very pleasurable way until about an hour in I feel fingers caressing my anus and perineum.  Then a finger followed and to my surprise the one and only vibrator (a small one) we have was pushed inside of me.  Much pleasure was had until my wife gasped and started to sound worried. \\n\\nBehind me I felt a lot of fumbling, wife was sounding worried then just stopped and said sorry. I  asked what had happened, the vibe had slipped (been pushed) a little to far and had gone all the way in. \\n\\nFor the next hour we tried to excrete the thing and finally gave up, still buzzing inside. \\n\\nAs we’d both had a drink a taxi was booked and a trip to A&E was made.  \\n\\nIt took only a few minutes with a speculum, lube and forceps to remove the then quiet vibe from me and after promising to be more careful in future we returned home. \\n\\nThis morning I skipped my normal bike ride and have sat gingerly at my desk. \\n\\nWife just wandered in and wondered if I’d like to get a bigger vibe so it doesn’t get stuck.  I don’t know what I’ve awakened. \\n\\nTldr: bought wife a sex book and ended up in a&e with vibe stuck in my anus.\\n\\nUpdate. https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/i0v2ld/tifupdate_by_buying_my_wife_a_sex_book/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf\\n\\nThank you all Ever since I was a kid, I loved to fiddle around with staplers. Playing with the automatic ones and doing dumb stuff like any child would opening the manual ones and swinging it around, stuff like that. One of my favorite things to do was to open up a new strip of staples and break them apart before putting them in. Running my fingers through the staples, counting them and breaking them apart...love it. There are 210 staples in a standard strip and sometimes I’d break off each individual one until my fingers hurt. I’ve even found strips with 209 and 211 a few times.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis progressed from me messing around with staples in Ms. Grady’s second grade class, to buying a box of staples every other pay day to play with, to literally having a collection of different brands and sizes of staples in my college dorm to break apart. I had a problem, but no one was hurt, so who cares? Well...\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nFast forward to present day. I am a functioning middle-class adult with a wife and two children. I have a home, a normal car, an office job. I am by all accounts a normal human being... **I still love staples.** Working in an office with a supply room full of staples was a problem. I’d spend my lunch break in the room opening boxes and breaking apart staples to get my fix before returning to work. It got so bad over the course of a couple years that my boss changed our supplier because the boxes all had broken apart staples and were sometimes ripped.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo I had to stop doing that...I turned to Amazon first, buying 10 boxes of staples at a time for about 20 bucks a pop. It wasn’t enough. I went to 20, then 40. My wife got curious then and asked “why are you buying all of these boxes of staples”. But I brushed it off as a work issue that I’d get reimbursed for and knew I had to change my methods.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOver the course of a few months I enabled myself...I started using cash only at different office supply stores around my town and neighboring towns. I would sit in my car and break apart staples before going to the next store. I began to stay out late and tell my wife I would be home soon, so I could go buy more staples from different stores. I opened up a new credit card to put online so she wouldn’t know but she caught it in the mail. She got suspicious because things weren\\'t adding up.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis past Thursday after one of my “late nights” I get home with a trunk full of broken staples and 10 freshly broken boxes in my passenger seat to see my parents cars at my house. I walked in and everyone is sitting around like its an intervention. Because it is.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy wife asked if there was anything I wanted to tell them, and to tell the truth about my problem. I sat down and kept saying “what are you talking about” until my mom said “honey, we saw the pictures”. Then my wife tells me that my late nights, excuses, and general weirdness about the credit card, and some other little things made her hire a private investigator. This man followed me around to office supply stores and watched me “do something” with what I had in the bag from multiple stores. It basically looked like I was a drug runner for Office Depot who was using some of the product for myself. At this point my wife started to cry and my dad shook his head. I had to come clean and all I could muster was\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"I...I like staples.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe WTF looks I got afterwards turned into disbelief, then concern, then fits of laughter when I showed them my car....I came clean. I backed this up by showing my secret stash of used staples in my attic and explained the purchases on the card to my wife. Right now my only concern is my dad. He didn’t laugh - just kind of shook his head continually in disappointment without saying a word. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBelieve it or not, I think therapy or addiction meetings may help, as my wife gave me these suggestions the day after. I may or may not do that, but the good news is I now can have a “staple hour” once I get home and my  budget for staples is allowed by the wife for now.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR: I have an addiction to breaking apart staples and my wife thought I was on drugs when it became a problem.\\n\\nEDIT: \\n\\nThank you all for the suggestions on getting professional help, sharing how it brightened your day, and making me laugh with some of your comments as well! I am going to sit down for a while and try to respond to quite a few questions directly as well as here. If you want to copypasta or use my story in your youtube videos or whatever go right ahead, I just ask that you DM me/name the throwaway so I can find & watch it out of pure interest of other people’s perspectives on my problem.\\n\\n1. I went to see a therapist today with my wife. I was told that although the addiction is not typical in its damage regarding my mental or physical well being, I do need help. I am going to go through addiction counseling like any other addict would. Just tailored to my specific issue.\\n\\n2. Apparently, part of fixing my brain to know that it is not okay to continue this level of staplephilia. That included cleaning out my car, attic, and not garnering more attention through memorializing pictures, doing interviews, or trying to garner 15 minutes of fame from it. So after answering some questions about mental health and what the future holds, it will become less about reddit laughs and more about personal recovery.\\n\\n3. My wife initially thought I was having an affair. She didn’t think I was doing drugs until she got the pictures. The PI just told her what he saw, and she deduced that I had an undercover type distribution thing going with someone in the office supply business. She admitted that she didn’t think it all through, but her mind was racing and conclusions came as they did.\\n\\n4. I do not have autism or any diagnosed mental disability. I am just an addict, and an idiot. I know how stupid the addiction is and so I tried to hide it. It’s not a big deal in the grand scheme of things I guess, but my embarrassing white lie just spiraled out of control. As preface to this TIFU I am commiting one of the greatest societal taboos and revealing a secret that heretofore has been zealously guarded throughout the ages. It is a correlate to childbirth in that just as post-menopausal women wouldn\\'t dare tell an expectant mother how truly agonizing childbirth is, no man in his 50s would traumatize a man in his youthful prime with fears of the anatomical horror that is to come. But times have changed and new technology places men in grave danger, so now you must know of this biological atrocity, in order that you might avoid my disastrous FU....  \\nSometime around midlife, men\\'s hair follicles undergo a revolting mutation. While hair atop one\\'s head thins and drops, new hair grows in places you never imagined. Bristle-stiff tufts sprout outside and inside of ears, and up nostrils. Eyebrows become bushy, unruly and coarse. Pubic hair turns gray and scraggly (I shit you not). All these hairs grow alarming fast and require constant attention, lest you become that guy with a bunny paw sticking out of his ear. Their eradication is a battle men wage stoically and silently through the second half of their lives. And, as with any battle, there are casualties. Now, onto my TIFU.\\n\\nI found a great nose hair trimmer in the As Advertised On TV aisle at CVS. It looks like and operates like a minature hedge trimmer. It\\'s virtually impossible to cut yourself but mows down the hair.\\n\\nYesterday I was trimming ear, nose and eyebrow hairs after a shower. I was so happy with the results that I decided to try it on my pubes too. It worked great! Soon I had gone a bit overboard and pretty much shaved my balls and the base of the shaft to the skin. I liked the new look, but my bushy taint was a testicular neck beard that had to go.\\n\\nI positioned a make up mirror on the bathroom floor and laid down spread eagle, knees up, so I could see and trim everything well. Where once just a few wispy hairs prevailed, unbeknownst to me a virtual forest had arisen! Worst of all, my butthole was sporting Borat mustache assbrows. Trusty new nose hair trimmer in hand, I prepared for battle. \\n\\nThe assbrows had to go first. I began on the left and quickly decimated the bunghole caterpillar. I moved decisively to the right, prepared to take down assbrow two with one swift stroke close to the skin. However, this was not to be. Instead, my ass hairs wrapped around the trimmer blade like Rappunzel using a superheated curling iron, pulling the device tight against my skin and jamming the blade. The hairs were being ripped from my flesh and the pain was excruciating. No matter how I tried, I couldn\\'t remove the trimmer. Wiggling it  tugged the hairs more; restarting it was a double down that I lost - the hairs were wound even tighter against the blade.\\n\\nI frog walked naked to my bedroom, one hand holding the trimmer tied between my butt cheeks, and searched for my cuticle scissors. No luck. I did however find a carpet knife. Unbearable pain breeds desperation. Back on the bathroom floor, I tried in vain to cut myself free, nicking the tenderest of flesh twice and drawing the first blood of battle. I was making little progress and it was time to make the ultimate sacrifice. After a suitable prayer, I gripped tight on the trimmer and committed reverse harakiri, Brazilian wax style, ripping off the trimmer blade along with its assbrow net trap. Blinding pain left me curled fetal, hyperventilating, while blood slowly trickled down my ass crack.\\n\\nI decided to share my TIFU and expose life\\'s cruel secret in the best interest of mankind, that others may avoid falling prey to the technological wonders of As Seen on TV hair removal tools. Young men of Reddit, I beg of you to heed my warning. Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\\n\\nTL;DR used nose hair trimmer on bunghole brows, tore myself a new one.\\n\\nEdit:. I was pretty sure this TIFU would be popular but I\\'m genuinely blown away. 57,000 upvotes in a day!?!  54 awards!?!  My post in the same league as the coconut and poop knife!?!?!?!\\n So humbling. Thank you. \\nMany of you complimented my writing, and you have no idea how much that means to me.  I toiled as a construction industry technical editor for decades. I am writing a book but I\\'ve stalled several times. Your compliments are giving me inspiration to pick it up again.\\n\\nEdit 2.   This is the trimmer. YMMV. https://www.asseenontvlive.com/product/microtouch-max/ \\nNo, not clickbait, this is word for word what happened. Obligatory didn’t happen today, but I’ve never told anyone this story so I figured I should before I die.\\n\\nSo when I was about 7, my parents took me and my little sister to the park, as parents do. Someone had graffitied the slide with the word “fuck” and being the curious kid I was, asked my dad what it meant.\\n\\nI hadn’t had the “birds and the bees” talk yet, so my dad figured this was an appropriate time to do so. He goes through the basic idea, man puts peepee in woman and she has a baby grow in her tummy. That’s what the word meant! Too bad he forgot to tell me that it was a swear and NOT the proper term for the act.\\n\\nFast forward to a few weeks later, my parents sat me down and revealed that my mom was going to have another baby. I was confused. Don’t two people have to fuck to make a baby? I certainly never saw my parents do such a thing. So I had to ask.\\n\\n“When did you fuck?”\\n\\nObviously my mother lost it and demanded I tell her who taught me that word, whether it was one of the neighborhood kids or someone from school. I told her dad taught me. \\n\\nNeedless to say, my dad probably didn’t get another fuck for a while after that.\\n\\nTL;DR: Dad told me what “fuck” meant but forgot to tell me I shouldn’t say it; ended up asking mom why I never saw them make a baby in the most inappropriate way possible So this afternoon my wife was out at the pharmacy that\\'s less than three minutes from our house.  She called because our insurance card wasn\\'t working and asked for the numbers on the new cards we had just been issued. I started to read the numbers to her but she interrupted saying it would just be easier if I took a picture. To be funny I included my man parts in the photograph.  When she got home, I asked her how she liked the picture I had sent. She seemed genuinely clueless and didnt know what I was talking about.  Apparently she just handed the phone with the picture open to the pharmacist to grab the numbers off himself. \\n\\ntl;dr: sent my wife a dick pic with insurance info that she  subsequently showed to the pharmacist at our local grocery store.   I went and got a $29 haircut.  $29 after tax.  I went to pay with my card, stuck it in, then remembered I had cash, so I clicked decline on the card reader, and then went to pay with cash instead, all while conversing with the woman who just cut my hair.   I hand her $40 and she looks shocked.  I said \"I don\\'t need change\"   She said \"ohmygosh...are you sure?\". I\\'m like \"yeah!\" She asks me again \"oh my gosh are you serious? Seriously?\". I was like \"yes!\" And she\\'s like \"thank you so so much.  This is literally going to buy me and my kids dinner\" and I was like jeeze she must get bad tips...I start to walk away and she goes \"Oh actually your card transaction timed out!  You need to reinsert it.  It didn\\'t go through.\" At which point I realized she had no idea I meant to pay for all of it with cash and thought I was giving her a $40 cash tip for a $29 haircut.  And that\\'s the story of when I paid $70 for a $29 haircut.\\n\\nTLDR; decided to cancel card transaction and pay with cash, barber thought I was giving them the cash as a tip, and I was to embarrassed to correct them. Throwaway account.\\n\\nWe\\'ve all been seeing the recent craze of DNA testing and whatnot, so my dad and I decided to jump in the bandwagon and we bought 2 from 23andme. We got our results back a few days ago and I went into the DNA relatives section to check out my matches. At the top it listed my dad as only sharing 29.2% DNA with me and being predicted to be a half-brother, which is impossible. This didn\\'t make sense to me since we also shared a paternal haplogroup and we just look so alike, so he was definitely my father. My cousin also had taken the test a while back and she shared 24.6% with me, also predicted to be my half-sibling. We\\'re supposed to share around 12%, being 1st cousins.\\n\\nI couldn\\'t think of a genetic relationship that would explain what I was seeing and I had doubts in the accuracy of the percentages, so I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/b6mz22/are_my_shared_percentages_wrongaccurate/) on r/23andme, asking for help. Basically, the shared percentages are extremely accurate and highly unlikely to be false. The only realistic explanation for what I was seeing was that my uncle, my cousin\\'s father and my dad\\'s brother, is my father. Reality hit me in the face like a flying bag of bricks. All the dots lined up and I felt a sense of *loss*. I sat in my room for an hour just in shock and then I had a feeling of anger come over me. I needed some fucking answers. \\n\\nWithout even thinking, I rushed out of my room and confronted my mother downstairs. My mom is a business women and is often away on business trips. She had no idea my dad and I had done one of these tests since she was away on a trip and just got back. My mother and I never had a \\'traditional\\' relationship. She was always focused on her work and my dad ended up mostly raising me. \\n\\nMy irrational self didn\\'t even sugar coat it. I asked her if she cheated on dad with Uncle David (name changed for obv reasons). I have never seen the color drain from someone\\'s face so quickly. She looked dumbfounded and then mumbled \"What kind of question is this? Of course not.\" I told her everything; the test, percentages, DNA matches, ALL OF IT!! Shit hit the fan. My mom fell to the ground crying, begging me not to tell dad. \\n\\nI left her there and went back into my room. I called my cousin (now half sibling) and told her everything. She ended the call screaming. Dad (now uncle) then came home and stumbled into my room asking what\\'s wrong with mom. I told him everything too. He didn\\'t say anything after calming down. He left the room and I locked the door. \\n\\nFor the next few hours, I heard my entire family fall apart outside my door. My parents got into a heated argument and my grandparents rushed over to see what was going on. My aunt in law and David showed up shortly later and I\\'m pretty sure I heard my Dad and David get into some physical fight. Utter chaos. \\n\\nI feel like fucking shit. Ik it\\'s not my fault but I can\\'t help feeling that this is all because of me. If I had spent my fucking birthday money on something else, none of this would have happened, but another part of me is glad to know the truth. I\\'m too scared to go outside. I don\\'t even know what the outcome was. The only noise I hear in the house now is the occasional sobbing coming from my mother, and I sure my dad is out of the house. Fuck my life\\n\\nTLDR; Mom and uncle, both having spouses of their own, fucked, made me, and proceed to not tell anyone. I take a DNA test 19 year later and it all comes crashing down. I\\'ve locked myself in my room and I\\'m pretty sure my family has ceased to exist outside\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bbcqlk/tifupdate_by_destroying_the_entirety_of_my_family/ So my son moved back in with me because of the pandemic (he had to take a pay cut.) This isn\\'t really an issue because we get along great and I raised him alone. I also have a big enough house that he he has more of his own space. I\\'m 43, he\\'s 24.\\n\\nMy basement is a makeshift boxing gym. I have some free weights, punching bags, and boxing gloves, among other things. So when my son moved back in we both decided this could be a fun way to stay in shape and bond. We practice a few times a week.\\n\\nYesterday, we were sparring (no holds barred but we were wearing boxing headgear) and I guess I didn\\'t wrap my glove tightly enough, because it fell off and I didn\\'t notice and neither did my son. \\n\\nSo I go to punch, he gives me this deer-in-the-headlights look, like OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO and then I punched him, bare knuckled, in the face, without holding back.\\n\\nHe has a broken nose. I have two broken fingers.\\n\\nTL;DR: Absolutely lit my son\\'s shit up with a full-strength punch and now we\\'re both out of commission for a few weeks. Also, I bought new boxing gloves. And duct tape. I still feel bad but he isn\\'t upset, and we\\'ve been laughing telling other people the story. Well, this didn\\'t happen today. But it\\'s a funny story that I couldn\\'t share with reddit at the time.\\n\\nRewind back to me at 14 years old. Awkward, naive, constantly horny and still oblivious to the fact that websites dedicated to porn existed. \\n\\nAs such, my attempts at finding stimulating material usually resulted in me typing \"boobs\" and \"butts in thongs\" into google search and then immediately deleting my history. \\n\\nOne night, to avoid watching TV with my Dad, his wife and her two kids downstairs, I claimed that I had \"homework\" to do. Of course, this was a lie. I just wanted boobs and butts in thongs and some private time. \\n\\nSo I fired up the old desktop, got internet explorer up and running, went straight to google and started getting my freak on.\\n\\nNow this is where things went wrong. I got horny and forgot the layout of my house.\\n\\nYou see, my bedroom was upstairs and I had no door. A sort of spiral staircase (think straight edges though) led up to my open room, which was located almost directly above the living room--where, again, my Dad, his Wife, and her two kids were watching TV. \\n\\nThe desktop was right next to the staircase, but I figured that the TV was loud enough to mask the sounds of my sins. I was right.\\n\\nBut what I didnt account for was the big white wall, directly to my right, that the staircase adjoined...and how it was visible from living room. \\n\\nI also didn\\'t register that the reading lamp on my nightstand, which was turned on and so very bright, was to my left and pointed directly at me. \\n\\nI eventually did notice, however, that the tv downstairs had gone quiet and that no one in the living room was talking.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s when I turned to my right and looked at the wall and realized that I was casting a giant Shadow Puppet of me masturbating across its entire length. A perfect, shadow projection of my penis and hand stretched across its surface. And I had no idea how long ago the people downstairs had noticed it.\\n\\nSo I did what anyone would do in that situation. I put my dick away (as did my shadow puppet), pulled up my pants, walked into my bathroom and sat there until I heard the TV come back on. Then I went to bed without saying a word and left early for school the next day. \\n\\nNo one ever brought it up. And I\\'m thankful. But I know what they saw. And I\\'m still cringing.\\n\\nTl;dr: Got horny. Got stupid. Projected a Masturbating shadow monster for my whole family to see. Still embarrassed.\\n\\nEdit: Well shit. Glad yall are enjoying this funny little moment. 14 year old me would me mortified.\\n\\nEDIT: Holy fuck lmao. I\\'m proud and ashamed of how much yall liked this. Ever since he was a kitten, my cat and I had come to an understanding.  Let me explain. My cat generally doesn\\'t like being picked up. However, one time, six years ago, a moth flew into my house. My cat wanted to kill it, but he couldn\\'t reach it. I don\\'t know how I got the idea, but I picked him up to help him reach it. At first, he squirmed, then when he realized he could reach the moth, he forgot about me and proceeded to murder the moth.  Afterwards, I\\'d put him down, give him a treat and a couple pets. And from then on, we had pact. When a moth, spider, or some other bug was out of reach, I\\'d pick him up and my cat would kill it. Truly a win-win situation.\\n\\nFast forward six years to today. A moth flew into my bedroom. Just as I get up to kill it, I see my cat staring intensely at it. He\\'s got this determined, adorable, murderous look on his face. As I\\'m looking at him, he turns to me and I can almost see the pleading in his eyes, \"Please, I got this.\" \\n\\n\"Okay,\" I respond. I pick him up and he starts waving his paws in what are several failed attempts at catching the moth (wtf boy? Maybe a little rusty at this). Then, in what can only be described a 400 IQ move, the moth flies directly at my cat. My cat panics and flails everywhere. I scream and drop him from about 7 ft up (he\\'s fine). Pain.  There is only pain.  I look at my [arm](https://i.imgur.com/3fDLYDo.jpg).  In the moment, I have no idea how bad it is, so I just rush to the bathroom to disinfect my arm. Fortunately, it\\'s not that bad. It just stings whenever I move left arm or hand.\\n\\nI walk back to my room and see the fucker just [laying there](https://i.imgur.com/jM1Ht43.jpg). \"You see [this](https://i.imgur.com/44Eyq8v.jpg) shit?\" I asked him. He sniffed it a bit and just kind of looked unconcerned. \"Meh, just a minor flesh wound. Didn\\'t even rupture an artery. My claws must be dull. I mean, that looks bad.\" \\n\\nI go back into my room and see the moth there. I go to kill it and my cat makes this weird trilling sound. He\\'s staring intensely at the moth eyes filled with murder lust. He looks at me for permission.  This time, I killed the moth. \\n\\ntl;dr: cat broke our murder pact. probably should never have formed one with a cat anyway. Obligatory \\'this didn\\'t actually happen today\\', etc. \\n\\n\\nSo when I was 14 I got into a huge fight with my mother and she sent me to live with my aunt and uncle. It was an incredibly stressful event, and combined with my innate shyness about pooping anywhere but at home, at first I didn\\'t notice that I wasn\\'t pooping. After about two weeks I began to feel awful and tried, without success, to shit. It had built up so much that I think it was impacted. To top it off, my aunt and uncle were weird about bathroom stuff (partly due to having one bathroom in a household of 5 people) and twice while trying to force it they knocked on the door and asked what was taking so long, which made the whole thing worse. \\n\\n\\nI didn\\'t tell anyone, partly out of embarrassment and partly out of fear of getting in trouble. (They were strict and I did get in trouble for random things). Another very uncomfortable 2 weeks passed, until one day, a month to the day that I had first arrived and the last time I had pooped, I was sent out to rake some leaves and I was just in total agony. I went back inside and told my aunt what was going on. She was thankfully very understanding (although incredulous that I had waited so long to tell her) and told me she\\'d had poop issues her whole life. She went out and got me laxatives, suppositories and a fleet enema and showed me how to use it. At this point I was in so much pain and just sweating bullets and dying for relief. \\n\\n\\nThe remedies barely helped matters, but in an hour or so I hopped on the toilet and tried to make things happen. \\n\\n\\nI put both hands on the walls and pushed with all my force, knees up to my chin, straining with all my might. I\\'ve since given birth and I pushed harder during this shit than I did pushing out my son. It hurt *so bad* and I felt I was straining every muscle in my body to void this beast. After 10 or so horrifying minutes I still wasn\\'t having any luck, and I began wondering if I should ask to go to the hospital, but the idea of a doctor digging shit out of my asshole way just too much to bear, so I pressed on. After 15-20 agonizing minutes, grunting and straining and thrashing and pleading with my ass to cooperate, finally, finally, I heard my first heavy *plop*. Oh thank God! I cried from the pain and shock and relief. The first foot or so of poop wasn\\'t much easier, it was so hard and dry. I had to twist and strain for awhile, but after that it got a bit easier. About 30 minutes in I stood up and looked into the bowl. Have you ever had a shit so large, so complete that it entirely filled the rim of the toilet, halfway up the bowl rising above the water in thick brown and black coils, iced with a significant amount of blood? I have. I have never and I mean never seen a pile of human shit like that and hope never to again. I would say about 3-4kg of shit. About the size of a large round birthday cake.\\n\\n\\nI flushed once, twice, plunged, and got back on the toilet for round 2. It just kept coming. This part was significantly easier, despite the fact that my ass had torn a little in the process of round 1. Round 2 was about 3/4 of the size of round 1. Finally, the flood stopped, and I gingerly wiped, flushed, cleaned the toilet and emerged from the bathroom a changed person. I ached inside for a few days after but oh my god the relief was incredible. I\\'ll never forget that day as long as I live. \\n\\n\\nTL;DR; didn\\'t shit for a month, had the most painful shit apocalypse ever and lived to tell the tale. I have a 5 year old dog, had him since he was 3 months old. Love him to death, he\\'s an amazingly playful dog (Jack Russell).\\n\\nA few years ago, he started developing really itchy red skin on his toes, and the poor pup would constantly lick his toes to the point where he was making them almost hairless. Took him to the vet, they said it was allergies, and prescribed him medication ($60 a month!). We\\'ve been buying this medication for him ever since, occasionally skipping a few weeks and using a mini-dose of Benadryl until we purchased more allergy pills. The pills helped, as in he wasn\\'t constantly licking his toes all the time, but he would still lick them so it wasn\\'t a surefire solution. Let\\'s say 80% cure.\\n\\nNow, on to the fuckup. We tried giving him the pills with nothing, and he just puts them in his mouth and spits them out. So, we started putting them in a little bit of peanut butter, which he licks off a spoon (and the pill gets swallowed along with the PB).\\n\\nA few weeks ago we ran out of peanut butter, so we used jello instead. It worked just as well because he swallowed it right up. Over the next few days we did the same thing, and he wasn\\'t licking his toes AT ALL. Lightbulb...we took our dog to the vet to get an allergy test (which we should have done FROM THE START).\\n\\n**Test Result:** Dog is allergic to peanut butter. We\\'ve been giving him his allergy pills dipped in the substance he\\'s allergic to.\\n\\nHe\\'s a happy dog now with no more itchy toes!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**TL;DR**Spent around $2k on allergy pills over 3 years to battle dog\\'s allergiesDipped his pills in peanut butter to get him to swallow themHe\\'s allergic to peanut butter\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Edit:** Pills are Apoquel 5.4mg\\n\\n&#x200B; My cousin decided it would be a good idea to give my dad two squares of THC chocolate for Christmas, because he\\'d mentioned that maaaaaybe he\\'d want to get high. My parents are 75-year old Republicans. That was a big maybe.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWell, my mom is like an unsupervised puppy when it comes to chocolate. You put half a candy bar down and YOINK, gone when you come back.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nYou can guess what happened. My mom went sniffing for some chocolate and found it, and ate both squares of chocolate (\\\\~8-16 doses, depending on one\\'s tolerance) and got so high that she couldn\\'t move or talk. Her last words, high as a kite, were \"I think this might be the end?\" before my dad, fearing she\\'d had a stroke, called an ambulance.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThey took her to the hospital and when she came around a bit, the doc asked her what she\\'d eaten and she said, just two squares of chocolate. At which point I assume my father facepalmed and my parents had to tell the doc that my mother was in fact, simply higher than the RedBull Orbit Jumper.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnyway they ran every test in the world on her and found out she had major blockages in three coronary arteries, 97%, 98% and 99%. So now she\\'s having a triple bypass tomorrow.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR - Mom got high as balls by accident, turned out it saved her life.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nObligatory gold edit: Thanks all for your well wishes! ! A few things to clear up - Mom went into the hospital on Saturday. As of now, she\\'s been transferred to a hospital in Manhattan where she awaits surgery details. I\\'m in Canada for work, so it\\'s kind of tough not being able to hold my mom\\'s hand, but I\\'m planning to head back down to NY this weekend to be with her. Also....OP is not a dude. :)\\n\\nSecond update from my dad: Mom\\'s surgery may be Thursday, with the holidays and all. I decided not to mention that I put the story on the internet.\\n\\nFP Edit - Thank you so much for your kind words, shared stories, kind offers, and encouragement. I\\'m headed back to the States on Thursday, the tentative surgery date. Will post an update and see if my mom will let me take a selfie of the two of us.\\n\\nUPDATE - Mom ended up having a quadruple bypass and is recovering nicely. Thanks to everyone who checked in, offered help, and got a laugh out of the story. All of the staff at the hospital knew about it and they thought it was hilariously serendipitous.\\n\\nCheck out my adorable mom\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[http://imgur.com/gallery/0bmG2Ii](http://imgur.com/gallery/0bmG2Ii) Came home from the gym. Its leg day. Had full day at work too. Work isn\\'t bad. Came home to happy kids. Wife does a great job at keeping them alive. The best. Had to take a shower before bed. Wife says hurry because shes tired. I empathize by saying I will hurry because I am also tired. Bad idea. Wife proceeds to tell me how she is the most tired because of kids. I do not dispute this since I am not a total moron. Kids are exhausting but totally worth it. I tell her as much. She is most tired. I am only kind of tired. Not good enough. She is more tired. I agree with this in order to ease the tension. Unsuccessful. She is fully triggered by the fact that I had the audacity to say that I was tired. There is no escape. Am screwed. \\n\\n\\nTldr: am not allowed to be tired. Ever.\\n\\nEdit: wow. That\\'s a lot of comments and stuff. Thanks, reddit. This weekend I will celebrate with a nap! Cheers! What makes this cool is that I wrote it while pooping before bed. Cant wait to tell my wife!\\n\\nEdit 2: my wife is the best. Seriously the best. I\\'m not taking her back to the dealership. This was one of those events where you laugh about it 5 minutes later.  Tonight we are going on a date so it\\'s all good.\\n\\n\\nTIL that a lot of you guys would not survive married life or kids. Lol.\\n\\nFinal edit: I am so thankful for my normal wife her normal, valid frustration with how I said what I said. Either one of us could have easily ended up with one of you nut cases on here. Lol. I can never  unsee some of this cringe and I cant wait to share all of these hilarious/insane opinions with her durning our date tonight. Gotta go put on my clean underpants! **- This story is faked to show you that people shouldn\\'t believe everything they read on the internet -**\\n\\nI was reading this TIFU post about a mother who told her 4 year old that her hero Bob Ross is dead. One part got me in a fit and naturally my girlfriend asked me what made me laugh, so i started explaining the story in short.\\n\\nAs soon as I told her the kid had to cry because she had just been told Bob was dead, all colour left her face. With tears in her eyes and a pouting lip she asked me if I was serious - I explained to her that Bob Ross had in fact died in 1995, showing her the Wikipedia page to corroborate it.\\n\\nMy girlfriend is up there on the cries-because-swans-can-be-gay spectrum, so surprising here with this fact was not a smart move. The weeping waned away, but the sad and defeated mood stayed and now I\\'m on my way to pick up a bottle of wine and a tub of ice cream,so we can enjoy that during a Bob Ross paint-along.\\n\\nI guess it\\'ll be a watercolour made with tears. Thanks, /u/garryoak\\n\\nTL;DR Girlfriend didn\\'t know Ross was dead. Now she does. Tomorrow I\\'ll be turning 32.  As we were waking up this morning she asked me if I was excited for the plans we\\'d made for my birthday. I responded that it was going to be tough to do everything in half a minute, but I was looking forward to it nonetheless.\\n\\nShe looked at me, blank-faced for a couple seconds. I thought she was just trying to make sense of what I had said. Instead she suddenly smacks my chest and yells at me that I ruined a joke she\\'s been holding onto for years. I didn\\'t believe her until she showed me an email from 2016 that she had sent to herself to remind her to set a calendar event so she wouldn\\'t forget. \\n\\nIt took her ten minutes before she was calm enough to talk to me again. Unfortunately for her I\\'ve known and used the 30-second birthday joke for years.\\n\\nTL ; DR\\n\\nMade a stupid joke to my wife about my 32nd birthday only being 30 seconds long and found out she\\'s been saving this joke to use for the past three years. Oops.\\n\\nEDIT: I\\'m honestly surprised that I have to say this, but this was all in good fun. My wife is fucking awesome and probably one of the chillest, low-maintenance people I\\'ve ever known.  We have been laughing about this all day. The number of reddit relationship therapists showing up to tell me about my unhealthy relationship is staggering. I got out of a bad relationship a few months ago and only recently felt good enough to get out of the house again. This was my first-ever boyfriend and he turned out to be a piece of crap, so I was obviously a bit hesitant. But some old friends from high school were visiting my town and asked if I wanted to go on a bar crawl with them and I figured fuck it, it\\'s not like anything will happen (other than getting drunk with some pals), so why not? \\n\\nAt the first bar we run into a group of guys from my University. I had seen some of them around but never spoke to them before. One of my friends decides she\\'s going to force me to \"get out of my shell\" and drags our group over to talk with them. I\\'m EXTREMELY quiet (like... weirdly quiet to most people) so I end up sitting in the corner of our booth and not saying anything, just drinking and feeling awkward. Well, one of the guys in the other group (let\\'s call him Adam) is also being weirdly quiet. So my friends and his friends, who are already tipsy, decide to make things as awkward as possible by making us play truth or dare--except we have to drink when we don\\'t want to answer something. \\n\\nThere are a lot of personal/sexual questions neither of us want to answer, so we end up drinking quite a bit. And by the time we\\'re done the first bar, Adam and I are on a whole different plane of existence from everyone else. And it turned out we had a lot in common, and he was pretty cute, and we\\'re goofing around and laughing the whole time. I started to get butterflies in my stomach, and not just from the alcohol. Adam has my exact sense of humour and is really sweet and kind. We wander off and start having deep drunk conversations about feeling left out of things and how annoying it is when people say shit like \"Can they speak?\" I tell him I\\'m walking home and he offers to walk with me. I know where this is going but I\\'m drunk enough that I don\\'t feel nervous, plus I feel like I have a genuine connection with this guy. Our friends are wolf-whistling as we leave and instead of being embarassed, I feel weirdly proud. \\n\\nSo we get to my place, talk and smoke for a bit, and do the deed. I wake up earlier than him and decide I\\'m going to make a nice breakfast. I want to impress him and show him I like him, and everyone likes a good breakfast when they have a hangover, right? So I sneak out of bed and make scrambled eggs, french toast, and sausage. I prefer almond milk so I use that for the eggs and french toast. He wakes up and tells me I look just as cute sober. At this point I\\'m convinced he\\'s the love of my life. He sees the breakfast and gets excited and I\\'m like yes! My plan worked! I\\'m going to get to his heart through his stomach! \\n\\nWe eat and everything\\'s going great for a few bites. Then he makes a weird face and clears his throat. His eyes start to widen and he asks me what if there were nuts in the bread or something. I say no, but I used almond milk. He jumps out of his chair and says \"CALL AN AMBULANCE RIGHT. NOW.\" I\\'m freaking the fuck out. He\\'s wheezing and stuff and looks absolutely panicked. I ask if he has an epipen and he shakes his head no. So I call an ambulance and tell them he\\'s having an allergic reaction and paramedics come and haul him off. \\n\\nThis happened last weekend. I have not heard back from him since. I found his buddy and confirmed he is not dead. I guess accidentally triggering a severe allergic reaction does not lead to romance. \\n\\nTL;DR: Tried to impress my romantic interest by cooking for him. He went into anaphylaxis and no longer wants to speak to me. I have grapheme-color synesthesia. Basically I see letters and numbers in colors. The letter \\'E\\' being green for example. A couple months ago I was explaining it to my boyfriend who\\'s a bit of a skeptic. He asked me what colour certain letters and numbers were and had me write them down. Since then he\\'ll randomly quiz me and compare my awnser to what I said a few months ago. Always being the sameish as course. He still seemed a bit skeptic as if maybe I just memeroized them really really well.\\n\\nTonight we were laying in bed and my boyfriend quized me again. I tried explaining to him I just see the colors automatically when I visualize the letters in my head. I asked him what colour are the letters in his head. He looked at me weirdly like what do you mean in \"my head, that\\'s not a thing\" \\n\\nMy boyfriend didnt understand what I meant by visualizing the letters. He didn\\'t believe me that I can visualize letters or even visualize anything in my head. \\n\\nTurns out my boyfriend has aphantasia. When he tries to visualize stuff he just sees blackness. He can\\'t picture anything in his mind and thought that everyone else had it the same way. He thought it was just an expression to say \"picture this\" or etc... Its crazy to him the fact that I can picture his face without looking at him or a banana without looking at it.\\n\\nNow I have a boyfriend that is really upset. He feels like his world is turned upside down and every body else has this cool superpower. He\\'s been texting all his friends and see if they can imagine stuff and realizing I wasnt pulling his chain. Hes pretty upset and I feel really bad. \\n\\nTldr tried to explain what having synesthesia is like to my bf and turned his life upside down by finding out he has aphantasia. (Cant visualize anything at all)\\n\\nEdit; Oh wow this blew up. I just wanted to say my boyfriend wasn\\'t being a jerk when it came to quizzing me,  it was more of a fun curiosity thing/science experiment. He never thought I was lying. I think it\\'s one thing to wrap your head around synesthesia when you can visualize normally but it\\'s way harder when you have aphantasia. This actually happened yesterday and I still cant stop laughing. \\nSo 5 month ago I met a girl though mutual friend, first she added me on social media we talked for a bit and then exchanged numbers. About a week later we went on a date, it went well. Then we started \"dating\" we would meet up once or twice a week and do things together. We were doing things that normal things that couples do. Sometimes she would come over to place and stay for a day or two. \\nSo, around 2 weeks ago she said she wasnt feeling okay and she needed some time alone. I said sure and did not really say anything. Yesterday she messaged me we talked for a bit and she said she was now feeling better. I asked her why she wasnt feeling okay she said it was because she broke up with her boyfriend. Turns out SHE HAD A BOYFRIEND even she started dating me. When I asked why she never told me she said it was because I never asked and she was actually considering me more like a friend. \\n\\nTl;DR: I just learned that my girlfriend actually had a boyfriend My husband and I have always had an inkling that our son was on the LGBTQ spectrum. My son coming out to me was not a shock in the grand scheme of things.\\n\\nI went up to my son’s room to ask what he wanted for dinner. I knocked and went in. I was tired after work and things weren’t really registering. He just said “Mom, I’m gay.”\\n\\nFor some reason it just didn’t register that he had just told me something so major for him. I don’t know what part of my brain thought this was a good idea, but I just said, “ok, do you want pizza for dinner?” \\n\\nIt took a few minutes for me to realize what I said and that I did not react properly. I went back to him and apologized and gave him the whole “I love you just the same” spiel and we laughed about my reaction, but I’m still SO embarrassed and mad at myself. Definitely wasn’t the way I had always planned to respond!\\n\\nTl;dr was tired after work and said “ok” and offered my son pizza after he came out to me My wife has a history of startling/scaring me easily due to me being deaf in one ear from tinnitus (mawp) which has dramatically decreased my situational awareness. She finds it hilarious and I’ve grown to tolerate it cause of love and all. \\n\\nI decided my time for revenge had come. \\n\\nCut to dinner time, about to boil a box of rigatoni pasta when the inspiration hits me from a video on social media I saw. I hide a piece of that rigatoni between my teeth and make my way into the living room where my wife was relaxing on the couch after a long day of being a nurse. \\n\\n“Hey sweetheart, do you mind rubbing my neck? I feel like I have a kink in it or something” I ask her. At this point I can barley contain my excitement for this amazing prank as she happily begins massaging my neck for me. \\n\\nAfter 30-45 seconds, I then bite down hard on that piece of uncooked rigatoni which released a sickening yet satisfying crunch sound. I give a little “ow” sound and immediately go limp, falling face first into the couch. \\n\\nNow my wife is mostly a calm, non-emotional type person, but her visceral reaction of terror and worry and panic that came flooding out of her while she started to shake my limp body and began to check my vitals made me feel guilt I’ve never felt before. After only a short time I give up on the ruse and show her it was just pasta. \\n\\nTo say she was livid is an understatement. Been sleeping on the couch ever since. Worth it. \\n\\ntl;dr: I revenge pranked my wife by making her think she killed me.\\n\\nEDIT: Wow, thanks everyone. Lots of the same questions/comments being asked so I can’t answer them all; HOWEVER: My wife and I have an extremely healthy, understanding, and communicative marriage and it’s been so for many years. Just wanted to put that to rest. \\n\\nI give rBangerz YT permission to use this post for a video. So I’ve been delivering for dash dash on the side for a few weeks now. Today I had a typical order from a local sushi joint. I saw the order for a fellow named Tom...funny thing the second half of the order is EXACTLY TO THE TEE what my gf ALWAYS gets. Two dragon rolls extra Siracha on the side and a large Ice Tee. She is very particular! She also has a co-worker named Tom she has mentioned AND she said she spent the night up in Denver with her sister last night for a girls night. Hmmmmmm....Picked up the order and was on my way. Pulled up to a waaaaaay nice apartments knocked on the door and a very handsome fellow named Tom answered. Handed him the food and heard a familiar voice say “Make sure there’s  Siracha!” It was my now ex gf in a T-Shirt and panties. I said nothing she said nothing... door closed and well now I’m single! And onto me next Dash better make that money if I’m going to be back on Tinder. TLDR delivered a Door Dash to my now ex gf while she was cheating on me with her coworker. Tall Handsome man with a nice ass apartment. This around five minutes ago . I feel so nervous right now.\\n\\nSorry for the weird format, I’m writing this in mobile.\\n\\nSo I (17 f) am bisexual as said in the title. My family is very religious and most of them are homophobic. Today, we had to go to church. Now, for some background information here, I’m considered “the perfect Christian girl” and it fucking sucks. I have to pretend to be someone I’m not just to satisfy many of these   people. Today I was in a really bad mood, and when my family and I  went to church, they started talking about LGBTQ people.\\n\\nNothing out of the ordinary.\\n\\nI don’t know what came over me, but I started to defend them. Definitely didn’t look suspicious. When I was in the middle of an argument with an adult, this kid says “you sound so gay right now defending those abominations”. \\n\\nI snapped and said “ I’m bisexual you ignorant idiot”.\\n\\nBest way to come out.\\n\\nAnyway, the realization didn’t hit me until five seconds after. Currently I’m in a bathroom typing this.\\n\\nTL;DR I went to church, defended LGBTQ people and came out of the closet in the worst way possible.\\n\\nEdit: First of all, thank you guys for the support. As for the people at church, we had a little talk. They said that this news are not very pleasant in the slightest, but I convinced them to think about giving LGBTQ people a chance. Some apologized to me, but others looked at me differently. My mother said she actually supports me :D! Again, thank you guys for the support, but I think I have to take a break from everything.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nA bisexual mess.\\n\\nEdit 2: After some thinking, I came to the conclusion that I have to say that you guys are awesome too. Some of you guys are probably going through some tough times too, and I just wanted to say that many people will support you no matter what. It also astonished me that you guys came over and supported a stranger that you will probably never meet and for that, you guys are strong and brave. Thank you. Last summer. We\\'re on a road trip from New Mexico to Mexico. We have a Honda Element converted for living in, so I crawl in the back to nap while he\\'s driving. He stops at a gas station in the desert of Arizona and while he\\'s pumping, I get out to use the bathroom. Come back out, don\\'t see him, and walk around the parking lot to have a look. I jokingly think to myself that maybe he drove off not knowing that i got out to use the restroom, but brush that off. I sit on a bench outside twiddling my thumbs, realizing this may now actually be the case. I reach for my phone to call him, but of course my phone is in the car.\\n\\nI go back inside to ask the cashier to use their phone, but she says they don\\'t have one. Obviously they do, but whatever. So I start asking random people in the store to use their phone, which makes people visibly uncomfortable because we\\'re in the middle of nowhere and they think I\\'ll steal it I guess. I go back outside and continue asking strangers for their phone. I realize I don\\'t know my boyfriends number by heart so I just call my phone repeatedly, hoping he\\'ll answer. He doesn\\'t. I use one person\\'s phone to log into my facebook to find my boyfriend\\'s number, but alas, his phone is dead when I call.\\n\\nI resort to explaining to everyone whose phone I ask to use my situation. Some don\\'t believe me, others feel really bad, and one man offered to buy me a hotel room for the night in the next town over thinking that my boyfriend left me on purpose and I was just being modest. It\\'s been about 2 hours now. The store clerks through the windows have been looking at me suspiciously for a while, I\\'m still sitting on this bench in the desert, and have no idea what to do and start bawling my eyes out.\\n\\nA cop car pulls up and the officer comes to me and lets me know the store clerks called them because ive been loitering, haggling people for phones outside of their store and crying. I explain my situation and shes as confused and sympathetic as all the other people. She tells me I can\\'t stay there so she can either take me to a truck rest stop in the town over or go to the police station. I ask her to take me to the rest stop, although shes not convinced that my boyfriend legitimately left me there on accident. We\\'re driving down the highway when on her radio another cop says he\\'s at the gas station and there\\'s a guy there looking for his girlfriend. I just crack up and she does too, flips the car around and takes me back. And there my boyfriend is standing outside of his car, banging on the windows and nearly crying because he couldn\\'t believe he\\'d actually done that. \\n\\nHe said he was passing some really cool scenery far into the drive and went to wake me up to see too when he realized I wasn\\'t in the car, flipped it around and drove faster than he\\'s ever driven in his life to get back to the gas station. And that he wondered why so many people kept calling me, but didnt feel comfortable answering my phone. He thought for sure that was the end of our relationship and the trip was ruined. \\n\\nEDIT: I understand IFU by not relaying my need to pee.\\nAlso that it all sounds really stupid objectively and in retrospect, but it makes sense how things happened at the time. Also have never heard of this Last Man on Earth episode until now, so that\\'s pretty funny. I have many a text message/facebook post to prove this happened IRL.\\n\\nNot so great Element/Trip pics: http://imgur.com/gallery/SVBZIwp\\n\\n\\nTLDR: went to use the bathroom while my boyfriend was pumping gas, he didn\\'t know, drove off, and I was stranded, asking people to use their phones for hours until police were called to come get me. With a 15yo boy in the house, my husband and I have grown used to the ×knock knock× ×laptop screen slam× \"juST A MINUTE!\" ×scramble scramble× \"...ok\" dance. We have grown used to silently replenishing his room with tissues almost daily. We have grown used to herding the two younger ones to the downstairs bathroom while they wonder why their brother is taking so long in the shower. We have even grown used to the occasional tightly bundled sheets or towels in the laundry hamper with a sticky note on top reading \"wash separately\".\\n\\nWe did not anticipate that the minute everyone else was out of the house, the living room would become fair game. Having driven halfway down the block without my phone, I decided to just walk back to my house because parking in my weird driveway takes more time than the walk. I unlocked and opened the front door in the span of a couple of seconds. This was my mistake. How could I be so careless as to expect to be able to just open my own front door? What was I thinking? I should have knocked. I should have pointedly jangled my keys for 30 seconds before unlocking the door. I should have worn a cowbell.\\n\\nAnything to prevent me from seeing my darling offspring, my beautiful baby boy, my only son, pants down, humping the couch through a strategically placed towel. WHY?\\n\\nTldr: found out in the worst possible way that my teenage son is having an affair with my couch. At least he used protection.\\n\\nEdit: WOAH! Did not expect that many responses! I promise we had a gentle conversation about how it\\'s normal and natural but please not in public areas of the house even if we\\'re out. He\\'s embarrassed, I\\'m embarrassed, he hasn\\'t been able to make eye contact with me yet, but I\\'m sure he\\'ll be fine tomorrow. [UPDATE](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/g3hmo4/tifu_wormageddon_update/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)\\n\\nThis fuck up has been set up perfectly for disaster over the past few months and is continuing to destroy my life. This is a long one, but every detail counts in portraying one of the worst weeks of my life. \\n\\nLet me preface this by saying I love my cat more than anything, and while he is currently not sleeping anywhere near me, he\\'s still getting a lot of cautious love. I can\\'t imagine being self-isolated alone without him right now. Truly, I love him too much - too much love got us here today.\\n\\nIn January, I adopted an 11 yo, 19 lbs chonker. I fell in love instantly. His last family returned him after 6 months with a bad case of fleas. He had been defleaed but came home with a slew of other health issues. By end of January after a lot of vet visits, he seemed to be on the mend. I knew what I was signing up for when I adopted a senior cat, but just didn\\'t realize the endless possibilities. Truly, I tell him every night before bed he\\'s my ride or die, and that\\'s about to be tested with this saga of the greatest love story ever told.\\n\\nEarly February, he starts coughing and stops pooping in his litterbox, despite me cleaning it daily. He\\'s still peeing in there, but seems cautious and runs out immediately. Even when he started pooping on the floor (thank God for wood floors), he\\'d run under my bed from it. That was the only time he\\'d go under my bed, otherwise he was cuddled up on or next to me. His medical chart from when I adopted him said he had issues with litterbox pooping- they suspected he was afraid of his last family\\'s other cat and it was behavioral, but something didn\\'t add up. He was fine with pooping in the litterbox for the first month after his kitty enema. I cleaned up his poop every other day and saw nothing out of the ordinary. He was starting to lose weight, which was good because as cute of a chonker as he is, it\\'s NOT healthy, folks. I stopped free feeding him, started feeding him scheduled wet food meals, and we had daily playtime to get him to a healthy weight.\\n\\nI bring him into the vet in February for the 6th time in a month and a half. He had half of his teeth removed before I adopted him. This resulted in an incision infection and an enema due to opiod constipation. This visit was for his cough. I even ask if he could have worms. The vet tells me, \"I know you\\'re trying to be a good pet owner, but he likely has allergies and it\\'s a behavioral issue. This might be something he has to live with. Come see me if his mucus turns brown\". I had been right about every single Dr. Google diagnosis up until this point, but whatever. I buy an air purifier, vacuum and clean regularly, change the bedding weekly- I already have an obsessive cleaning schedule, and COVID/quarantine has only allowed that the time to thrive. Ask any of my previous roommates and I am the cleanest person you\\'ll ever live with. Despite the cleaning, some coughing days were better than others.\\n\\nAll of a sudden end of last week, he starts coughing a lot less, and I start feeling like absolute shit. My best friend even makes a joke that I caught whatever my cat had. Sick, sick foreshadowing. \\n\\nWhen I read the article about the tiger in the Bronx catching COVID19, I was convinced we both had it. My chest was tight, frequent bathroom runs, just pure exhaustion, losing weight rapidly despite being quarantined for a month in a tiny studio- malnourished to the point my hair is falling out. I\\'m a mess. I guess it\\'s a good thing I got laid off 2 weeks ago, because the bathroom and I are very close friends these days. \\n\\nI wake up Monday morning to the pungent smell of my cat\\'s usual poop surprise on the wood floor. He\\'s such a kind cat to poop where it\\'s easy cleanup. That\\'s when I see them - worms crawling around EVERYWHERE. I\\'m gagging, take a little sample for the vet, and flush the rest. I Dr. Google the shit out of it and it is for SURE tapeworms. Then I read about the eggs. Let me remind you I change my sheets and wash my duvet cover weekly. I make my bed the second I get out of it and even vacuume my duvet cover. I RUN to inspect my bed- there are eggs EVERYWHERE. Little rice demons of hell that have been dropping from my poor cat\\'s bum for 3 months. I\\'m dry heaving at this point. I live in an old studio apartment and my bed is against a brick wall, so I get little grout crumble patches that I have to vacuume up pretty regularly. I remember feeling little patches of what I assumed one night was grout in my sheets, but fell asleep wine drunk and ignored it. When I tell you they were everywhere, I mean they were everywhere. My pillow, under my pillow- my cat and I fall asleep cuddling every night. Again, I love this cat too damn much.\\n\\nI call the vet and it is undoubtedly tapeworm. We suspect he\\'s had it since I adopted him. His prescription gets to me within a few hours. I also get flea medication and spray. I check him for flea dirt regularly and hadn\\'t seen anything, but better to be cautious. I bag all of my bedding, throw out half of what I own, vacuum every inch of this place for an hour, I\\'m on the fucking floor with my flashlight and  find a dead tapeworm under my couch, Swiffer, disinfect my couch, flip my mattress- like total mental breakdown. I give him his medication and his cough stops instantly. He hasn\\'t coughed once since Monday.\\n\\nThis has been one of my childhood phobias since I read that urban legend about the guy who starved himself then put a burger patty on his tongue and lured the tapeworm out until he could grab it from his mouth. I\\'m thinking about this story after giving my cat his meds when holy moly diarrhea. I look in the toilet bowl to 3 long strings floating on the sides that normally I would have flushed to sewage heaven without second thought, but they are undoubtedly tapeworms. My grown ass calls my mom and sobs while still sitting on the toilet in all of my wormy glory. I call and embarrassingly show the doctor, doctor undoubtedly tells me I too have tapeworm and writes me a prescription. He asks me if I want just tapeworm or a full deworming? I\\'m like wtf does that mean? He\\'s like, \"You\\'d be surprised how many parasites are living in you regularly. Just wait and see what you\\'re about to poop out\". I honestly just want to die at this point. \\n\\nMy cat and I are prescribed the same medication, obviously just different doses and different pricetags. His was $13 for two doses. Mine? $130 for one dose, 2 pills. That\\'s WITH my last month of insurance from my previous employer. I immediately receive a text that my prescription is on back order because of COVID. I\\'m trying to fall asleep that night on my couch without any blankets, when would you fucking guess it- my heat stops working. So now I\\'m just shivering on a small ass couch knowing there\\'s worms crawling around inside of me and eggs everywhere. I don\\'t sleep. \\n\\nI call the pharmacy when they open in tears asking when my meds are going to get there. Lucky me, they had just arrived. He asks me, \"Did you know your prescription is $130?\" I\\'m like, \"Uh no I\\'ve never had tapeworm, but I guess the price is irrelevant\". We both nervously laugh. I also haven\\'t had an in-person human interaction in a month because I\\'ve been self isolating alone and laid off due to COVID, so this is trying on soooo many levels.\\n\\nI order delivery for a big ass meal from my favorite restaurant because 1. I have no appetite because the thought of feeding the worms makes me want to die and I was hoping ordering from my favorite restaurant would entice me to eat. 2. Medication has to be taken with food. 3. I realize this is the last day  the calories don\\'t matter. Might as well enjoy it. \\n\\nI pick up my prescription, light a candle, call my best friend, we have a little virtual funeral for my worms and try to make light of the situation. I play the song I want played at my funeral (Hamburg Song by Keane, it\\'s beautiful). But it just keeps getting worse, y\\'all. My best friend hesitantly tells me he was telling his physical therapist about my worm saga. She recommended buying clove oil and rubbing it on my pink starfish. I\\'m like why? Apparently worms like to bite your butt on the way out, and clove oil prevents that. I hate everything at this moment. It\\'s like the different levels of hell. \\n\\nI take the pills and am reading the prescription pamphlet. It notes that you\\'ll experience random aches and pains while the worms are dying. Let me tell you- I felt every fucking worm dying as I lay blanketless on my couch in the fetal position. All of a sudden, I\\'m thinking about the worms and I can\\'t breathe. My throat is kind of itchy, and I\\'m thinking there are worms dying in my tonsils at this point or I got COVID at the pharmacy. I\\'m laying there in the fetal position, telling myself it\\'s just a panic attack. My cat decides to go pee at 2am, jumps out startled trailing pee all over the apartment. I know the medication says limit your alcoholic beverages, but I say fuck it and make a drink. I clean the pee and finally fall asleep for about 3 hours.\\n\\nI wake up bright and early to the smell of cat poop. Still half asleep, I searched his normal spots and couldn\\'t find any poops. He left it in the tub for me- a new spot- thanks, cat. Easy cleanup and no worms- I take it as a win. I flush it down the toilet, bleach the tub, and obsessively wash my hands. \\n\\nLet me tell you- my hands are bleeding from the amount of times I wash them between COVID and wormageddon. I look at myself in the mirror while scrubbing my raw hands and holy shit. My face is is swollen to the point I\\'m still surprised I can see out of my eyes. My tongue is flopping all over the place. I am having a severe allergic reaction to the tapeworm medication. That panic attack while falling asleep was actually an allergic reaction. \\n\\nI immediately video chat my doctor, he tells me to go get Benadryl immediately and writes me a steroid prescription. I get a call from their finance department on the brief walk to the pharmacy: $140 for that 5 minute virtual visit. I try to dispute the charge- she can\\'t do anything. I just flat out ask her: \"Can I just tell you about my shitty life then for $140?\". We talk for 5 minutes about how much my life sucks and she agrees. She was very nice about it, but still $140. She basically tells me that if I had waited a month to get tapeworm and almost die from the medication, the virtual visit would have been cheaper without insurance. Fucking love it and American healthcare. \\n\\nI cut my losses go back to the same pharmacy from the day before and they ask me what\\'s wrong. I lift up my glasses and they were like \"Ooooof- did you know you were allergic to this medication?\". At this point, I\\'m like \"WHY DO ANY OF YOU THINK I\\'VE HAD TAPEWORMS BEFORE?\" Truly, complete mental breakdown. I buy my medication, a box of wine, and $20 worth of candy to ease the pain.\\n\\nSo folks, here I am. Unemployed and alone during a pandemic, clenching my butt like never before, still haven\\'t pooped because I\\'m terrified of worm kisses on the way out, face still swollen shut, but I\\'m breathing fine. My cat is a new cat, so for that? I am grateful. I am 100% sure I will have PTSD from this experience. It is going to be a long, long, time before my cat and I snuggle regularly again, but I know we\\'ll get there and I still love him. Adopt senior pets regardless of this story, because 10/10- would still get worms again for him.\\n\\nWormageddon 2020 will not soon be forgotten. \\n\\nTL;DR My recently adopted cat gave us both tapeworm, I almost died from the meds, and this is my hell.\\n\\nEdit: I\\'ll come back and give more meaningful update, but I\\'m reading all of these comments over the phone, basking in the worst kind of Reddit fame with my best friend, and his smart ass says, \"Your tapeworm is going to come out of your butt and ask DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?\" \\n\\nBut really, y\\'all are too kind. So this happened a couple of days ago..\\n\\nHad a rash develop over the past few weeks and it was itching like crazy, thought at first it was just some kind of allergy from switching body washes lately. After changing back to my old wash and my rash didn\\'t showing any indication of subsiding, I went to visit a dermatologist. Anyways, turns out I have a skin condition called Pityriasis rosea, which isn\\'t actually serious and should go away on its own. So she perscribed me some corticosteroids for the itching and sent me on my way home. Anyone that has ever gotten an itch knows that there are few things more pleasant than scratching it. After showering (and before taking my medication), the rash was itching particularly strongly and I sat down on the toilet to dry my hair. I noticed that when the hot air from the dryer came in contact with my rash ( Rash was spread all over the back) it felt like scratching my back REAALLLYYY good. So naturally I took the hot dryer closer to my skin and voila, that shit felt close to an orgasm. Naturaly I decided to take it to the next logical level: Flopping the bishop while scratching my rash with the hot hair dryer (Yes I know this sounds mildy retarded). What ensued next was the most transending experience in my whole fucking life. I busted a nut so hard I started to see stars, my hole body started to tremble and I fucking fainted. My parents heard the thump of me falling on the floor from downstairs, and appearantly called for me a few times, my mother is a REAAAL worrier, so my dad broke down the bathroom door, where they found me laying like literally covered in a quarter cups worth of semen, my back all red from the hot air, and the hairdryer blowing at max speed all over the place. So yeah, my mother hasn\\'t looked me in the eye for like 2 days. FML\\n\\nTL;DR: Found out hot air from hairdryer works 50 times better than scratching with nails, decided I wanted to scratch and masturbate at the same time. Came so hard I went to narnia and back, fainted so hard on the toilet seat my dad had to tear down the bathroom door.\\n\\nI\\'m legit thinking of going living in the woods. lol\\n\\nEDIT: WOW I had no Idea this would blow up like this! Thanks for the golds, silvers and platinum kind strangers!\\n\\nPs: Am looking into becoming hair dryer sales guy now I thought it would be funny to put a Bluetooth speaker in the ceiling and play sounds of cats over it.  I found an eight hour video of cats meowing on YouTube that was perfect.\\n\\nI paired an old phone to the speaker, tossed the phone in a drawer of an empty desk, and tucked the speaker under a ceiling tile.  It was perfect.  You could only hear the cats if you listened real close.  It sounded like there was a cat in the ceiling, but you really couldn\\'t tell exactly where it was coming from.\\n\\nI went to my office, got busy with work, and forgot about it until I went to break.  I walked into the break room and several people were talking about the cat that must be in the ventilation system.  I chuckled to myself while I grabbed my coffee and made a loop through accounting department to see if there were any more people talking about the cats in the ceiling.  \\n\\nTo my horror, half the ceiling tiles were removed and there were two maintenance men on ladders looking for the cat.  They were real close to the speaker but hadn\\'t found it quite yet.  \\n\\nI just reversed out of there and went back to work.  They eventually found the speaker, and shortly after everyone got an email from the big boss reprimanding the guilty party and asking for any information on the culprit.  \\n\\nTLDR - I caused the entire accounting department to be shut down for 3 hours this morning by making them think there was a cat stuck in the ceiling.  \\nMy bad.\\n\\n\\nUpdate:\\n\\nA conspiracy theory emerged by the end of the day. \\n\\nSeveral of them don\\'t believe that it was a prank at all.  They think the maintenance people lied about it being a prank.  That management made it up to get people back to work, and that maintenance  is planning to set out traps and poison to kill it.  One person claimed they absolutely heard the cat yesterday, and I shit you not, a couple of them claim they still hear it. This is long so TLDR at the bottom.\\n\\nThis happened around 6 years ago when I was in 9th grade. I grew up not knowing a single thing about my dick or how to clean it. My parents never taught me anything about genitals and I apparently never asked, all I knew was that’s where the pee came out.\\n\\nSo one day in 9th grade biology our teacher was covering the male reproductive system that day and she got to a point where she mentioned that for uncircumcised makes the foreskin is supposed to retract over the head of the penis. I was pretty shocked because that’s certainly not how mine worked. By that time I was a daily meat beater and my foreskin could barely go back enough for me to see the entrance of the urethra!\\n\\nSo armed with my new knowledge about how my dick was *supposed* to work I went home and a few google searches led me to discover that I had a severe case of phimosis. So being the pragmatic young buck that I am I also google how to fix it. There were basically two options: either tell my parents and have them take me to a doctor for surgery or do stretching exercises. Not wanting to tell any of this to my parents or have someone come near my penis with a scalpel I opted for the latter option. I got some baby oil, the only lube available at the time other than my mom’s bottle of expensive extra virgin olive oil, and went to work.\\n\\nAfter about 4 hours of stretching I finally started making some progress! I could see a slightly bigger area now, not just the opening of the urethra like before. Everything was going great except for 1 thing: from the underside of my foreskin came the most pungent, musty, cheesy disgusting smell I’ve ever had the displeasure of smelling even to this day. It dawned on me that my penis had truly not been cleaned at all in my entire life up to that point. I kept stretching over the course of a few days and I started to notice a thick, gooey greenish-brown sludge seeping from under the foreskin as I stretched. Some quick googling taught me that this was *smegma*, also known as Dick Cheese. \\n\\nI cleaned it off whenever it seeped out during my stretching exercises and as much as it disgusted me everything was still going fine. That was about to change real fucking fast.\\n\\nSo this was about 10 days into my stretching and I’d gotten my foreskin about to the half way mark. I was getting very excited to finally have a normal full functioning penis so I got very impatient and I decided I’d try to force it all the way back that day I lubed and got to work, I pulled it back as far as it would go and pulled it some more. I pulled it till I couldn’t bear the pain anymore. I did this over and over again for around 3 hours until I somehow managed to pull it almost to where it was almost over the entirety of the head of my penis. I got way too excited and despite the pain I gave it one big yank and I felt the foreskin pop over the back of the glans. It hurt like hell but I was just so relieved that I didn’t care. I opened my eyes and my heart skipped several beats. The entire lower half of the head of my penis down to the area behind it was caked with thick brown/green smegma. That was now mixing with the blood that was now seeming out of where I tore the top part of my foreskin when I yanked it over the glans. I freaked and squeezed the area to stop the bleeding and that only made the pain worse. It eventually stopped and then I had to chip away at the smegma caked unto my penis. I eventually got it all off after half an hour of scrubbing. I was still hurting but I was finally done. I got the foreskin all the way back over the head of my penis. I thought that was it. I tried rolling it back over the head but it wouldn’t budge so I just left it.I completely ignored the fact that the forcing the foreskin back all the way would constrict all the blood flow to the head of my penis. You know how a balloon looks when you fill it with water and tie it? That’s how my penis looked. I went to bed, went to school the next day in severe pain and acted like everything was fine.\\n\\nWhen I got home I was still in major pain so I decided I’d check on it. I undressed in the shower and looked down at it. The first thing I saw were the blisters. Two huge brown puss filled blisters; one on the right side and the other on the underside of the glans. The next thing I noticed was the fact that my dick was now seemingly turning some shade of white. I’m a black guy.\\n\\nI realized that if I didn’t find a way to get my foreskin back over my glans then it was probably going to shrivel up and fall off. I lubed up once more and began forcing my foreskin back over the glans. This was made even more difficult because of the two big blisters in the way. I kept trying to force it back over and I put too much pressure on one of the blisters and it broke causing pus to leak out all over my penis and fingers.  My penis was on fire at this point and I was holding back tears but I kept pushing until I felt it pop back over the glans. Judging from the liquid that seeped out afterwards and the extra jolt of pain I felt I guess the second blister popped too. Once again I left it and fucking went to bed. \\n\\nI checked 3 days later and my penis went back to its original color. I rolled back the foreskin again and cleaned where the blisters were and within 3 weeks I was pretty much ok. My foreskin was still tight and I do think constricting my glans with the opening of my foreskin for a whole day probably made me lose a tiny bit of sensation down there but hey at least my dick is clean!\\n\\nAlso please for the love of god teach your kids about their body. Even if they aren’t as stupid as I was don’t take that risk lol\\n\\nTL;DR; had severe phimosis, did stretching exercises to fix it, forced it back because I got impatient, had to clean 15 years worth of smegma off my penis and ended up tearing my foreskin, couldn’t get it back over the glans cause it was too tight, left it there for a day, dick turned white and blistered due to the opening of the foreskin squeezing the area where the glans meets the shaft, forced it back over and popped both blisters in the process, most traumatic experience of my life. \\n\\nEDIT: So I didn’t expect this to blow up like this lol thanks for the silver, gold and platinum! \\n\\nSo while I’m happy everyone seems to have enjoyed the story, I’d like to clear up something. This post was not meant to turn people against leaving their kids uncircumcised. Circumcision removes a lot of the sensitive nerve endings in the penis and leads to a decrease in the amount of pleasure one feels from sex.  Rather, I’d like people to take this as a warning of what can happen when you avoid teaching your children about taking care of themselves. \\n\\nFor those of you who are suffering from a tight foreskin,  my number one recommendation is to see a doctor. Don’t be stupid like me and put yourself through this hell. They have creams and other medications that can make this a much easier process. For those of you who aren’t old enough to see a doctor on your own, then you have to tell your parents. Believe me it’s not as awkward that you think. Don’t risk permanently harming yourself just because of a few seconds of awkwardness between you and the two people who know what every inch of your naked body looks like.  So today I sold my bitcoin I bought 2 years ago I spent like $100 on the investment or something, I cashed it out at a bitcoin atm and brought it home the first thing I did to celebrate was buy some edibles. I buy some edibles eat a whole brownie and am out of it, I order some pizza and take some money from my wad and put it in a pile on the table next to me total was like 20 so I put 23.\\n\\nSince I\\'m high af the pizza delivery girl knocks I grab the wad of all the money not the $23 stack. I give it to her and she starts crying she keeps saying are you sure you dont know how much this is going to help me. Freaked out and high I say okay and just rush inside.\\n\\nRight now after waking up being passed out I realize what I\\'ve done, gave away my bill money for this month lol.\\n\\nTL;DR - I tipped my pizza delivery driver $1100 while high on brownie edibles by accident and have no money to pay for my bills now\\n\\nEdit: Thanks for all the nice comments and the reddit gold kind stranger. I just woke up and this post just blew up. I could never call the pizza place and ask for the money back, with how happy it made the women and the fact it was my own dumb mistake it just wouldn\\'t feel right in my head, I would rather be late on my bills and figure anything else out then do that.\\n\\nI just want to say thank you to u/misterchief117 who helped me out in a insane way, I really don\\'t deserve how nice some people in this world are. I know Reddit is going to give me a lot of hate for this. This morning I was super horny and really wanted hook up with a local guy to give him bj. So I got to talking with a guy and even though he was a lot older (like late 30s-mid 40s), he had a great bod and a great dick. So I said what the hell and invited him to my hotel room. After 45min to an hour of fun, I thought I’d never see this dude again because I’m flying home this afternoon (right now).\\n\\nWrong. I went to the gate when they started boarding. Guess who was pre-boarding with his wife and children? You guessed it. To make matters worse, they are just a couple rows from me and I can hear all their conversations. I’m in the plane right now and he keeps texting. I am saving screen shots in case I need them in the future. I’m sitting here wondering how he was able to get away from his family that long...he was staying at the same hotel, which now just dawned on me because he made it to my room super fast. \\n\\nThis is so uncomfortable.\\n\\nTL;DR: Hooked up with a guy at my airport hotel this am. Turns out he’s married, and he and his family are on my flight home.\\n\\nEdit: I gave him my phone number for trading texts and pics early this am. He texted me just now telling me he found me on IG and FB so he must have searched with my phone number somehow. Now I definitely need leverage with the screen shots to tell him to stop contacting me.\\n\\nEdit 2: A) I’m male. B) The wife does not know. He texted me in the plane asking me to keep quiet. And then also wanted to stay in touch and text me later because he now knows we live in the same city (and yes you bet I saved the screen shot - saved it on the phone, on the cloud, on emails to myself) C) I knew what his dick looked like because of dick picks and bathroom mirror selfies\\n\\nJust wanted to respond to popular questions.\\n\\nEdit 3: Hope you saw the screen shot, you know who you guys are. :-) This happened today.\\n\\nI have one FU in my life which I find funny and wanted to share. I, being an absolute amateur at reddit with only one successful post in two years, tried to strategize and save it for my cake day.\\n\\nClever, isn\\'t it?\\n\\nSo i posted it. It got autoremoved for a good reason.\\n\\nI fixed it and posted it again, it got autoremoved for an even better reason I hadn\\'t known about.\\n\\nSo I made a post about failing to post to TIFU. Guess what: It was removed for yet another reason I hadn\\'t known about.\\n\\nI fixed the failed post about failing to post, posted it, and it was downvoted immediately. \\n\\nAnd suddenly I was overly afraid to break another rule I just learned about: that you are not allowed to republish banned content, which might result in me being permanently banned from r/tifu\\n\\nSo i quickly deleted it, like a teenager caught in an awkward situation. seeing only afterwards that I had two friendly comments already.\\n\\nI am 47 years old, BTW.\\n\\nI give up posting to reddit.\\n\\nEDIT thank you kind Internet strangers for making this such an enjoyable cake day experience! and thank you a lot for my first ever award thingies!\\n\\nTL;DR I am too stupid to post to reddit. To begin, I\\'m a female BDSM practitioner. I enjoy it, and I won\\'t apologize. (Edit: That came out harsh. I\\'m Sorry)\\n\\nMy husband often cuffs and whips me, and on Wednesday we had a pretty hardcore session. He put these big leather cuffs on me, but failed to take off my Apple Watch. I didn\\'t realize that if you hold the dial down, it automatically dials 911. \\n\\nSo we get into it, and he\\'s spanking me and I\\'m pulling on my restraints, and the restraints hold down the button. Hes smacking me pretty good, and suddenly I hear from my watch \"Ma\\'am, I hear what appears to be hitting and screaming. We are sending someone to you. Hold tight.\" \\n\\n\"Did you call 911???\" My husband asked, \"tell them it was an accident!!\"\\n\\nSo I tell the 911 operator that it was just an accident, and she says is your name [She said my name here]? And I say yes... And she says \"we have your address from our database, and we\\'re sending someone over now. Im sorry, but we hear a male voice telling you what to say, and this sounds like coercion on our end, so we are obligated to make sure you\\'re safe.\\n\\nI said okay thank you, and I hung up.\\n\\n\"The police are coming.\"\\n\\nShit. I\\'m literally covered in bruises and welts, the police are coming to check on my well being. Within a few minutes there\\'s a stern knock at the door. We put our clothes on and come to the door, and the police take my husband outside, separating us from communication.\\n\\nI calmly explain that it was an accident and we were just having really crazy sex. I didn\\'t mention the spanking.\\n\\nApparently my husband did. Another police officer comes in and asks about our BDSM contract. \"He told you about our contract?\"\\n\\n\"He felt it best to come clean about your extracurricular activities tonight, and thought the contract would possibly show State of Mind.\"\\n\\nI go get our contract and showed it to the officers. After a mortifying few more minutes explaining that he was only smacking my ass and thighs, they believe us and tell us to disable the 911 feature on the Apple Watch if we\\'re going to do that again.\\n\\nTL;DR TIFU by accidentally calling 911 during a heavy BDSM session and they heard me screaming and sent the police.\\n\\nEdit: iWatch doesn\\'t exist. <3\\n\\nEdit: this post is not Deja Vu. Yes. I posted it 2 days ago, and mods took it down, asking me to repost it today. The literally hundreds of people asking about if they saw this before need to read this edit. They took it down because this happened on Wednesday, and according to the rules of the subreddit, sexual content is not allowed except for on weekend, so they asked me to repost it today.\\n\\nEDIT: Holy shit. Thanks for the gold!! And the front page. I\\'m freaking out a little because contrary to the trolls, yes this happened. My wife posted earlier today on LA about this. Not using my main because my FIL knows it and I\\'m not quite ready to tell him about this.\\n\\nI went to work today and turned my phone off as usual. I had almost 30 missed texts and calls from my pregnant wife when I turned it on. Most of them were asking how I could do this. I had no clue what she was talking about. She didn\\'t answer any of my calls back.\\n\\nI got home and she was packing up to leave. I\\'ll admit it, I cried. A lot. Had no clue what was happening or what I did. Finally, it comes out that I texted her that I wanted a divorce. She showed me the text and I immediately realize what happened.\\n\\nThis morning, a free standing mirror for our bedroom was delivered. I texted her \"the new mirror came in! I\\'m going to try to put it together but I may need your help later\". I had trouble putting it together and eventually gave up. I texted her, \"this isn\\'t working, and at this point I think I need to just give up\". Apparently, the first text didn\\'t go through, just the second one. So my pregnant wife panicked for a few hours while I was off thinking everything was great. She even called a divorce lawyer.\\n\\nThings are fine now but she\\'s still crying off and on. She told me we can laugh about it tomorrow.\\n\\nTL;DR Accidentally told my wife that things weren\\'t working, she almost left me.\\n\\nEdit: Wow, this blew up. To address a few things that came up in the comments:\\n\\n\\\\-I usually work from home unless I need to meet with clients. I don\\'t always tell my wife when my client meetings are, because she\\'s usually at work anyway. That\\'s why she didn\\'t know I was at work yesterday. I\\'m not allowed to have my phone on at work until my wife is 30 weeks. If my phone goes off, I could lose my job, and our health insurance.\\n\\n\\\\-My wife has an anxiety disorder and had to stop taking her meds because of the pregnancy. That\\'s why she had the reaction she did.\\n\\n\\\\-My comment about my wife being forgiving was a joke. Neither of us is mad at the other. This was just a series of misunderstandings that snowballed. We\\'re fine. I posted this so people could laugh at our misfortune. No need to psychoanalyze my wife or PM me about divorce. We are fine.\\n\\n\\\\-and no, we haven\\'t put the mirror together yet. We weren\\'t really in a \"home improvement\" mood last night. This weekend, I was in one of my best friend’s weddings. The bride, my friend, is diabetic and forgot her insulin when we went to the church, so technically, diabetes is the villain of this story.\\n\\nNo problem. I volunteered to go back to her house to pick it up. I like a mission. Me against diabetes. After a morning of bridal stuff, my adrenal glands were more than happy to kick some dust off.\\n\\nThe bride says the back door is unlocked, so I dash to her house, drifting the corners (in my mind), finding the apex in the road. The back door is not unlocked. No doors are opened, but I am NOT taking the L on this.\\n\\nAll of us bridesmaids had gotten ready at her house earlier, and one of the other bridesmaids was leaning out her window on the 2nd floor smoking. I gaze up at her window, praying that it’s still unlocked. I know this house. I went to high school with the bride, snuck out of that window onto the roof, and clambered down the tree beside the house many times.\\n\\nOnly this time, I am in a strapless, tight, mermaid style dress. Driving a stick in this constricting skirt was challenge enough. There is no way on God’s green earth that I can climb a tree.\\n\\nIts barely above freezing, but this is a DefCon 2 situation.\\n\\nI’m in the back yard, and there is only one house that can see me. I accept the crazy-low odds that the grandparents that live next door will notice me. Decidedly incorrect assumption because apparently, Gramps has assigned himself the position of overwatch.\\n\\nI kick off my heels, sling off my jacket (it’s barely above freezing), and toss the Morticia Addams-style bridesmaid dress over the fence. I pat my old friend, the tree, and begin to climb. I’m sure I sloth-climbed it, but the adrenaline pulsing through my veins has me convinced that I ninja warriored that shit.\\n\\nThe window is unlocked\\\\*\\\\*. Oorah\\\\*\\\\*!\\n\\nOnce I open it, I ungracefully fall into the room from the roof.  I don’t care because the distinctly male movie announcer voice in my head is sexily broadcasting the trailer for the movie I’m acting out. The crowd cheers when my icicle toes hit the hardwood floors. *I’m killing it*.\\n\\nThe room looks like a girl bomb exploded. Curlers, hairdryers, make-up bags, and clothes cover every square inch of the carpet. I super kung fu hop over the piles to the dresser where she said her insulin bag would be. It’s not there.\\n\\nI rifle through the piles, shaking like a scared dog from the cold. Nope. To the bathroom. Nope. A massive rock drops into my stomach when I can’t find her insulin. The clock is ticking. I launch down the stairs, two at a time and run through the house as my eyes scan every surface.\\n\\nI find it on the kitchen counter, a full floor away from where she thought she left it.\\n\\nBooyow! I’m back in the game. I shotgun pump my arm and grab the bag.\\n\\nI make sure I can lock the kitchen door from the inside. I mentally check-yep, I left all of my stuff outside.\\n\\nI step into the garage, shutting the door behind me. As I’m jiggling the locked doorknob, I hear the *Woop Woop* of a police car.\\n\\nI slowly turn and do some weird half raise of my hands. There are two…TWO cops in the driveway. All official and stern-looking. In a split second, I flash on images. I’m in the back of the police car, handcuffed, search warrants are getting issued. I see the courtroom, a stern judge and an unforgiving jury.  In a moment of catastrophic cognitive dissonance, I swear I heard my brain misfire.\\n\\nThe only thing that zaps me back to reality is that I kid you not- my boobs are two frozen ice-cones. I’m going to have the pleasure of explaining this shit-show to the officers while wearing nothing but my fancy thong and lacy, strapless bra because genius me didn’t want panty lines… and my hot-ass guy will be wearing a tux to the wedding. Nuff said.\\n\\nI could have vaporized on the spot from the humiliation as the officers approach me.\\n\\nI don’t even know what I said. I virtually shoved the bag of insulin at the older cop and vomited out the preposterous details of this Texas-sized oof that landed me in my skivvies, coming out of a house that I technically broke into.\\n\\nThey try to keep a straight face, but then I start to laugh. It begins as a small embarrassed chuckle, but then it takes on a life of its own, commandeering all of my self-control and flinging it into the icy wind with the ashes of my dignity. I howl. Tears run down my face and I shoot strangled, inhuman sounds at them. I can make no sound other than drawn-out vowels. God, it’s embarrassing.\\n\\nThe cops are trying to ask me questions, and instead, they get Mutley the dog. All I can do is wheeze, or tear and shake from the cold.  Finally, I beg them to let me put my clothes on.\\n\\nOne gallantly swings his arm to tell me to proceed to the back yard to recover my assortment of clothing cringingly clinging to the fence. They are gentlemen about it as I jump and shimmy into this hell-contraption of a bridesmaid’s dress.\\n\\nThey ask me if there is anyone that I can call from the family to confirm the story.\\n\\nI call the bride. She doesn’t pick up.\\n\\nI call the bride’s mom. She doesn’t pick up.\\n\\nI call the love of my life. He picks up on the first ring. God, I love that man. He doesn’t know why I left the church but immediately goes into solve-this-shit-fast mode. He gets the Bride’s dad. It gets sorted.\\n\\nMy guy is waiting in the parking lot when I pull up. Panic rolls across his face when he sees me, thinking I have been crying. I laugh the rest of my make-up off with him when I tell him the story. We’re getting married soon, and I think the bride should have to perform a commensurate task to climbing a tree in freezing weather in her underwear. I’m definitely taking suggestions.\\n\\nThis all happened in a decently small town. This story has ripped through the gossip mill like Taco Bell through the colon. My oldest brother is apparently friends with the “young” cop that I could never make myself look in the eye. Yep- never living this down, and I’m never more grateful to have moved away.\\n\\nAlso, LPT- I’m an idiot, so maybe you all know this, but don’t hand your phone to the police. Put the call on speaker or show the text from your hand. Do not physically place your property in the care of the police. Advice from a law student who was more than happy to lecture me for 20 minutes at the reception.\\n\\nTLDR; Title says it all. Insulin is a life-saving drug, and at least for one day, I kicked diabetes ass. You gotta do what you gotta do, even if it means being a streaking, Tarzan cat-burglar.\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks, everyone. It\\'s been a fantastic ride. Quick link to the [r/asklegal](https://www.reddit.com/r/asklegal/) expert review of whether you should/should not hand your phone to the police: [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/f1ykrz/do\\\\_you\\\\_give\\\\_the\\\\_police\\\\_the\\\\_right\\\\_to\\\\_search\\\\_your/](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/f1ykrz/do_you_give_the_police_the_right_to_search_your/)  And NO- I will not send pics. I (37 M) was at the park with my kids yesterday and I tell my youngest (2 F) how impressed I am with how fast her climbing is getting.  I tell her she’s almost as fast as her older sister.\\n\\nMy oldest daughter (6 F) is unimpressed that I\\'m not complimenting her so she jumps down from the climbing frame to talk to me.\\n\\n\\'Dad, you have got to stop saying racist things all the time\\' she says to me loud enough for all the other parents in my immediate vicinity to hear.\\n\\nI gulp and look around feeling awkward.  The stares of judgement from the other parents bearing down on me.\\n\\n\\'What do you mean honey, what have I ever said that was racist?\\'\\n\\n\\'You always turn everything into a race and I don\\'t like it\\' she replies.\\n\\nBless her little innocent heart\\n\\nTLDR:  My daughter accuses me of being racist in front of other parents at a park.  Turns out she thinks racist means turning everything into a race. I’ve been living in this house for the past 11 years. In my bedroom there’s a ceiling fan that I always have on to try and make my room colder. My room has always been insanely hot compared to the rest of the house and I never understood why.\\n\\nFlash forward to today when I’m talking to a friend that said they found out their fan can switch directions to heat the room in the winter. I immediately realized my fuck up. When I got home I took a closer look at the fan and hiding by the light is a little black switch. I hit the switch and what do you know, my room is about 10 degrees colder in minutes. I’ve been sleeping in a sauna for the past 11 years and had no idea. Every day in the summer waking up sweaty was because of a tiny black switch.\\n\\nTLDR: My ceiling fan has been spinning the wrong direction and heating my room for 11 sweaty years Obligatory this happened about 5 hours ago but I seen the email 30 minutes ago while taking a shit and finally piecing the puzzle together. We have been waiting for our debit cards for 2 weeks. We started a new bank account and had all of our money go into it besides a little bit we get put on a pre pay card. Turns out this online bank does not send out your debit card until you make a deposit (hit a week ago). I am sure it said that somewhere so that is on us. \\n\\nAnyway we have been spreading the money we had super thin, and we finally reached a point the we are going to try to Venmo or Paypal again. We tried them early in the week and it would not connect to the other card for some reason. \\n\\nMy wife get everything set up while I am playing PS4, hits transfer and sends a test 50 bucks, it worked! So this is were I come in, I said you should have sent more. So I take the phone from her and Send $225 on Venmo and jokingly write  \"Sex?\" in the message. Error can not process this transaction, next I get a email saying my account has violated terms of service and it is frozen.\\n\\nTLDR: We finally found a way to transfer money while we were waiting on our debit cards, I fucked it up by writing \"sex?\" in the message to my wife. Now my account is frozen and we are back to not having our money.\\n\\nEdit: It was a brand new account, I have never had to use Venmo before. So had I been verified, it probably would not have been an issue.\\n\\nUpdate: Kind of anti climatic but debit cards came in today so we are saved. Still have not heard from venmo, so Kanye shrug. Peace out reddit was a blast. For those of you who don\\'t know, a Menstural cup is a soft & flexible medical grade silicone cup that you can leave in for up to 12hrs to collect the period blood and pour out. As you can imagine, a full cup has a fair amount of blood. This is important for later.\\n\\nThis morning at 5am, I felt the need to go to the toilet. I noticed that a little blood had spilled out so I knew it was over time to empty my cup. This usually doesn\\'t happen to me, but I guess overnight I had more blood than usual.\\n\\nGroggy at 5am with the lights off, I take my cup out and dump it into the toilet. It was messy, and I finally discovered that I had an accident with how much blood came out. I chucked my cup in the sink next to me ready to clean everything up, but at this moment, my boyfriend peeks into the bathroom to see if I\\'m okay and what I\\'m doing awake.\\n\\nFrom his perspective, he just sees blood all over my hands and in the sink. The lights were off and he just can see me from the flash on my phone. It looked like a horror scene.\\n\\nHe freaked out and fainted at the door. Me, being concerned without thought, jumped up to aid my boyfriend who had just collapsed on the floor without a second thought.\\n\\nI then instantly realised I had blood all over my hands, and now all over him and the floor. He wakes up a moment later, freaking out not knowing why there is blood everywhere. \\n\\nI explained it to him and was left with a shocked boyfriend and a literal bloody mess I had to clean up at 5am.\\n\\nTL;DR I emptied my period cup in the dark at 5am and my boyfriend thought the blood on my hands was from some horror injury and fainted. (Names changed for the sake of the post) So this took place maybe half an hour ago, and to be honest there\\'s still a chance there will be some kickback for this today. I (25M) work in a call centre, and am doing so for the duration of this pandemic while I wait to find out whats happening about going back to university, its no career but its a pretty nice job with some decent people and its easy, all we do really is facilitate switches for people looking for better deals on household stuff, usually their internet provider or supplier of gas/electricity etc. We have agents in the field who make sales, then call us for verification with the customer, simple right?\\n\\nNot today. See, usually its company policy not to do call-backs, nobody wants annoying call-centre calls right? So unless the customer specifically requests a scheduled call-back, we just don\\'t do them. I had a customer 2 days ago looking for a pretty pricey internet switch, going from some basic setup to a full TV/Phone/Internet package, the works, all the channels, anytime calls to numbers including international, 500+ mbps wifi, and it came to over £100 a month. I inform the customer, who\\'s an impatient sounding guy, that because of the price increase he\\'ll need to have a quick credit check run on him and it\\'ll mean the call takes a little longer. The guy gets all pissed about being busy and saying he \"can\\'t waste all afternoon on the phone to some call-centre\" so would it be alright if I called him after the weekend to go through it then. Seemed straightforward enough...\\n\\nThis is pretty common, people are always up for the sale until they realise they\\'ll need to spend more than 1 whole minute on the phone, but I scheduled the call anyway and asked if there was a specific time he wanted me to call, he says any time is fine and follows with \"If Emily answers, just ask her for me, she\\'ll make sure I get the phone\" and gave me a home-phone number. Fast forward to today, and I make a grave error.\\n\\nSee, the application I had from the customer had his home phone number already filled in, which it turns out was NOT the same number he\\'d given me for today\\'s call back. I called the number I thought was correct, and a woman answers. I say without thinking; \"Oh hi, I\\'m calling for Steve to confirm his broadband switch, we spoke the other day? You must be Emily!\" .....cue uncomfortable pause. She says  \"This is Steve\\'s wife, Amanda. What do you mean I \"must\" be Emily?\"\\n\\nI apologised, and said \"I\\'m so sorry, when I spoke to him the other day he said if an Emily answered to just ask for Steve?\" And she just goes \"I fucking knew it, I fucking KNEW IT.\" and slammed the phone down. After checking the application against the post-it note i\\'d jotted some info down on the other day, I realised Steve must have given me the number for where he was going to be today, and i\\'d instead called his unsuspecting wife at home. Nobody\\'s called in to my workplace yet, but if they do I don\\'t think they\\'ll be happy\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR Customer gave me a different number to his own for a call-back, and I accidentally called his wife and revealed his infidelity\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUPDATE! Well fUCK, angry Steve just called my workplace, and has achieved nothing but making himself look like an ever bigger fucking dipshit than he already has, also for the record, Steve was always a dick who can die in a hole, and deserves all he gets, the reason for the TIFU was because I was worried about my job)  So I haven\\'t worked here very long, and am still learning things about company policy, and it turns out that when an application is put through by an agent, it MUST be the applicants own details, according to what they provide the agent. So I was only technically allowed to call the wife anyway, not Emily\\'s home number as he gave me. If he\\'d wanted the call to a different number, he would have had to have a new application submitted with revised details, it wasn\\'t enough to just give me a different number over the phone, so my job is safe (phew) however my manager isn\\'t happy and i\\'m getting a write-up, but I can live with that, they don\\'t mean much and i\\'ve never had one til now, always on time and have taken overtime voluntarily etc. ANYWAY, this guy phones up and before saying anything else, leads the call with one of my colleagues, who by the way, is a teenage girl in what I think is her first job, and he says \"Put me on with the little f\\\\*cking c\\\\*nt who thought it would be funny to call my wife earlier after I EXPLICITLY told him not too\"\\n\\nObviously the poor girl was confused, and looked about to ask the room for a manager asap, I immediately piped up and said \"Is it Mr X from \\\\*insert location\\\\*??\" and she confirmed, so I got her to transfer the call to my desk ASAP, Steve comes on the line and goes \"I bet you think you\\'re well f\\\\*cking funny you little pr\\\\*ck, put your manager on the phone and see if you\\'re so smart when you lose your job\"  So in my most sarcastic, overcompensating cutesy phone voice ever, I just say \"Of course sir, let me just transfer you to someone who can help\" then put him on hold for 20 minutes hoping it would wind him up even more while I found my manager and told him about the whole situation, he explained what i\\'d said above that I wasn\\'t technically in the wrong from a legal standpoint, and then my poor team leader had to quickly explain to Steve that he didn\\'t have a legal claim but that we\\'re sorry for the distress caused (sucky I know, but its a business after all) and now hopefully Steve\\'s evening culminates in his entire life being ruined. I got a disciplinary write-up for it but its over now, sorry for the wall of text but thanks for the awards!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUPDATE 2: For those wondering about the disciplinary, it was a formality and was the lowest possible level write-up my company can give, it was given as a formality because of disruption to the office (the girl Steve called was upset and it became a whole thing) He argued that I still made a mistake but that ultimately I am in no trouble over it, he also cited on the write up that leaving him on hold for so long just to wind him up was spiteful and petty, which, yeah, but Steve deserved it so it be like that\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUpdate 3: Not a continuation of the story, but thanks so much for the /insane/ amount of awards, (I didn\\'t even know an argentinium award was a thing) I\\'m glad this story has given you guys as much joy and faith in karma as it has my colleagues and I today, it\\'s spiralled to become the talking point of the whole office today and has been a bit of a scandal! Your support over my write-up is touching, but I won\\'t challenge it, hopefully before long i\\'ll be on to better things and this will just be a funny memory! This has even somehow birthed its own subreddit?? To the creator of r/TodaySteveFuckedUp, a special thanks 😆Thanks again for so much love, you Reddit bunch are the best x For context I’m a bank teller at one of the biggest banks in the U.S. This is also by far the highest paying job I’ve ever had as I only just graduated high school.\\n\\nThis dude who looked to be on the older side came in and he wanted to know why his debit card kept declining. So I pulled up his account history and there was literally pages upon pages of online purchases. The gag? Every single one of the purchases was OnlyFans. I guess that he subscribed to many many pages......and the craziest part was that they were over the last few days directly after he got paid so he got a bunch of money then blew it all on OnlyFans subscriptions!\\n\\nWhen I saw the account history I pretended to cough because I had the biggest urge to laugh but I managed to hold it in. I asked him if he had online banking or if he’d managed to look at his account history recently & he said no. I offered to print it out for him and he said yes please. When I handed the printouts to him, he just said ahhhh. And I came so close to laughing again but I managed to hold it in and be professional. Then I asked if he made those purchases and he just dejectedly said yes. And. I. Giggled. I couldn’t help it. He gave me this weird look & left. Afterwards I had to excuse myself to the bathroom and laughed it all out of my system.\\n\\nI guess he called in to complain because after I came from my lunch break my manager called me into his office and now we’ve scheduled a call for HR tomorrow. I’m probably pretty fucked..\\n\\nTL;DR - laughed at a guy when I saw his bank account history was full of OnlyFans subscriptions and I’m prolly gonna lose my job for it\\n\\nUpdate: wow thanks a lot for all your really nice messages. I just got done meeting with HR and I did exactly what you guys said, I took full responsibility for what happened. My manager asked why it was funny and I explained what OnlyFans is and the HR lady burst into laughter. They just let me off with a verbal warning and they said they appreciate the fact that I took responsibility but that I should try better controll my laughter next time, which is definitely fair enough. I’m just glad I still have my job, thanks for the advice from all the lovely redditors and the supportive PM’s that i received :) it really helped cause I was so anxious about being fired haha but thanks y’all :) So my girlfriend and I are in Atlantic City for two nights, our first vacation of any sort since COVID-19 started.  We made reservations tonight for outdoor poolside dining at Gordon Ramsay Steak at the Harrah’s. We were there last year when things were normal and were lucky this was one of the few restaurants open and with good outdoor dining (the Morton’s Steakhouse has tables set up at the valet parking area at Caesar’s - we didn’t go through with that reservation lol).  \\n\\nAs such, I figured I’d splurge and get some Wagyu beef. Well, they had real deal Japanese A5 Kobe on the menu - and it was cheaper than American Wagyu! The Kobe was only $35 for 4 oz instead of $80 for 8 oz of Wagyu. So I’m a big guy, I’m hungry, so I order 12 oz of Kobe.  \\n\\nThe steak was amazing.  I’m in my 40s and only had Wagyu before in my life, just twice.  I had never had real deal Kobe.  It was like nothing else you’ll ever have.  Melt in your mouth delicious.  We also ordered a couple of sides, appetizers, and my girlfriend had Chef Ramsay’s famous beef Wellington for the first time ever.  All in all an amazing meal and we were glad we could support the restaurant and it’s staff during these challenging times.  And I still couldn’t believe Kobe was cheaper than Wagyu!  \\n\\nOr so I thought. I had to read the menu again when the bill came, because for 2 people, the bill was over $600.00!!!  \\n\\n\\nTurns out the Japanese A5 was $35 **per ounce** with a 4 oz minimum purchase size, not $35 for 4 oz.\\n\\nSo, TL;DR, [today i fucked up by accidentally ordering, and eating, a $420.00 steak](https://www.imgur.com/a/M2kZzuL).   \\n\\nEdit:  I wish Chef Ramsay was there to come out and call me a donut for fucking this up lol. Throwaway for reasons.\\nTL;DR at the bottom.\\n\\nSo this was more of a FU that happened quite a while ago which only just caught up to me a few weeks ago, so also not today.\\n\\nAbout 11 months ago I moved into a new house as a temporary sort of thing until I could get the money together to sort something out properly, I was hoping to have already moved out by this point. On my second day after I’d finished unpacking I decided to break the house in with a nice acid trip, I’d brought some with me that I’d recently bought but not had the chance to use yet.\\n\\nThings were going well with the trip but then it seemed to be getting really intense and I quickly realised that the tabs were much stronger than I had been told they were, and I thought being locked up in the unfamiliar house wasn’t helping me relax. So I figured the best thing to do to relax would be to go for a stroll because I was starting to get pretty overwhelmed at that point. \\n\\nSo I left the house to start my walk and my next door neighbour happened to be just arriving at the same time. It’s a street of tightly packed terraced houses so next door’s door is about one meter away from mine. I’d not met anybody on my street yet and didn’t realise this was a friendly tight-knit community where people talk to each other. She said something along the lines of “hello nice to meet you, my name’s (her name), are you new to the area?”\\n\\nSo basically I do this thing sometimes when people try to sell me things on the street etc where I pretend I can’t speak English. I remember a few words from my GCSE French so I just say some nonsense sentences and then people usually leave me alone. In the state I was in this conversation seemed like it would be way too intense for me and French just sort of came to me as my default response to the situation. My exact words were “je voudrais une boulangerie” (one of my favourite lines to use) and I shrugged my shoulders a bit with a weak smile. She pretty much just left me to it after that and I got on my way. I did my walk and got home about two hours later, I was tripping majorly so the walk ended up taking a lot longer than it needed to. When I got home though my next door neighbour was stood in her doorway talking to another neighbour who was stood outside. I tried to keep my head down because I couldn’t handle any more human interaction but she waved at me and said “bonjour”, so I instinctively returned the bonjour and got inside my house as fast as possible. When I got in I started freaking out straight away because I realised that I’d just become French and now two of the neighbours think I can’t speak any English. The next day when I woke up I realised the best thing I could do (as an Englishman) was just live with the lie for the rest of my short stay in this house to avoid the excruciating embarrassment of having pretended to be French for seemingly no reason. \\n\\nFast forward 10 months, I still live here, and at this point I’m in DEEP. My life on this street is a web of lies. I’ve perfected my French accent and over the course of 10 months French Me has learnt a decent amount of English so he can hold disjointed conversation.\\nI’d gotten to know the neighbours pretty well and I was the nice quirky French guy on the street. I didn’t let the lie slip ever, because every day and every conversation I had just meant that it would be even worse if anyone ever discovered I wasn’t French. If I had friends come over (I don’t have many so it wasn’t too bad) they knew to never speak to the neighbours because of my strange situation. Most of them found it amusing, at least. \\n\\nThings were going okay and I wasn’t too worried about being exposed anymore because I’d gotten so used to it. I’m not home that much and when I am I rarely leave the house for any reason so I only had to do it for maybe 5 minutes a day when I was out on my street. If anything it was a nice way to spice up my day when I got to take on my French persona. French Me somehow had much better social skills than the real me, even if his English was a bit limited.\\n\\nBut then there was the day it all came crashing down. I was walking to my car and saw one of the neighbours coming towards me from the opposite direction with someone else next to her I didn’t recognise. She stopped to say hi, as she normally does, and then she says to her friend “this is f7tj78, the guy I was telling you about”. You might be able to see where this is going. \\n\\nHer friend hits me with a question in French that I didn’t understand a word of, and I knew he was actually French straight away because his accent was way better than mine. I didn’t know what to do and I just froze. Every second that went past just made it so much more painful and after way too long of a pause I just decided I had to come clean. I told her I wasn’t actually French and couldn’t speak French and then I tried to play it off like some kind of practical joke I’d been doing on everyone. Nobody was buying that. I fast walked straight to my car and then let the embarrassment just swallow me for a while.\\n\\nI haven’t spoken to any of my neighbours since, some of which I’d  struck up a friendly relationship with over those 10 months. I make sure nobody is around now whenever I leave the house, and I do a loop around the block in my car if any of my neighbours are walking down the street when I get home so that I never come into contact with them. Every time I think about the day I was discovered the embarrassment physically hurts me.\\n\\nTL;DR: Pretended to be French to avoid human interaction on LSD, lived a lie for 10 months and got exposed by a French man.\\n\\nEDIT: I didn’t think this post was going to catch much attention, and I’m praying none of my neighbours use reddit and see this and decide to come over to talk to me about all this. Some people seem to have a hard time believing that I thought keeping it going for 10 months would actually be a good idea, I’d like to remind people that when I made the decision to keep it up this was supposed to be a very temporary living situation for me. **Please, I beg you before you start commenting about why I was topless in my house, please read the edit I added** ***please***\\n\\nDear Reddit, today I fucked up *big time*\\n\\nToday I fucked up so bad that I had to make a new email so I could create a new Reddit account because I never want this to ever come back to me.\\n\\nFor context, my dad was hired to work an IT job at the school I attend around two years ago, for reference I am a 3rd-year college student, and while he was doing this job he became friends with some of the other IT people and through this he has been invited to go to a club where they listen to music and appreciate it. Some of my teachers are in this club, especially one my favorite teacher, horrifying I know.\\n\\nDue to the current Coronavirus pandemic, they have moved their meetings online through video calls, here is where the fuck up begins. To join these calls my dad uses the family computer in the living room, for reference, my room is adjacent to the living room and if my door is open I can directly see the computer from my doorway.\\n\\nLast night I was hanging out in my room wearing headphones and watching some Netflix while playing animal crossing, what else is there to do in the literal apocalypse? As I am playing I spill some salsa on my *white* shirt meaning if I want to salvage the shirt I have to soak it immediately so I get off my bed and take off my shirt and as this is quarantine I am not wearing a bra, why I took off my shirt before I left my room I don\\'t know. Here is where the fuck up begins.\\n\\nThe stars must have lined up for this to happen because\\n\\n1. I did not know my dad was attending this video conference\\n2. My dad had left the living room to go to the bathroom\\n3. And I am in clear view of the video camera on the family computer in the living room, and didn\\'t think about it ***at all***\\n\\nSo, I leave my room tiddies out and all and walk to the laundry room to get the stain out of my shirt, done easy no problem. As I walk back to my room I get a craving for some soda and decide to go get one, the kitchen is adjacent to the living room, right next to the family computer.\\n\\nI walk by the computer and into the kitchen, open the fridge and behind me I hear \"uhm, OP?\" and I immediately recognize my teacher\\'s voice.\\n\\n***I stop dead in my tracks***\\n\\nYou know that feeling when your stomach drops and your entire body just freezes **that**.\\n\\nIn my panic, I was so shocked and I was just putting 2 and 2 together and just go \"no\" and drop to the floor, and sit on the floor, my back against the kitchen island with my knees to my chest and I have no idea what to, there is no way I can get back into my room without going past the camera.\\n\\nLuckily my dad came to the rescue and came back to the room shortly after and this was the conversation that followed\\n\\nFT - Favorite Teacher\\n\\nDad - My dad\\n\\nMe - Me\\n\\nFT - \"Hey I believe your daughter might be in hiding, you might want to hang up so she can safely return to her room\"\\n\\nDad - \"OP you there?\" (he cant see me because of how I am sitting\"\\n\\nMe - \"...yes\"\\n\\nDad - \"do I want to know?\"\\n\\nMe - \"No\"\\n\\nDad - \"should I disconnect from the call?\"\\n\\nMe - \"yes... can you also close your eyes until I tell you to open them?\"\\n\\nDad, very confused at this point - \"ok?\"\\n\\nMy dad proceeds to turn off his camera and tells me I can leave\\n\\nI then fled the scene, locked my door and ***immediately*** put on a shirt, I called out for my dad that it was safe and a few minutes later I could hear him laugh with everyone in the call\\n\\nWe have yet to discuss this\\n\\nIf you made it this far I applaud you, however, for personal reasons, I will now be passing away thank you.\\n\\nTL;DR - I accidentally made porn for my teacher\\n\\nEDIT: for those asking why I was not wearing a bra when at home with my family,\\n\\n1. I\\'ve been at college for so long and just got home after my school shut its a habit\\n2. my favorite shirt had a stain, I wasn\\'t thinking I just wanted to get the stain out as quick as possible to save my shirt\\n3. We all just usually keep to our rooms none of us really use the living room unless we are all together, especially not around 11 pm on a Friday evening, I\\'m an only child and my parents usually go to bed around 8\\n\\nEdit 2: Thank you for awards kind internet strangers!\\n\\nAlso to everyone asking if my teacher is hot, he is fairly good looking, however married and gay... I am also a lesbian so I doubt anything will ever happen Not today, this was several years ago now but I still cringe about it every now and then.\\n\\nWhen I was a freshman at university I had a huuuge crush on one of my lecturers. Who was honestly just a regular looking middle aged man. I was so obsessed with him that I often stalked him online including on LinkedIn, where I made a profile just so that I could stalk him. I’m talking really often. It was creepy. \\n\\nYears later when I joined the workforce and actually started using LinkedIn seriously I realised that people actually get notified every time someone views your profile.\\n\\nHe used to give me odd looks when I would pass him around campus and I used to be paranoid thinking oh god he knows that I fantasise about him bending me over his desk in his office. But then I’d think nah nah nah how could he possibly know that? \\n\\nHe must’ve been thinking hey there’s that weird girl who used to look at my LinkedIn profile daily. \\n\\nHe even saw me at my graduation and made a very deliberate glance at me. He. Knows  \\n\\nTLDR: stalked my professor on LinkedIn without knowing he’d be notified that I viewed his profile Okay so necessary this actually happened in the last couple of weeks. Basically my boyfriend suffers from pretty low self esteem, like it\\'s not like he\\'s too bothered about his looks but he rates himself a 5 out of 10 at best. \\n\\nObviously I think he\\'s gorgeous and handsome but even though I\\'ve been saying this for years, he does not believe me. So, for some stupid reason, I decided to show him that other girls would find him attractive by making him a tinder account. I set him up an account, make him a bio and just start swiping right. \\n\\nAfter a day he got around a dozen matches on tinder and after I showed this to him, I saw how he immediately became more confident and thanked me for the whole gesture. \\n\\nQueue my surprise when a couple of days later I check the tinder account I had basically forgotten after 24 hours, and I could see lots of messages sent to lots of the girls my bf had matched with. \\n\\nI confronted him and he denied it but I mean these messages even included promises to meet each other. Obviously, we broke up and out of curiosity I checked the tinder account again after a week and this breakup has clearly not slowed him down one bit. So now the tinder I made for him not only broke us up, but is now helping him navigate his newly single life loooooooool\\n\\nTL;DR: made a tinder account for my bf to prove that he is attractive and he ended up ditching me for one of the girls he matched with\\n\\nEdit: Wow I did not expect this to blow up! Thank you so much for the gold and silver and for your kind, kind words. It honestly touches me how absolutely lovely thousands of strangers can be. \\n\\nAlso, if anyone needs help with their tinder, hmu lol because I’m apparently pretty good at it. \\n\\n Disclaimer- this happened at least 6 years ago and was deeply repressed by shame. I only remembered it in a conversation with my wife when she asked, “What was your most embarrassing moment?”\\n\\nSo I was at a work party, and my gf at the time (not currently my wife) offered to pick me up and drive me home, knowing I would get fully sloshed at the party. She was right.\\n\\nOn the way home, I ask her to pull into a gas station for cigarettes. She pulls her light blue Jeep into the parking lot, I stumble out of the Jeep, go in, and complete my purchase. \\n\\nI (over aggressively) yank open the passengers door to the blue Jeep, plop myself down on the seat, and say to my gf. “I can’t wait to get home and fuck the shit out of you.”\\n\\nI was not expecting to get hit in the face. I also did not expect the loudest goddamn screaming I’ve ever heard in my life. Instinctively, I covered up my face and wondered what the hell I said wrong, as it was not uncommon for either of us to say something like that to each other. \\n\\nThe screaming was intense and sounded very scared, so I couldn’t really make out what my gf was yelling, until between punch 3 or 4, when I heard, clear as a bell, “You fucking rapist get the fuck outta my car.”\\n\\nWHOA WHOA WHOA instant sobriety. I uncovered my face and looked up, finally dawning on me that although I was in a blue Jeep, it was not my gfs blue Jeep. My gfs identical blue Jeep was parked next to- and blocked by- this random woman’s blue Jeep. \\n\\nI finally tumbled out of the car, went to my gfs car, and told her what happened. She convinced the woman not to call the police to tell them about some crazy guy breaking into her car and telling her he was gonna fuck her. \\n\\nI did not fuck anyone that night. \\n\\nTL;DR: drunkenly got into the wrong car, assumed the driver was my gf, and told her I was going to fuck her So I have an uncle (we will call him J) who has always been VERY vocal about his disapproval of my sexuality. There is not a family gathering that goes by where he doesn\\'t say something assholish about homosexuality or me specifically.\\n\\nWell this weekend in between family gatherings I was looking to meet somebody . I started chatting with an older man because that\\'s how I roll. A lot of older guys don\\'t like to show their faces because they aren\\'t out so I don\\'t think much of it when he doesn\\'t show me his face. We actually hit it off great and after receiving a few pics I wish I could unsee and sending a few I wish I could take back , we decided to meet up for well... you know.\\n\\nSo I\\'m at this coffee shop down the street waiting for my man to show up and you know who walks in . It is at this moment I realize my FU, I\\'ve been flirting with my gay hating closeted uncle.  He tried to play it off like a random encounter but I wasn\\'t letting him get away with that. After some pressing he finally admits that he is the man I\\'ve been talking to and I told him I don\\'t judge him like he does me . He apologized for the hurtful things he\\'s said to me over the years \\n\\nHe kept talking with me like he was still INTERESTED and I had to make it clear that was NOT going to happen . I had to get up and walk out and after multiple texts from him I had to go ahead and block his number. I can\\'t believe this guy had the nerve to judge me and treat me like less of a human being all these years when he\\'s a total creep and a massive hypocrite.\\n\\nAlways get a face pic, people.\\n\\nTL:DR: chatted and eventually met up with a potential hookup that turned out to be my homophobic uncle . Should have insisted on the face pic\\n\\nEdit: yea this blew up... too much to respond to but I\\'ll answer some pressing questions . I did, in fact, send a face pic so he did know who I was . It is pretty disturbing to say the least. As far as blackmail goes I have everything saved but I don\\'t plan on doing anything with it as I think that could actually put me in danger . This man obviously has more problems that any of us could have known.\\n\\nEdit 2: this was fake . Reddit is gullible and I fucking hate TIFU . It\\'s all fake stories just like twoxchromosomes . Get baited . AMA https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/bgvj1e/i_made_the_front_page_with_50k_upvotes_yesterday/ This TIFU actually happened yesterday (throwaway account)\\n\\nIt was a sunny day in an otherwise crappy Scandinavian summer. So me and my 5yo son went out to play at one of the city playgrounds. This particular playground has a really cool artificial river for kids to play in. Needless to say, the place was packed. Since my boy was having such a good time playing with his friends, now was a good moment to make my weekly FaceTime-call with my mom.\\n\\nHence my error....\\n\\nFast forward 5 minutes.... I am still having a nice chat, laying down with the sun in my face. Life is good. When suddenly the sun literally got blocked by four or five moms and dads gathering around me, looking absolutely PISSED. One of the dads says: \"we called the police\". I had no clue what they were talking about. Let alone that they meant that they called the police on *me*. I naively asked \"oh, what happened?\". Replied by \"You are filming our kids without our permission.\".... eh, wait, what??\\n\\nWhile still on FaceTime with my mom I look over my phone to see what I am actually pointing my camera towards. I see a bunch of butt-naked kids running around, while my own kid wandered off to some other part of the playground. I desperately tried to explain what is going on, and that I wasn\\'t just filming random kids. But I was so stressed that I couldn\\'t find the words (I am living in this country as a foreigner, and don\\'t fully master the language yet). Honestly, if I were these guys I would be darn sceptical of the situation myself.\\n\\nBy now the crowd grew to a mob of 15 people or so. I got up to get my kid, when one of the dads says that I cannot leave without leaving my phone. \"Hell no\", I said. That sobered me up quite fast and I explained in clearer words what is going on. The situation cooled down and most parents walked away. But there were two couples that would have none of it, and demanded me to stay until the police arrived.\\n\\nEventually the police showed up and fortunately they were really chill about it - almost laughing when I explained what was going on. They asked me to show my camera-roll which of course showed nothing improper. Also I showed my call history, which indicated that indeed I had quite a long phone call with my mom on FaceTime.\\n\\nThe angry couples apologised, which I appreciated. Me and my son gathered our stuff and immediately went home. On the way home my son asked why everyone wanted to see my pictures..... Oh boy, I can\\'t wait for him to be old enough for me to tell him this story.\\n\\nTL;DR : Went to the water-playground with my kid, called my mom on FaceTime, and was mistaken by  parents for voyeur-filming their naked kids.\\n\\nEDIT 1: Whow this exploded! Interesting to see the different perspectives. I guess there are some cultural differences between the nations - which is fine. I don\\'t judge culture.\\n\\nEDIT 2: Regarding social distancing; Scandinavia is not in lock-down, and (practically) never has been. We have a relatively obedient population where we follow government recommendations without too much questioning. So far we were spared the catastrophe, meaning that our kids can still play in the park. But who knows that the future holds in store... Stay safe everyone! The tale I\\'m about to weave happened some time ago. Figured I\\'d tell this story though so here it goes:\\n\\nI used to date this girl and early on in our relationship we were all about the \"going out to bars\" phase and hanging out every chance we could. Well it was a Friday night and my brother was playing guitar at a bar so I thought it\\'d be fun to join my parents and my sister and drink and listen to him play. My parents arrived at the bar first, and then my girlfriend and I arrived in my car. We parked a couple cars down from my dads car. There were a ton of cars so we found a spot and nestled right in. \\n\\nCut to an hour in: We\\'re having a grand old time, drinkin and yuckin\\' it up with my family. Well I look at my girlfriend and she flashes me the, \"sexy eyes\" and of course me being a drunk and horny 23 year old decides to flash em back. So i pretend I\\'m going outside with her to have a smoke and we go to my car and it\\'s pretty dark out. Noone is around. I triple check to look for people and then when I assume its safe i pull out my log and she starts giving me the ol blowie. \\n\\nNow I\\'m in the car for a good 15 minutes with her and we were both drunk, but not completely useless...but we both must of lost track of time because we were so in the moment that we didn\\'t realize the \"gig\" my brother was playing let out....\\n\\nI hear the knock on the window first and we both jump about 2 feet in the air in our seats. I look up. My sister starts walking away shaking her head. I see my mom with the most horrified look on her face. My brother is loading up my dads car with his music equipment. My dad just turned and tried to hurry my mom back to their car. Meanwhile my girlfriend pretends to be looking for a contact while I\\'m struggling to zip up my jeans. \\n\\nThe next day my girlfriend and I had plans for dinner with my parents. I wanted to get ahead of the situation to gauge my dad\\'s reaction and to hopefully find out what exactly they saw. So I begin to open my mouth when he cuts me off and says \"so we\\'re having chicken for dinner tonight\". \"Cool dad, but <insert gfs name here> is a vegetarian\". And without missing a beat my dad says: \"not from what we saw last night....unless you have a broccoli dick.\" Ladies and gentlemen, my father.\\n\\nTl:dr - my entire family caught me getting a blowjob from my girlfriend at the time.  So last Thursday night I saw everyone tagging their step dads in the Budweiser commercial. Without watching it, I sent it to my stepdad. About an hour later my step dad and mom call me and ask if I’m hinting at something. My step dad is like I know you had intent. I’m like HUH??? OMG IN THE COMMERCIAL THE ADULT CHILDREN ARE ASKING THEIR STEPDADS TO ADOPT THEM. So he starts crying, thinking I want this. Now I can’t tell him that I didn’t mean to. Friday he squeezed me so tight and said he wants me take his name and make it official. Etc etc. all I can think is wow that sounds like a huge hassle. But I can never say anything about it being an accident. So like now I’m being adopted and changing my name. \\n\\nTl/dr sent a fathers day commercial to my stepdad who is adopting me now. I’m 31! Around two years ago, I invested in a new pc that came with a GTX 1050. I didn\\'t really notice any difference in performance when I used a laptop and was struggling to understand why anyone would even want to use a pc if there wasn\\'t that much of a benefit.\\n\\nI continued using it up until a few days ago, where I finally caved in and ordered a new GTX 1660 S graphics card. Obviously, I expected this new one to be much much better than my previous one. Boy, I was wrong. I felt absolutely no difference whatsoever. \\n\\nIt was only until then when I realised the HDMI cable had been connected into the crappy Intel graphics card that comes with every Intel CPU. \\n\\ntl;dr I didn\\'t realise my pc was connected to the crappy built in graphics card instead of the one that I bought\\n\\nedit: For those asking if the 1050 is on sale, I\\'ll be giving it to my brother. This morning I decided to surprise my girlfriend with a proposal in bed. Not the most original or romantic approach, I know. Initially the plan was to pop the question over dinner last night, but alas, the build up towards the big moment got the better of me. However, today I woke up determined to do what needed to be done. \\n\\nSo, there I was, on one knee next to my girlfriend\\'s side of the bed, waiting for her to open her eyes and see me holding the ring. The moment I attempted to wake her up she groaned and rolled over, leaving me with nothing to look at but the back of her head. My heart was beating hard enough to hear. I leaned over my girlfriend and gently tapped her on the shoulder. Instead of waking up like a normal person, she *hissed* in her sleep like a fucking vampire before elbowing me in the face. I stumbled back and dropped the damn ring.\\n\\nMy girlfriend woke up during the commotion and the first thing she saw was me bleeding from my nose. Not gonna lie, when she rushed over to comfort me I flinched. The hissing thing she did scared the shit out of me. After all the drama died down, I managed to recover the ring without her noticing. Speaking of recover, my nose still hurts. \\n\\nTonight I\\'ll try again. This time I\\'ll make sure to propose while my girlfriend is wide awake and still human.\\n\\n\\n**TL:DR Attempted to surprise my girlfriend with a proposal in bed, but little did I know getting her to wake up required blood.**\\n\\n*Edit: I\\'m just gonna leave an update here for all the comments requesting an update. She said yes! My girlfriend is now officially my fianceé. Not that anyone really cares about this part, but my nose also stopped hurting.* Right off the bat I want to say that I am in no way shape or form making light of suicide. This was not a prank gone wrong, or something I did on purpose, but rather a very unfortunate series of usually perfectly benign activities that led to me accidentally terrifying and mortifying my wife. Burner for reasons.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis happened a couple of weeks ago. I tripped and sprained my ankle. It\\'s been bothering me enough that I\\'ve been taking Epsom salt baths in the evenings after work. In addition to helping with the sprain and swelling, I also find it incredibly relaxing. Say what you want about a grown man taking a bath, I enjoy a good soak.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI also deal with a condition called angiokeratoma. It\\'s basically blood vessels that have expanded and cause a few small, (albeit slightly unsightly) dark spots a rather sensitive area...I call them old man spots. They\\'re harmless, and most of the time I don\\'t even notice, BUT every once in a while...I\\'ll irritate one of these small bumps and it bleeds like a sonofabitch. Additionally it takes FOREVERRR to get the bleeding to stop...its not like I can elevate my balls, Let alone put a band aid on...\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWell...on the day in question, I get a text from my wife that she\\'s going to be working late. So, I get home and decide to soak my ankle/enjoy a little peace and quiet. It\\'s not really important how I did it, but I ended up nicking one of those spots. So, after cursing a reasonable amount, I start the lengthy ritual of holding TP against it and checking every so often to see if it\\'s stopped. Even after the bleeding stops I have to be very careful for the next few minutes to not get it started again, almost like scratching off a very fresh scab...Well I finally get it stopped and a short time later, proceed with my bath. I put on my headphones, closed my eyes and relaxed...\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n I wasn\\'t asleep but I was really zoned out and relaxed...until I was snapped out of it by my wife screaming in absolute terror. I\\'ve never ever ever heard her, or anyone scream like that. It scared the shit out of me, and I jolted awake nearly flew out of the tub. I shouted \"HONEY? WHAT THE FUCK!\"  She didn\\'t answer me, she was in a heap on the floor bawling.  It took me a second to figure out what the hell was going on before shouting \"Jesus Christ!\".....I could see what it must look like to her... I had apparently NOT stopped the bleeding as well as I thought I had....and my wife walked in on me eyes closed, slouched over in bathtub full of very bloody water.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt took me a long time to calm her down, and I don\\'t think that\\'s something you just get over. Hopefully one day we can laugh about it, but it won\\'t be any time soon.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR - nicked my nuts, didn\\'t stop the bleeding completely even though I thought I had. Took a bath, zoned out. Wife walked in on me oblivious to the fact I was bleeding into the water and thought that I had killed myself. Sorry honey.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B; Bit of back story. I started talking to a guy on Reddit last week. We hit it off, started texting and found out that he lives about 20 minutes from me. We decided to meet for a date on Friday. I have IBS and stomach was feeling a bit dodgy, but decided to soldier on. I was also very tired.\\n\\nThe FU: So I\\'m at this guy\\'s house and I\\'ve made us a very nice Mac n Cheese. There was some cuddling, kissing and some sex. We\\'re then snuggling on the sofa and I feel a big fart brewing. I\\'m hoping I can just absorb it back in to my body if I hold on to it long enough. \\n\\nWe start talking about massages and the guy offers to give me one. I choose a \\'relaxing\\' oil. I\\'m naked on my front and he is naked, straddling me, kind of sitting on my bum. He starts rubbing my back, and turns out he\\'s good at massages. I\\'m feeling really relaxed and start to drift off.\\n\\nI then wake myself up with the most earth shattering fart I have ever expelled. The fart I was holding captive had burst free with a vengeance, displeased by the extended time spent in my rectum. It was hella loud and it was hella long. And it was right on his balls. It was so forceful, they vibrated.\\n\\nHis response was to tell me, through tears of laughter \\'At least you didn\\'t shit yourself\\'.\\n\\nTLDR: Farted on a first date\\'s balls.\\n\\nEdit: For anybody interested, the mac n cheese is a very tasty recipe for those on a fodmap diet. You can replace pretty much all elements for low fodmap alternatives - gluten free pasta, lactofree milk and cheese, asafoetida for onion and garlic oil for garlic! \\nSo quite recently I’ve been listening to the song “Scatman”, which for the uninitiated is a dope song of a dude scatting which kinda goes like “scatdobiddlybiddlygiddlydiddlybiddlydiddly...”  and then he says “I’m the Scatman!”.\\n\\nSo I couldn’t get this song out of my head for the past couple days and I was always queuing it up on Spotify. \\n\\nLong story short a girl I’ve been dating came over last night and my brain didn’t override my stupidity when I decided to add Scatman to my sexytime playlist. \\n\\nWhen she came over it was pretty much ‘prepare for battlestations’ from the first minute, so I put the sexytime playlist on shuffle. It started off well with some song from the Mezzanine album, and then one I can’t remember and then a jazzy one. By this point I was just beginning to go down on her. \\n\\nThis is where I fucked up. The Scatman song came up next after the relaxing jazz and it was so fucking jarring. \\n\\nI guess a normal person would’ve stopped and skipped the song. I really regret not doing that now. \\n\\nInstead of that, without skipping a fucking beat, I started to use my tongue and went down on her at the same exact pace as the dude in the song was scatting. It was so fast that I had to concentrate hard to get the timing right. I know it probably was bad technique, but I started and I had to commit.  \\nIt was probably 9 seconds of doing that before I stopped and came up. I looked into her eyes and perfectly in time with the song I said “I’m the Scatman”.  \\n\\nI don’t know what expression I expected to see on her, my brain clearly short circuited for me to do that in the first place. What I didn’t expect was the look of pure disgust.  \\n\\nThat moment went in pure slow motion for me. My brain pretty much exploded and was like “ah fuck I can’t believe I’ve done this” \\n\\nI saw no means of recovery so I got up and paused the song. And she said “can we just hang for a bit instead”  and I agreed. We ended up watching an episode of Friends, both of us refusing to acknowledge what just happened. Then she said she had to go back to her place.\\n\\nWe’ve only been dating for 3 weeks and I’m pretty sure I might’ve totally fucked this up. At least I have a funny story out of it, though I’d much prefer having a girlfriend.\\n\\nTldr: Went down on a girl to the Scatman song and now she might turn into a ghost\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUPDATE: Since people have been asking. Nothings really has happened after I texted her “how’s it goin” the next day. Sorry to not have a juicy follow up story. Hopefully we don’t get into the same classes next semester at uni.\\n\\nIf we somehow get back together, I’ll make sure not to remove Scatman from my playlist.\\n\\nI’m somewhat disturbed by the comments that theorised that she thought I was sexually attracted to fecal matter. I’ll try not to believe it, but looking back on her reaction it does make a lot of sense. Edit: I am blown away by all the awards, and moreso by all the kind words and compliments about my writing. You guys have motivated me to start writing more. Thank you!\\n\\nDidn\\'t happen today, but still a bizarre and embarrassing memory that sometimes wakes me up at night.\\n\\nImportant preface: I am \"drive the 1998 honda civic from the trailer park to Walmart to buy a $5 wolf t-shirt\" poor. \\n\\nA few years ago, I worked about 25 hours a week humping the grill at McDonald\\'s in a frighteningly small town. When I wasn\\'t on the clock, I was free to drink and mingle with the bottom of the social ladder of rural America. They were actually some of the nicest people I\\'ve ever met.\\n\\nThis was a self destructive period in my life. For entertainment, I\\'d pass the day drinking and crawling through Facebook for entertainment/drama. There isn\\'t much more to do when you live in the trailer park in the middle of a cornfield in the Midwest. Especially when your weed guy is out of town.\\n\\nI ended up friend requesting a somewhat older girl who was, well, \"trashy hot.\" Like a trailer park Emma Watson with stress lines on her face. She seemed... open.\\n\\nWe exchanged pleasantries, which rapidly escalated to us flirting because we were both horny. We flirted for about 2 hours, which escalated to sexting. Through the haze of alcohol and horniness, I was certain that this was the most beautiful woman this side of the trailer park and I had scored big. We scrambled to make a time to meet up and \"chill.\" Trailer Emma says \"I\\'m ready for you now 😏😏\". Now THAT got my warrior to stand at attention.\\n\\nThere was one problem though: she lived 40 miles away, across the county line, and snow was in the forecast. My poor little beater car did not handle snow well. But my dick had been crying out for this woman for hours now. \\n\\nSo I said fuck it. Took a minute to freshen up in my dirty little bathroom and hopped in the car. Quarter of a tank. That should be enough.\\n\\nWhat followed was a long, windy drive through the dark, on ugly back roads. My dick ached from being hard for so long. Visions of passionately porking this woman flashed through my mind.\\n\\nIt took a while to find her house-- er, trailer. It was in a small trailer park basically in the middle of nowhere, way in the back. I had to crawl through the rows of dirty single wides, headlights on high, feeling intrusive and out of place. It seemed that the farther I creeped, the more run down the trailers became. By the time I got to the back, I was passing piles of siding and glass.\\n\\nI finally get to her trailer. It\\'s... Not great. But my dickbrain is fixated on the night of passion that surely lays before me.\\n\\nTrailer Emma answers the door. She... Used a much nicer picture on Facebook. Even enrapt in a state of almost spiritual horniness, I could tell she had, well, aged. When she smiled, I noticed several of her teeth were black. My stomach clenched a little. I do NOT do well with bad teeth. \\n\\nBut the show must go on.\\n\\nShe took me in and briefly pointed out her kids. There were three small, dirty looking children huddled around an old TV. I remember her mentioning being a mom, but 3 kids was a little much... Plus they didn\\'t look cared for. Uh oh.\\n\\nBy this point, a small part of me had already decided that an entire night of love making was off the menu, that I would bail when the fireworks were over. But not before some action. I still thought this girl was hot as long as she kept her mouth closed.\\n\\nShe pulled me into her bedroom-- which had an entire litter of kittens staring at me in the corner-- and started making out with me. Her kisses were way too sloppy and wet. This whole experience was going downhill pretty fast.\\n\\nMy spirit was torn in two-- part of me wanted to bail. The dirtiness, her physical appearance, the creepy trailerpark, the goddamn kittens watching me-- but the other part of me wanted to rip this woman\\'s clothes off and fuck her till her pussy retired and moved to an assisted living facility.\\n\\nMy little head won.\\n\\nI pushed her against the wall and started kissing her neck. I did my best to avoid her nasty mouth, though she kept trying to push it into my face. Within moments she was naked on the bed, legs spread, waiting for my stiff magic wand. This is what I had wanted, what I had been waiting for, a night of passionate love making with a questionable but moderately attractive Facebook mom, so I thrust my loins forth... and came immediately with a shudder and a groan.\\n\\n\"You came *now?* Trailer Emma said in a disappointed voice that still haunts my dreams. I guess being aroused for four hours can often result in sperm school being let out early.\\n\\nNow, I\\'m just a man. This has happened before. Normally I\\'d take a few minutes to recharge my batteries and get back to work.\\n\\nWhich is what I would have done... Had I not been experiencing the singularly WORST episode of post nut clarity/regret that I ever had in my entire life. Everything hit me at once. Being far from home, at night, in a strange trailerpark. Her dirty, sad looking kids in the other room.  Her meth mouth. Her emaciated frame clinging to a pair of obviously fake boobs. \\n\\nIt was like the existential dread/paranoia from weed, except it came out of my dick.\\n\\nThen, I noticed the window. Remember how I said snow was in the forecast? Well, there it was! Fluttering past the outside light like a ghostly interpretive dance of \"your ass ain\\'t going home.\"\\n\\nI immediately hopped up and tried to emit some kind of plausible excuse for leaving. I don\\'t even remember what I said. I do remember her sitting on the bed and giving me a blank stare as I fumbled over words. I felt like the dumbest man in the world. I just wanted to disappear.\\n\\nI quickly threw my clothes on and stumbled out the door without a good-bye. I start my beater car and try to reverse. But I don\\'t move. My bald tires spin in the mix of slush and mud. I start to panic. I gently depress the accelerator as visions of spending the night with this weird lady and her kids dance in my head. By a miracle of God, the car lurches backwards. I laugh hysterically with relief.\\n\\nThe drive home was long, slow, and dangerous. The snow hurtled past my windshield in silence, my chest heavy with embarrassment and regret. What in the blue fuck was I thinking?? Driving 40 miles in the snow to fuck a stranger in a strange place?? I couldn\\'t wait to get home and forget these awful memories in a haze of pot and PBR.\\n\\nThe first thing I did when I got home was log into Facebook to block my lover. Thankfully, she already had. Then I went to my room and got so, so drunk.\\n\\nEverything was better till I woke with a fever... Because I had chlamydia... Because I went in on a strange woman bareback. I had to call my gram to pick me up in her nicer vehicle and take me to the clinic an hour away. She grilled me the whole time about why I was going and I had to lie and say I had a sore throat.\\n\\nThe antibiotics they gave me ended up making me incredibly sick so I had to go to the clinic a few days later for a big shot. I missed four days of work and almost didn\\'t make rent.\\n\\nSo, I traded about three seconds of sexual enjoyment for an infected dick, a tiny paycheck, a pissed off gram, and a lifetime of embarrassing memories.\\n\\nI *did* talk to a social worker at the clinic about Trailer Emma and my concerns about her kids. Not sure what happened after that, but she said she\\'d look into it...\\n\\nMy life is a little less self destructive these days. I moved to a better town, got a better job, and settled down with a girl. But I will never forget my misadventure with that woman. The memory of revving the engine and not moving is particularly haunting. I may have actually been traumatized a little...\\n\\nTLDR Drove 40 miles on shitty roads to bang a strange woman, got bad lost but regret and almost got stuck in the driveway, caught an STD and had to miss a lot of work, then I almost missed rent.\\n\\nAll because I couldn\\'t just rub one out.\\n\\nEdit 2: important clarifications-- yes, not using a condom was incredibly dumb, both for me and for my partner. No, she did not get pregnant with my child. It\\'s pretty easy to check up on people in low population areas. Trailer Emma is fine.  Obligatory this didn\\'t happen today, but a couple of weeks ago.\\n\\n So I sometimes drive for ride share companies to make extra cash and keep me off of the couch. I live in a touristy area that booms during summer months and vacation rental homes are common... So common that I sometimes do pick-ups and drop-offs at the same homes for different people week to week and family/friend groups of people renting the homes are the norm.\\n\\n One particular day I dropped a guy off at a beautiful home near the beach, that I had picked a guy up from just an hour or two prior. So as we arrive I mention this to the rider:\\n\\nMe - Hey I just picked one of your buddys up from here about an hour ago\\n\\nRider- No, must be the wrong house\\n\\nMe- Nope, he walked right out of that side door. I dropped him off at *names local bar* His girlfriend is still in there though, she stayed behind. (I had seen her kiss him goodbye at the door, but didn\\'t mention this to the rider) You guys having a family/friend vacation?\\n\\nRider- This is a family owned home, it\\'s been in my family for years and we don\\'t rent it out. Nobody lives here but me and my wife and I\\'ve been in NY for work for the past 4 days. \\n\\nAwkward silence as we both come to the realization. \\n\\nHe got out and I drove away scolding myself for having such a big mouth. \\n\\nTLDR- I may have ruined a marriage by trying to make small talk with my big mouth\\n\\n* Edit- Thanks for all of the support guys! I know I did nothing wrong, I just hate being involved in other people\\'s businesses, especially when it\\'s so negative. \\n\\n Also - Thanks for the silver and platinum awards! About four months ago, I started doing daily Kegel routines to improve and intensify my orgasms.\\n\\nThey work.\\n\\nToday, doing sit-ups on a bench at the gym, I began to feel strange. As I pushed upward on each rep, my body felt and tenser and tenser, like...frustrated and elated, and I was vividly aware of the inseam of my shorts between my legs.\\n\\nRight before the...peak, I finally realized what was happening. Stifling a moan, I threw myself forward, trying to avoid lying arched and spread-eagled on my back. I ended up crashing to the floor, clutching myself.\\n\\nOnce I could think again, I realized people were running toward me and yelling about seizures and heart attacks and 911.\\n\\nI curled into the fetal position. I was raised to be deeply, deeply ashamed of every aspect of my sexuality, and though I\\'ve recovered enough now to be adventurous IN the bedroom, I\\'m still a ball of shame in public.\\n\\nHearing sirens (my gym is four blocks from the fire station), I wished for death. Finally, when the paramedics were about to grab me, knowing a I couldn\\'t afford the monetary devastation of an ER visit, I sat up and yelled, \"IT WAS AN ORGASM I\\'M FINE.\"\\n\\nI\\'m never going to that gym again.\\n\\nBut I am gonna see where these Kegels take me.\\n\\nTL;DR - Did too many Kegels, had a mega-orgasm at the gym, concerned people thought I was dying.\\n\\n**Edit:** Holy hot hell. The messages telling me I\\'m a (A), \"greasy neckbeard who\\'s never seen a woman,\" or (B), \"a fucking lying slut who needs to fucking die for spreading fucking cancerous shit\" are pouring in. \\n\\nTaking my secrets to the grave next time I fuck up.  Dear lord. On my main account i came across a comment on a post in an ask men sub, it seemed vaguely familiar, so I clicked the user name and looked through the profile.  I click on profiles all the time if a comment seems familiar, or interesting...\\n\\nThis is my sons account. It has to be. The comment he posted is about something that happened while I was there. He had a more detailed post about that specific day. He had another previous post about an event in his life I knew about and knew some details about. He had a few other posts which I also read. \\n\\nI now know what gets him going sexually. Not something I needed to know.\\n\\nI know what his girlfriend likes sexually. Also, not something I needed to know. Also quite surprising. \\n\\nI know how embarrassed he felt about an emotional time he had somewhat recently with my wife. I feel kind of heart broken for him about that one.\\n\\nI know that when he was younger he snooped in mine and my wife’s room.\\n\\nIn reading through the comments he’s made to others, I’ve learned that he is wise beyond his years and an incredibly kind human. I feel very proud about that.\\n\\nOverall, I wish I never clicked that first comment. I know waaaay more about his sex life than a father should.\\n\\nTL;DR. Accidentally discovered my son on reddit. Found out about his kinky sex life, some heart break, and that the little fucker has snooped through my room.\\n\\n**edited to add: yes, I shouldn’t have read all of it. And some posts I stayed away from. And honestly, I didn’t realize it right-right away. The first post I read sounded like him, but there are millions of redditors. It was after another that I really put the pieces together. And yeah, their might be some hypocrisy about being slightly mad about him snooping through my room. But hey, life isn’t always fair. I also have no intention of tell him, or anyone else anything I read.** This happened two weeks ago, but I found out today. Throwaway as they use Reddit.\\n\\nMy best friend (m) is married to a photographer, she is actually quite well respected locally and has bad exhibitions... just not quite like this. \\n\\nThey have a young son who I went round to babysit for while they had a well earned break. My best friend being the loving but incompetent idiot he is, bought her an expensive Polaroid camera which is markedly worse than anything his wife owns. They\\'ve given it to their son who has shown no interest whatsoever. \\n\\nSo I\\'m pissing around with him, watching cartoons and spot the camera among his things. My friend and I have a childish sense of humour so I take the camera and take a Polaroid of my junk. It turns out horribly blurry, dark and you cant work out what it is. I leave it on my mates desk on his keyboard and forget about it, hoping when he sees it he will get a laugh when he works out what it is. \\n\\nBabysitting goes fine, I leave. \\n\\nI went round to visit today and immediately saw the polaroid, framed, on their kitchen wall. I absolutely crack up and ask why it\\'s there. His wife replies that \"It\\'s *childs* first photo, he took it and left it on Daddy\\'s desk for him\". She was so proud that her son had used the camera, taken a photo and gave it to his dad that she framed and hung it. \\n\\nI haven\\'t got the courage to break it to them that it\\'s not their childs first photo taken, it\\'s my dick.. and they framed it. \\n\\nTL;DR: Took a photo of my junk on a childs Polaroid camera and left it around as a joke for my best friend. They mistakenly believe their child likes photography and framed by dick. This actually happened two years ago on this day, which will make sense a little further down the road. In 2016 I started using Tinder for the first time after a shitty breakup. I had met a few people but nothing had ever really panned out beyond a few hookups. My profile was filled with some horseshit along the lines of “not the love of your life. perfect date for when you want your family to question your life choices” and was mostly filled with pictures of me hanging out with my dog. \\n\\nFast forward to March of 2017 and I matched with someone. After a couple of one-off messages that don’t really go anywhere, we ended up talking one night and stayed up til 5am messaging each other back and forth. A couple nights after that, we decided to meet up and she invites me over to her house for dinner. This all sounds great. Except for two problems.\\n\\nThe first problem is that I have a beard in all of my photos. And even calling it a beard is a bit of a stretch. My facial hair is like if someone shaved a Guinea pig and then superglued it to my face. If I grow it out too long, it looks like a tuft of pubes growing out from a chin. Wiry and sparse. It’s not good. For six years, I’d still kept a reasonably trimmed beard length because it was better than nothing and actually looks full when it\\'s shorter. But for some reason, the week before we started talking, I had decided to shave my face for the first time in years. I just wanted to know what it looked like. The answer? Not. Fucking. Good. At this point, I was 27 but still looked young for my age. Shave the beard off and I look like a twelve year old with a bunch of tattoos and insomnia. Really fucking awkward.\\n\\nSo I pulled up to her house and text before I got out of my car to say, “hey by the way, if it looks like a fifteen year old is knocking on your door, it’s just me.” Luckily, she\\'s not as turned off by my baby face as I expected. All good so far.\\n\\nI went inside and we end up hanging out all night. She cooked a badass dinner and we decided to watch a movie. She was blown away by the fact that I’d never seen Labyrinth and demanded we watch it. We ended up watching three movies that night. For Labyrinth, I was about five feet away on the couch. For Young Frankenstein, we were sitting next to each other. For the third movie (which I can’t remember for the life of me) we were cuddling. And this is where the second problem comes in. \\n\\nAfter my breakup in 2016 and realizing I’d been battling lifelong depression, I started taking antidepressants. One of the SUPER FUN side effects of SSRIs is that it can be really hard to climax. Like, try as you might, nothin. Dust. Moths. Nothin. Thanks, Big Pharma.\\n\\nAnd so commenced the next two hours of the worst sex either of us had ever had. Two hours of awkwardly grinding and sweating, stopping to try new positions, and statements like “holy fuck I might have a heart attack. Why are my ears ringing so loudly?\" and “What about this position?” “OUCH!” “Oh my god, I need a towel. So. Much. Sweat. I can\\'t see.” We were in the basement on a large three piece couch. You know, one of those ones with seams to connect the pieces. Well at one point I tried to plant my toes in the seam to get some traction and ended up kicking the couch piece away from us and sending us both flying to the floor. A bruised ass. A bent dick. A lot of questioning of whether this was a good idea. \\n\\nIf this had been a movie or a romance novel, a two hour sex binge sounds like a dream come true. Well let me tell you that shit sucks if you haven’t done any cardio in your fucking life. And jesus christ the sweat. So fucking slippery and gross. This wasn\\'t \\'golden light streaming through the windows and we\\'re both glistening\\' sweat. This is bog monsters come to life sweat. This is Ace Ventura crawling out of the rhino sweat. At one point our chests become suction cupped together. I could have run and slid on my belly down a hallway like a naked nightmare slip-n-slide if my heart hadn’t felt like it was going to explode. And the chafing. FUCK. No matter how ready either of y’all are when you start out, after two hours, it’s gonna wear off. We both felt like we’d attacked our bits with sandpaper. My poor unfulfilled dick just went through hell for nothing. Not to mention that she just spent two hours with a baby-faced human who couldn\\'t make her come and who might die of cardiac arrest in her basement. This was no climactic movie sex scene. This was a John Waters film come to life. \\n\\nWell, after two hours and no cumming, we called it a night. It\\'s obviously not gonna happen for either of us and we figured we might as well quit while we\\'re ahead and no one has died. We went outside for a smoke and at this point it’s about 6am. I’m wearing only a hoodie and briefs and she’s only in a bathrobe. We sit down and the next thing we know, her mom came out for a cig. (She had just moved back home before finding a new place). So not only did we both just have the worst sexual encounter of our lives, but now I get to meet her mom for the first time! GREAT! I\\'m definitely not half-nude, covered in sweat, and sitting next to her half-nude adult daughter. Somehow she is completely unfazed by this whole encounter and actually starts going on about her most recent Tinder match with a self-proclaimed oil baron. Life is fucking weird.\\n\\nWell, the reason I am posting this on March 14th is because this is our two year anniversary and we’re engaged to be married on March 14th of 2020. Our sex life is FAR better now and we both look back in humor/horror on that night and wonder why the fuck we decided to keep hanging out afterwards. I mean, now we know, but our past selves must have been really really desperate. \\n\\nTL;DR I met up with a Tinder match one night, only to have the worst sex of either of our lives, and met my future mother-in-law right afterwards. Now we’re engaged and celebrating our two year anniversary.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEDIT: Just jumping in to say, holy shit y\\'all, thanks so much for all the congratulations! I am still wholly undecided if I will ever show her this post. It\\'s one thing to tell all our friends about our first hookup, it\\'s another to tell the whole internet. We\\'ll see though. And thank you so much for the gold and silver! Did not expect to be sitting in a classroom, chugging coffee to stay alive, and seeing this thing take off. And for those asking, I\\'ve changed my dosage on my SSRI and haven\\'t really had the anti-climax issue in over a year. Talk to your doctor and see about switching things up if your side effects are causing a huge issue! And also, for those wanting to know about the oil baron. He didn\\'t pan out. Within three months, her mom got hit up by several Tinder guys claiming to be part of the \"oil business\" and we even had to go to the cops about one for a blackmail issue. Tinder can be amazing and terrifying...\\n\\nEDIT2: I guess now I probably have to show this to my fiancée to which she will reply, \"I have no idea what any of that means. Good for you, I guess?\" I still love her.\\n\\nEDIT3: A few of y\\'all keep asking, \"why in TIFU?\" Well, let me tell ya, if I had posted this the day after it happened, this would have been the absolute lowest point of my year. Even worse than my breakup the year before. Not cumming, not making her cum, looking like a large baby man with a chafed dick? Yeah, that sucked. Just because we got together afterwards and look back on the day as our starting point does not mean that that night didn\\'t SUCK ASSSSS on the whole. I mean, the dinner and the movies were still bomb though. Thanks for coming to my TedTalk\\n\\nFINAL EDIT: For real y’all, thank you so much for all the well-wishes and congratulations. I told her about this post when I got home from work today and she cracked the fuck up when I read it to her. We spent the night repeating history (minus the horrible sex) by watching Labyrinth in the driveway with a make-shift Drive-thru theater setup Obligatory on mobile warning. \\n\\nI work at a popular coffee shop in canada, and have been for the last two years. Most customers who come here a lot dont have to order, because we already know it. One guy who comes in orders something distinct, and was very nice to me when I first started.\\n\\n His order was the first I memorized. For example, he orders a large and a medium coffee, but sometimes would just get the large. He came in today for the first time since I started working again from quarantine. I told his order to the girl working the counter with me listing the large and medium coffees, but he ended up just getting the large. Afterwards, my manager told me he wasnt getting the medium anymore because it was his wife\\'s order AND SHE HAD PASSED AWAY. \\n\\nTLDR; I put in the coffee order for a regular that included his deceased wife\\'s regular drink. Okay this literally happened this morning and I am mortified. \\n\\nLast week I booked a fight to see my boyfriend who lives 3 hours away. I don’t drive at the moment so I decided to take a flight as it’s only 40 minutes or so, and it was only €15. We haven’t seen eachother for 3 months because of covid so we were both very excited. Now, to spice things up a lil I decided I will wear lingerie under my regular clothes, as he lives only 10 minutes away from the airport and I thought I could surprise him straight away. I also decided to spice things up a lil and wear a buttplug, not even thinking bout it, so I put it in right before leaving for the airport, I’m gonna spare you the details but it’s a small one so easy to go along your day with. \\n\\nNow, I get to the airport, and while I’m going through the security the things beeps which isn’t a surprise since I’m wearing light jewellery so I didn’t think much of it. The woman tells me to step aside and shes just checking my pockets etc. I take off all my jewellery and try again but the thing is still beeping, and now, I’m only wearing sweatpants, a hoodie, and lingerie with no extra details. So I’m standing there when the woman tells me to go onto an expectation into one of those machine x-ray type things when to my horror I remember I’m wearing a butt plug with a HUGE jewel. Which I completely forgot about. At this stage I am mortified and tell the woman what’s going on. Luckily she just laughed it off and let me go.I have NEVER been this embarrassed.\\n\\nTL;DR I wore a butt plug to the airport and got stopped.\\n\\nEdit ;for everyone asking how I could’ve “forgotten” it there. It’s not that I forgot that it was there or I didn’t feel it was still there, I just got used to the feeling and my mind wasn’t on that when I was entering the security. This happened Sunday night.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy oldest son is in the Marines, hasnt been home in almost a year.  He took 10 days leave so he could come visit.  At first, we did not tell his mother in case the leave got denied. When it was approved he just decided he would fly in and surprise her.  I tell the wife i am going over to a friends to watch the packers/falcons game, as a cover to pick him up.  \\n\\n\\n\\nI get to the airport, and actually watched the second quarter of the game waiting for his plane.  He gets off the plane we talk for a bit waiting for the luggage and then he goes to change into his Dress blues.  Now the whole time ive been texting my wife saying i was bored, the game sucked, i wasnt gonna stay much longer.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe discuss the plan on how to surprise his mother on the drive back to the house.  We go back and forth from having her open the front door to see him on the porch to just having him walk into the house.  We settle on him waiting a few minutes after i go inside, as i wanted to get the whole thing on video.... Free internet points and all that......\\n\\n\\n\\nI walk in and the house is quiet.  No one in the living room.  A little odd but it is after 9pm maybe by some miracle my other kids are actually already in bed?  Alarm bells start going off in my head when i open our bedroom door and the first thing i notice is the flickering candlelight......\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat i did not know was the entire time i was gone, My wife set in motion her own plan for the evening.  She got the kids settled by letting them keep their tablets after bedtime.  Took a nice hot bath, re-did her makeup and when i told her i was on the way home lit the room with candles and put on her \"fuck me\" lingerie.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo no shit there i was, staring at my wife giving me her best come hither look, with our 21 year old son outside not 30 feet away, waiting to Surprise her.  A handful of reactions to this scene are acceptable.  Pulling out your cellphone and sending a text message is not one.  The text told my son to stay outside.  I had solved the most immediate problem of our son walking in and seeing his mother like that but i was drawing a blank on how to fix everything else.  \\n\\n\\n\\nSo my brain latched onto what has to be most stupid plan i have ever had in life.  I told my wife to get dressed because she would never believe what the neighbors were doing and she had to come see.  The look of confusion on her face was priceless.  It took me 5 minutes to convince her to put on some sweatspants and a sweatshirt to go to the front door.  Finally after dodging all her questions and getting her to open the door, There was our son in his dress uniform and She was estatic.  The noise brought all the kids out and everyone was happy.  Except me, the wife excused herself after a few min and took off the lingerie under her sweats before anyone noticed.  It goes without saying i did not get any action that night.  Also in trying to salvage the whole surprise i forgot to video it for my free internet points.  so i guess TIFU will have to suffice instead.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTL;DR  Didn\\'t tell Wife that Marine son was coming home, Missed out on Sexy times and the second half of the Packers/Falcons game\\n\\n\\n\\nedit 1: Goldx2? wow thank you guys.  this one post has more upvotes than my 4 year old main account.\\n\\nUpdate: Wife is freaking out that i put this on reddit.  Have been reading some of the comments to her this morning.  She is worried that this story will end up in one of her Marine Moms FB groups and they somehow will magically know it was her lol.    Son wants to take his siblings out for ice cream and the new lego movie, cross your fingers people.\\n\\n \\nI’m a third-year medical student on my gynecology clerkship “assisting” on a laparoscopic hysterectomy. In this procedure the abdomen is pressurized while the surgeon inserts several instruments to ligate and remove the uterus. If you can imagine, maintaining pressure in the abdomen after you remove the uterus is difficult because, you know, air just freely escapes...from the vagina. As this was my first laparoscopic surgery, I soon found out that my role was to place a rubber stopper in the vagina to prevent air from escaping. Like many of you, I had no idea this role even existed, but I quickly accepted my new job as ‘vagina sealer’. I approached from the bottom of the table and stuck my hands underneath the sterile drapes that covered the legs. I placed the rubber ball in the vagina and stood there trying not to make eye contact with anyone in the room. After several minutes, the pressure in the abdomen continued to decrease.  The attending physician, frustrated at this point, walked around next to me, ripped the drape in half to reveal the pelvic area, and said “do you know where the vagina is? Get that stopper out of her ass!”\\n\\nThank you for reading. I’ll go die now. \\n\\nTL;DR  couldn’t see under the sterile drapes when placing a rubber stopper in the vagina during surgery and accidentally placed it in the rectum One of my favorite video game series of all times is the Yakuza series. The narrative, gameplay, everything about it I absolutely love. I bought Yakuza 0 a few days back, as it is the only game in the series I have not yet played. I bought it off the PSN Store for $9.99!! I\\'m absolutely in love with it.\\n\\nSo yesterday I was having a conversation with one of my online gaming friends. I was telling him all about the game, how much I loved it, etc. Well he expressed interest in wanting to play it too! Money is pretty tight for him, so I offered to PayPal him the money to get it. He did his usual polite \"oh no it\\'s fine I\\'m sure I have some extra money I can use to get it\". Well I PayPal\\'d him the money for the game plus a little extra for food or whatever he wanted. PayPal gives you the option to send a message along with the money. Me, in my infinite wisdom, sent the message \"SHUT UP AND TAKE MY YAKUZA MONEY\". \\n\\nApparently, when sending money to someone online, using the name of an organized crime syndicate is not the best thing to do. PayPal does not send the money, and tells me my payment is pending while it undergoes an investigation, and that the process will take no more than 72 hours. Fast forward to tonight, I get an email from PayPal saying that they have now restricted my access to my account and that I have to go through steps to resolve the process. \\n\\nI follow their link, and there is the payment in question. In the text box provided, I then have to explain to them the context of the message and that the money is for a game called Yakuza 0, and that I, a US Citizen who does not have a passport and has never been out of the country, never arrested or even pulled over, am not a member of the Japanese Yakuza.\\n\\nI am now waiting for PayPal to review my written statement and hopefully this is all resolved.\\n\\nTL;DR I used the word \"Yakuza\" in a PayPal transaction and now paypal thinks I am a member of the Yakuza\\n\\nEdit: WOW This is my first post that has ever taken off, I was not expecting to wake up to this. Thank you all the support and for my first reddit gold as well! I\\'m glad you all found this entertaining!\\n\\nEdit 2: WE MADE IT TO THE FRONT PAGE I admit I posted a version of this on the relationship subreddit the other day, but they closed it with no explanation, I assume because they just decided it was fake. I can see how they might think that, but this is a true thing that happened and is happening, and now there is more to it because I actually got broken up with over it. \\n\\nWith all that is going on, we had stocked up on supplies, including some canned goods. I ordered a few weeks ago 30 cans of beans. 10 are black beans, 10 are kidney beans, and 10 are pink beans. Also, I ordered 15 cans of chickpeas. I thought this is a reasonable amount of beans and chickpeas to have every now and then and would last for quite some time. \\n\\nHowever earlier this week I opened the cabinet because I wanted to make a vegetarian chili using two cans of beans, but all of the beans were gone. What the hell? \\n\\nI asked my girlfriend and she told me she buried all of the beans in the woods. \\n\\nAt first I thought she was joking, but she explained, no, she had buried the beans in the woods. WTF? \\n\\nI asked her to explain and she told me she was afraid that \"if things get bad\" we might have to worry about \"looters or whatever\" and that the beans would be in danger of being stolen. I said I thought this was completely ridiculous and unlikely. She became angry at me and said she \"is protecting our beans.\" \\n\\nAccording to her logic, the beans are safely buried in the woods behind our apartment complex, and if we ever need some beans she will go to the \"stash\" and dig up a can or two, but would prefer if we save them all for \"if things get worse\". \\n\\nI said why only bury the beans, why not bury our more valuable items? She said the canned food was most valuable for long-term means, and that since we get fresh food in our online grocery deliveries, it would make sense to continue to stockpile beans. She intends to go bury more beans in the woods every week. \\n\\nThis was too insane for me and I got very upset. I demanded to know where the beans were buried, and she refused to tell me. She said if I knew she was afraid I\\'d dig them up, I said damn right I would. She said \"I will never jeopardize the beans.\" \\n\\nThe following day I tried to put my foot down, and I\\'m not usually a foot downer but there are rare issues where compromise is out of the question, and I foolishly decided this was one of those issues. I demanded to know where the beans were buried and I told her if she was going to bury beans I paid for in the woods that I would move out. We fought about it and I kept insisting. \\n\\nIn hindsight I should have just let it go and created my own hidden stash of beans in the apartment, and given her time to maybe cool down about this bean burying scenario, but I blew it all out of proportion. Yeah it\\'s weird to bury beans in the woods but why did I have to press it? What\\'s the harm at the end of the day? In the grand scheme of things? But I kept demanding her to take me to the beans, or at least draw a map or something, and finally she BROKE UP WITH ME. Over the beans. I have lost the love of my life because I couldn\\'t let the damn beans go. I am in disbelief. She moved out. Not only am I heartbroken but I am now paying full rent instead of 50% which is a huge financial issue for me. \\n\\nTL;DR - I kept demanding that my girlfriend show me where she buried the beans in the woods and she got so angry at me that she ended our relationship and moved out. My heart is shattered and my finances are jeopardized because of a bean hoard. I\\'m in my third year of University taking engineering so this is a little extra embarrassing considering my streak of never being \"that person\" in the wrong class. To start the semester I ended up missing the first week of school because I was on a last minute trip with my friends. It was completely unplanned and actually a few of my friends who had graduated helped chip to buy my ticket since I technically couldn\\'t afford to go.\\n\\nAnyway, I came into class a week late and it is scheduled for tuesdays and thursdays at 7-8:15pm. On both those days I have classes all day until 2pm so I usually go home to eat and grab a snooze before the night class. So my first tuesday home I ended up over sleeping and turning up to class five minutes late. So as part of my degree I have to take microeconomics which all I knew about it previously was it\\'s about the economy and money. When I get to class they\\'re talking about supply and demand curves shifting so I just take a spot in the back not thinking twice.\\n\\nThis goes on for 3.5 weeks. I came to class. Took notes. Then did the weekly assignments. On the course syllabus it had a date for the midterm which is Febuary 1st. So the class before the exam, January 30th, I decided to stick around after class and ask some questions. Now I was doing all the assignments and thought the course material was relevant but it was ALL theory based while the class was heavy math based. I understood what was going on but there was obviously some disconnect. I explained my concerns about the midterm to the prof and the conversation went like this:\\n\\n*Explains above about material*\\nProf: \"What do you mean theory? All the assignments are filled with math. Are you using launchpad?\"\\nMe: \"No the assignments are online. Like the website we bought the textbook from. Whats lauchpad?\"\\nProf: \"Pardon? I don\\'t have a textbook for this course.\"\\nMe: \"It literally says in the syllabus, look!\"\\n*Shows syllabus*\\nProf: \"Wait, what class are you supposed to be in?\"\\nMe: \"What do you mean...? This is ECON 202 right?\"\\n*Prof starts laughing*\\nProf: \"Haha this is ECON 301, you have to take 202 before you take my class. This is a new one, I\\'ve never experienced this before.\"\\nMe: \"Well this is awkward. I better go see my actual teacher and explain.\"\\n\\nI then just grabbed my stuff real quick and sprinted through campus to go explain the situation to the other guy. I caught him just as he was leaving lecture and explain my predicament. Even showed him my ECON 301 notes to prove I couldn\\'t make this shit up. He just laughed and said the same thing \"This is a new one for me.\" Turns out all the assignments for both classes were due the same day. Same with the midterms. They were relevant because it was obviously a level above what I was supposed to be doing and the only thing I got wrong was the building code. They were both classroom 112, just different buildings. So basically I just spent the last 2 nights forgetting everything from this class all month and learning the real material. Wish me luck tomorrow!\\n\\nTldr; I was in the wrong econ class for an entire month until I finally realized. Then had to cram for 2 nights for a midterm. Crazy coicidences all around.\\n\\nEdit: Well shit, went to sleep and woke up from a friend texting me saying \"You made the front page you motherfucker hahahahahaha\". The exam is in a couple hours and I will update you on my grade but to clear up some of the comments:\\n\\n1. Ya, the trip wasn\\'t the smartest but I had fun and went to Tiesto\\'s birthday in Vegas amongst other kool stuff. Life goes on.\\n\\n2. I was doing the assignments for the actual class with some help from my good buddy google and I had the actual textbook (pirated, no one buys textbooks c\\'mon). So I do have a grasp of whats going on\\n.. kinda. He did everything on the board and there were online notes but I figured you did practical application in class and the online notes (actually for my 202 class) were for reference purposes. \\n\\n3. I highly doubt i\\'ll fail the course or the midterm. It\\'s amazing how much you can learn in 24 hours with enough caffeine and fear in your belly. I\\'ve made it through almost 3 years of engineering so I\\'m sure it will turn out fine. It\\'ll be a funny story at grad when I get my ring.\\n\\nThanks for all the support too. :) Making the front page of reddit just adds to how sweet 2018\\'s been (no sarcasm) and this is just a minor set back.\\n\\nEdit 2: Just got back from the exam.. I didn\\'t crush it but there is no way I didn\\'t pass. It was twenty multiple choice and 2 five mark short answer questions. The prof also stopped me leaving the exam and said \"I usually don\\'t tell students this until before the 2nd midterm but if you score better on the final and second midterm I will take the average to make up that first exam.\" So all in all I survived and live to fight another day.\\n\\nJust wanted to say thanks for all the kind words and hilarious stories. I will start going through my inbox and try to reply to some people. In the words of one of my good friends giving me advice in first year eng:\\n\\n\"Literally everyone in eng at multiple, multiple points feel like their gonna fail and life\\'s over. But somehow they keep going and that is the circle of eng life.\" - CZ\\n\\np.s: for textbook help... IG: @redditecon202\\n Long time Reddit reader, first time making an account because i am currently stuck in my girlfriends room while she and her family are having dinner downstairs. I haven\\'t eaten since morning nor showered and I need to take a shit.\\n\\nBack story to this morning, since the lockdown for covid 19 happened, I haven\\'t seen my girlfriend for over month plus. Our government recently relaxed the quarantine so we are allowed to go out but not loiter. Woke up to my girlfriend\\'s call around 11am saying that her parents went out to get something. I thought okay I\\'ll come over, return her a camera I borrowed and maybe we can sit in my car around her neighbourhood and hangout awhile. It was a little rushed as her parents just left her house as I left mine. I\\'m about 20 min away from her place. She assured me her parents will be out for at least 1 and a half hours as they need to get lunch. I drove as fast as I could and picked her up from the front of the house and we drove to park nearby to hangout. After a couple of minutes, I ask if she brought some water as I asked her about it before I came and she said no. She said why don\\'t you come in and take some water since her parents will still be far away. I said yes (obviously) and went in, drank water and we sat on the couch for awhile to cuddle. \\n\\nI was a little paranoid but I haven\\'t seen her in a long time so i needed it. About 10 min, we hear a car outside her house and that\\'s how tifu, it was her parents. They were only out for 40 min. FML we panicked. Luckily I parked away from her house and took my slippers in. I contemplated just owning up and lying that I needed to use the toilet but her mom is really difficult. She would assume my girlfriend was lying and get her trouble and I haven\\'t even met her parents officially as her boyfriend yet. If you are from an Asian family or have heard of asian parents being strict about relationships, it\\'s true.\\n\\nWe both ran up to her room and I hid behind her door. Mind you, her room is really small. Its about the siZe of two single beds. Can\\'t hide under the bed as she has to keep her door open and you can see straight under her bed from the stairs. The only place possible is behind her door. I stood there frozen af as she went down to greet her parents. I could here them coming in as I hugged the wall as tightly as I could. \\n\\nShe came back up freaking out but I said it\\'s okay. Let\\'s just try formulate a plan. She said okay and she went down to eat with them first. Which I had then had to stay as silent a possible with no fan or air-conditioning so I sweated my ass off. \\n\\n1 pm ish. She comes back up and we try to listen whether her parents are coming up or not. They usually sit downstairs after lunch and nap, which they did. Gave me a little bit of relief as I could sit down in the floor. The space in between the door and her table is super tiny which is uncomfortable but I\\'m not complaining. \\n\\n2pm. Her dad comes up to shower and her door is right next to the bath area. Fuck I can hear the water rushing. But good news my girlfriend is in the room doing her work so she can look out. Its weird as I\\'m just standing up behind the door and looking at her look back at me. After his shower, her dad leaves to go to his store which leaves her mom downstairs. She gets on a long phone call which gives me a bit of room to relax. My girlfriend and I make out a bit to calm our nerves and I gotta say it did help. \\n\\nFor the next three hours, her mom stays downstairs and we try to formulate a plan but everything involves the timing of her parents which is impossible. Can\\'t jump out the window cause it\\'s grilled and she doesn\\'t have the key...\\n\\nAround 5.30pm ish, her dad comes home and almost fucking COMES INTO HER ROOM. He asks her to print something and she quickly walks to her door to stop him from coming in. I hear his voice right outside the door. Thankfully he walks away and goes down to watch TV. And I swear to god the universe wants us to suffer because right after that her mom comes upstairs and hangs about the common area. My girls had recorded a zoom meeting so she tells her mom she has a meeting and plays it and closing the door giving my legs much needed rest and I sit.\\n\\n7pm, her mom calls her from downstairs that it\\'s time to eat. And that\\'s where we are at now. Its currently 9pm at this sentence and I can hear her family talking to each other. She has to turn off the lights and fan and air-conditioning so I\\'m freaking drenched in my sweat in the dark. I\\'m sitting down but I\\'ve got pins and needles in my feet now. I would stand up but because the area is so tight, I don\\'t want to risk any noise. Oh remember how I haven\\'t eaten and need to shit? That\\'s attacking now. My stomach is growling and I\\'m making fart noises. I\\'m so scared to be caught cause my parents are gonna slaughter me too. My girlfriend and I will discuss our plans for me to escape when she comes up...\\n\\nUPDATE 1: they are done with dinner. My girlfriend brought me some water and biscuits but I don\\'t have the appetite to eat. Don\\'t want to drink too much as I would risk needing to go to the toilet. She went back to do the dishes\\n\\nUPDATE 2: its 9pm and my girlfriend is in her room. She told her family she is playing animal crossing with her friends so hopefully her parents don\\'t barge it. We\\'re gonna formulate a plan for me to escape now. I can finally stretch my legs\\n\\nUPDATE 3: WE HAVE A PLAN. 9.30pm\\nWe\\'re going to wait for their parents to head up to their room. She\\'s going to check if their door is closed and where they are looking at it. She\\'ll bring me downstairs and I\\'ll hide in the storeroom. She\\'ll then go and tell her parents she\\'s taking photos of the night and no worry if the door alarm rings (cause they have an alarm system in place). She\\'ll unlock the main door, the outside small gate and leave it open for abit (gated and guarded area so it\\'s pretty safe). She\\'ll go check on her parents as they like to look at what she is doing from their room. Once she\\'s confirmed they are not looking, she\\'ll get me from the storeroom, I\\'ll go all the way out and hide behind a pillar in front of her house. She\\'ll lock everything and go back up and check her parents are not looking out and I\\'ll walk to my car (so I don\\'t startle her dog). Sounds pretty legit as she knows her parents schedule the best\\n\\nUPDATE 4: 9:41 pm. Showed my girlfriend this post and we\\'re reading the comments. Really means a lot to us that everyone is supportive. Makes the nerves less frightening. We\\'re hugging it out and playing Animal Crossing till her parents go to sleep at around 11\\n\\nUPDATE 5: I\\'m still here and it\\'s around 10.30. my time zone is GMT +8 for those who are still invested. We\\'re just preparing for when her parents go to bed so we\\'re trying to calm our nerves\\n \\nUPDATE 6: it\\'s 11 but her parents are not sleeping. For some strange reason her mom decided to bake at like 10.30. starting to think they suspect something \\n\\nUPDATE 7:SHIT YES! my gf just went to down and her mom is done baking and says she is going to sleep soon. Which just leaves her dad still watching TV. I\\'m almost out I can feel the wind already. Just can\\'t get too trigger happy and jump the gun. \\n\\nUPDATE 8: FFFK. her mom just walked past her room. Heading into her own room. Her dad also getting ready to sleep. Shit is about to happen guys. Phase one of our plan is about to commence! \\n\\nUPDATE 9: damn, her mom went to bed but her dad is still watching TV. It\\'s like 11:30pm and he is still watching? At least her mom is in her room so that is good.\\n\\nUPDATE 10: OKAY plan is in action. Her dad is now in their room and she is moving my stuff downstairs to the storeroom. I\\'ll update once I\\'m inside\\n\\nUDPATE 11: took my last sip of water and went down to the storeroom. Phase 1 complete. Her dad is showering, her parents door is closed. Now for the front door and gat\\n\\nupda12: gf opening the door and the gate. I have to wait for her\\n\\n13: slight change, I went out the door together with her. Her dog isn\\'t barking so that\\'s good. She has to open the gate\\n\\n14. Out the gate. Bending down. Waiting for her text me\\n\\n15. She\\'s taking some photos to sell the story. Better not rush it. Her dog is getting very close to me and sniffing me thought the gate. Oh god please don\\'t bark\\n\\nFINAL UPDATE:\\n\\nFUCKING HELL GUYS. I made it. I just started the engine and my heart is pounding. I\\'m safe and sound. TIME TO GO HOME. Got out 11:53\\n\\nPOST CLARIFICATION:\\n\\nIts 12.15am, I\\'m home sipping a hot cup of Milo and laughing with my girlfriend about the entire day. We just wanna thank everyone that supported us and this shitty situation we put ourselves in. The nerves were real and seeing how everyone wanted the best for us really helped us push through this emotionally. Wanted to clarify a few things for quite a number of questions:\\n\\n1. A lot of people were saying this story is a fake a similar to other \"stuck in ___ room with family in house\". Unfortunately, Asian people go through similar things and this is no exception. The strict family and rebellious child senario. Same coin, different sides.\\n\\n2. A few people mentioned how this is similar to another post a year a go and truth is, I was inspired by that post to share this story. It was a very emotionally troubling time for both of us and after reading the mentioned post and seeing how supportive everyone was and how it made the OP feel much better, I thought it would a good idea for my girlfriend and I to do the same. And it did! It honestly helped us feel like we could make this work. I\\'m really sorry I can\\'t prove it happened but this was real to the both of us and that\\'s more important.\\n\\n3. We own up to this mistake and that\\'s why it\\'s on tifu. We fucked up big time and have only ourselves to blame. But we survived it learnt never to repeat it again. \\n\\nADD:\\n\\n4. Situation happened in Malaysia. Its a very hot and humid country so it\\'s very common for people to shower more than once or twice a day and sometimes before we sleep.\\n\\n5. We\\'re Chinese. \\n\\n6. This is the most amusing part and I\\'m glad everyone was worried about it: yes. I did take a shit after I ate. It was brutal. Constipation due to the lack of water. Not only were my legs shaking, my asshole hurt too. Not fun.\\n\\n7. 4pm (next day) Oh god, this is still going on in the comments but I wanted to add something after my gf went through the comments. To those who opened up about similar stories about hiding or having strict parents (i.e. no friends over or always under watch), it really meant a lot to her that there are other people who go through the same thing as her and I would like to thank you for sharing! She always felt like the odd one out of her friends. Not being able to go out, tight rules etc and it\\'s good to know she isn\\'t the only one. Some people don\\'t understand this and that\\'s fine. Everyone grows up in different scenarios. Its not that she doesn\\'t love her parents less, it just sucks to be in her situation. I wish I could give her more credit for what happened last night. She risked so much just for us to see each other. \\n\\n\\nThank you again for investing your time in this. Didn\\'t expect it to blow up like this but you guys helped us a lot. Time to sleep now. Good night everyone!!!\\n\\n\\nTL ; DR : came over to my girlfriends house to see her and her parents suddenly came home and now I am hiding in her room as her family is eating downstairs My sisters battery was dead and so she asked if she could login to Reddit on my phone to check if she had a reply from a ForHire post. \\n\\nShe took my phone, logged in and sent a few messages and then logged out and gave me my phone back.\\n\\nThe TIFU started around 20 minutes later when I started receiving notifications from Reddit for posts that I can\\'t remember visiting, they were also NSFW so I went to the bathroom for some privacy to see what the posts were about and to turn the notifications off.\\n\\nThe notifications were messages and comment replies from a NSFW amateur subreddit, curiosity got the better of me and upon clicking onto the post, there was my younger sister naked!\\n\\nI immediately closed it and decided to logout of her account but realised her account wasn\\'t logged in, it\\'s some sort of bug with the Reddit app that causes me to receive notifications for an account that has recently been logged in on my phone.\\n\\nThe notifications are still coming through thick and fast and I\\'ve since realised my sister is quite a popular amateur pornstar on Reddit and I wish that I never found this out.\\n\\nTLDR: Let my younger sister use my phone to check her Reddit inbox, found out that her side hustle is that she\\'s a popular amateur pornstar on Reddit and I\\'m getting notifications for comments on my sisters vagina. so today I had one of the most uncomfortable moments of my adult life, I’m still dealing with the repercussions of it all but fuck me if it doesn’t make one hell of a story for you all\\n\\nokay so for a bit of back story I’m 27 and I live with my girlfriend, we’ve been together for 2 years now and through out that time I’ve seen her parents roughly 3 or 4 times, a couple years before we met they both retired and now they live in a different country on top of that they’re usually travelling so it’s a little harder to spend time with them. Now an important part of this story is my girlfriend and I for about a year now have been making amateur porn, before we met she was a cam model and after about a year of our relationship we decided we were both comfortable making video content together, we make a fair amount of money and both enjoy it a lot. We’ve also managed to keep our sex work careers hidden from our families... up until this morning that is....\\n\\nSo on top of making porn I’m also an aspiring film editor and I am an editor for a couple different youtubers (gotta start somewhere) but I also edit our content and the night before my girlfriends parents came to stay with us I’d been editing a new video, usually after editing I go through and watch the edit to make sure there were no little mistakes left in.\\n\\nnow fast forward to today my girlfriends parents are coming to stay with us for the week, around midday they arrived and everything was going great which was relieving because I’d always got the vibe they didn’t like me very much. We were all sat in our living room watching a film when my girlfriends dad asked if he could use my laptop to access his emails because his phone was having issues, I immediately said sure and led him into the office, now I could have just brought him the laptop but my laptop is hooked up to some quite expensive studio monitors and her dad is very much into audio and I kinda wanted to show them off to him and talk about music with him. So I lead him into the office and almost instantly he notices the monitors and starts talking about how much he loves them and we got distracted talking about them until a couple minutes passed and he brought up his emails again, he sat down in front of my desk as I opened my laptop and entered the password only for one of mine and his daughters videos to start playing on the screen in front of him and not just any video it was a video of his beautiful first born daughter, his pride and joy, the apple of his eye riding a floor mounted dildo whilst I ejaculated on her face, if that’s not bad enough the monitors had been left on and the audio of us both moaning was loud enough for her mother to hear in the living room.\\n\\nI panicked and shut the laptop but the audio still continued to play for at least 5 seconds after closing it, her dad then proceeded to pretend to get a call and made his way outside shortly after her mom went outside and they began to have an argument, about an hour later her mom came in and said that her dad was feeling unwell so they booked a hotel in case it was contagious because she didn’t want her dad getting us sick also.\\n\\nHer dad has not spoken to either of us since leaving and my girlfriend and I are both unbelievably embarrassed and nervous about having dinner with then in 2 days but I hope you guys get some enjoyment out of this and I’ll keep you updated if anything else happens \\n\\n\\n\\nTL;DR I unintentionally showed my girlfriends dad a video of me cumming on her face and now he won’t talk to us\\n\\nUPDATE: a couple of you have asked questions about the laptop situation so I’ll explain, as I said earlier in the post I watch the video post editing to make sure there’s no problems before uploading, before going to sleep I just shut the laptop without even thinking, I do this often (I know it’s not good but sshh) if you don’t stop playing a video before closing it will start playing upon opening again. Still haven’t heard from her dad yet. I honestly didn’t expect this to get this big but your comments have made my girl and I laugh a lot so thank you\\n\\nUPDATE 2: thank you all for participating in a social experiment stay tuned\\n\\nhow ya doon Dani This happened a year ago, but I just remembered this horrific event and the poor victims that never fully recovered. I was set to go on an 10 hour road trip through the interior of British Columbia and with me were 2 of my cousins and my uncle. However, before our 6am start I decided the night before to wolf down these chocolate chip Fiber One granola bars that had something like 75% of your daily fiber intake. These things were crazy good and I ended up eating an entire 8 pack of them in one sitting. After that I went to sleep and woke up in the morning to a bloated stomach but felt fine otherwise. 45 minutes into our ride the cramps began. My stomach grew larger and larger and I ended up needing to remove my seatbelt, and undoing the zipper on my jeans to give it more space to expand. My cousin next to me couldn\\'t believe what he was seeing, he said it was like the blueberry scene from Willy Wonka. I couldn\\'t hold the gas in any longer and asked my uncle to pull over, which he did and I struggled to get out of my seat as every move was agony. I waddled to the back of the car and let her rip. A thunderous roar escaped me like an asshole racing his Harley Davidson around the block on a Sunday Morning. The gas hissed out of me as my stomach grumbled, shuffled and shuttered. I am not exagerrating when I tell you that this fart lasted AT LEAST 15 seconds. Little did I know that I had just broken the seal and I would proceed to experience uncontrollable and obnoxiously powerful farts that lasted 10-15 seconds on average, with only a brief period of relief between said farts. \\n\\nThe fact of the matter was that I was now experiencing major flatulence every 2 to 3 minutes, and we couldn\\'t stop the car every few minutes to escape the smell, so we decided to roll all the windows down and allow me to let loose whenever I needed. However, we had no idea that this would become a much longer ordeal than we initially thought. Truth be told, I couldn\\'t stop farting for nearly 7 hours, and each fart just HAD to be more epic than the last. By the time hour 2 rolled around, my anus was sore and aching, and my insides feeling like shards of glass were ripping through me. And the smell had become so overpowering that we had to stop at a gas station and buy as many air fresheners as we could. I took one of the air fresheners and sat on it in the hopes that each fart will be freshened up - instead it just smelt like rotten eggs and pine. My cousins and uncle resorted to using Vicks around their noses to stop the smell. The pain from constantly farting brought me to tears at one point and I realized how ridiculous it must look to see a grown man crying while farting non stop.\\n\\nAt hour 4 disaster struck. I stopped farting, but I was still swelling with gas. I knew I was plugged up and if I didn\\'t do something soon the pain is going to become unbearable. We stopped at a Coffee Shop and I ran in to use the bathroom. I gingerly sat down on the toilet and gently pushed but the pain was too much. I resorted to pushing on my stomach to help things along and suddenly I felt this wave of pressure hit me that made my butt cheeks break into a cold sweat and start to tingle. Suddenly, and without warning, a rock hard turd rocketed out of me like a cannonball and plastered itself to the back of the toilet bowl, and with that this tidal wave of what could only be described as peanut butter oatmeal. I could feel the muscles in my abdomen squeezing my intestines so hard that it actually hurt. It was like when you are throwing up and you can feel your stomach violently squish itself to push everything out, but instead it was my butt that was throwing up. Once everything was pushed out it was topped off by the longest fart in my short, pathetic existence, one that I could never accurately give the length other than say well over 20 seconds, and that I could literally feel and see my stomach shrinking. I destroyed that poor coffee shop bathroom and I frequently wonder what happened to the person who wandered in after me.\\n\\nFrom that point forward the farts were just as frequent and long, but they felt cleaner and less restricted. It began to feel like I was airing my colon out, blowing out all the accumulated dust. My ribs and anus ached horribly, but I was starting to feel euphoria wash over me that I assumed was just the endorphin rush my body was giving as a way to protect my fragile mind from this ridiculous ordeal. By the time hour 7 rolled around my farts had slowly faded away, but the smell permeated my clothes and the seat behind me. The family had gone through almost an entire container of Vicks, and they appeared to have survived the ordeal but I could tell that a part of them was broken that could never be fixed. It was as though they felt violated by having to breathe in my butt breath for 7 hours, and I knew my uncle was upset that his car\\'s interior would never smell the same again, as it already smelled like hot garbage by this point.\\n\\nWe eventually arrived without incident, and we refused to speak of this event. Things were never really the same between all of us after that, and I have a feeling none of us will ever touch eggs ever again. They already ate enough of my farts, they don\\'t need a reminder. I should have never eaten that much fiber. I had no idea it was capable of that.\\n\\nTL;DR -  I ate too many fiber bars and ended up gassing my family nearly to death over 7 hours in a car. I made the scientific discovery that your body can produce ridiculously large farts at an alarming rate. 15 second farts on average with an average rate of 1 fart every 3 minutes. That means I was farting an average of 300 seconds an hour, or 2100 seconds over 7 hours. I farted for 35 minutes. LMAO\\n\\nEdit: I am glad that we can all laugh at my Fart Attack and the pain and suffering that comes from it, but please don\\'t do what I did. I was a dumbass that couldn\\'t stop eating chocolate, and what I did was dangerous. I\\'m certain you will only hurt yourself if you attempt this so please do not try this.\\n\\nAlso I meant to individually thank people for awards via inbox but I lost count after 30 and decided to just say thank you from here. Thank you, from here. Edit: Edit: I spoke up and got more numbing agent after like two minuets. It’s in the other edit, but I’m putting this up here for visibility since it’s come up in a lot of messages. Also, all y’all getting political and sending angry PMs, chill.\\n\\nI have been following the election all day, every day waiting for a victory announcement. I had an appointment this morning to get a filling replaced and of course, the second I leave my apartment the fireworks and cheering start so I check my phone and lo and behold Biden has claimed Pennsylvania.\\n\\nAnyway, I finish my walk to the dentist\\'s office, I\\'m in the chair, and the dentist and his assistant come in. I just say, \"It looks like they\\'ve called the election for Biden\" with no indication of preference one way or another. I was going to mention how I missed the news announcement and leave it at that. Instead, as soon as I mention it the dentist gets a look of total defeat on his face and then starts going off, calmly, about how the machines were having errors in MI, fake ballots, voter fraud, and having to recount all the states or something. At this point he has proceeded to drill my mouth, not fully numb, ~~terrified and~~ in pain.  ~~I\\'ve never been more scared in my life~~  worried that I upset the guy working on my mouth. (edited again for clarity)\\n\\nTLDR; I upset my dentist right before a filling by telling him Biden won the election. It hurt.\\n\\nEdit: So this exploded. Also, I just want to add based on a lot of the comments, the dentist was never angry or malicious. They were just calmly explaining their “theories” while operating, to the assistant. Definitely distracted, which is why I think I didn’t get enough numbing agent at first, but nothing to file any complaints about. I also asked for more numbing agent after a few minuets and things were fine after that. *Throwaway because I no longer have a Reddit account.*\\n\\nMasturbated in the shower this morning. Vigorous stroking triggered an asthma attack. Asthma attack prompted me to exit the shower. Exiting the shower ended with me slipping and falling on my face. Called my roommate for help. Roommate found me naked on the floor, struggling to breathe. Cue roommate retrieving my inhaler. Inhaler failed to do the job after multiple attempts. Condition worsened.\\n\\nAmbulance was called. Roommate awkwardly helped me into my clothes. Paramedics showed up and put me on a nebuliser. Nebuliser helped me breathe, but little did I know the worst was yet to come. Paramedics said I had a fever and transported me to hospital. Hospital flagged me as a potential Covid case. Got placed in quarantine by nurses dressed up for Chernobyl. Got treated for my fever and tested for the virus. Speaking of the test, never again do I want those long ass swabs shoved down my throat again - it was so damn deep it practically touched my brain. Doctor conducted a thorough checkup. I winced when said doctor pressed on my stomach. Doctor narrowed her eyes and asked what the colour of my poop was. I said \"kinda dark but, you know, not outer space dark\". Doctor said \"hm\" before proceeding to spread my ass cheeks and jam her lubricated finger into my anus. For the record, that finger was thick as fuck and it happened to be the first time ever something penetrated me down there.\\n\\nGot discharged with a laundry list of prescribed medications and advised to self isolate until I recieve my test results. As of today, the thought of fapping has become nothing more than a source of nightmare fuel, and the feeling of being finger fucked in the b-hole is yet to disappear. \\n\\n**TL:DR Fapping triggered my body to self destruct. Now I might be positive for the virus while having a phantom finger stirring the inside of my asshole, as well as World War 2 level flashbacks every time I wanna bust a nut.** [THE UPDATE!!](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c682li/tifu_update_deepthroating_myself_in_front_of_my/)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOhhhhh where do I begin. This happened this weekend.\\n\\nLet\\'s lay out some plot points first..\\n\\n\\\\-I\\'m 37 years old and recently dating a girl for a couple of months. She is 26.\\n\\n\\\\-I work as a film editor, and often have new assistant editors for different projects. I\\'ve recently started on a new project and have a new assistant who is a 27 year old woman.\\n\\n\\\\-I\\'ve always worked out, done yoga, I\\'m fit and slim, and have an above average sized dick. This combination has given me the unique talent of being able to suck my own dick. I\\'ve been doing this for many many years, all of my partners have always found this amusing and arousing. I know there are dangers, yada yada yada, but trust me, I\\'ve done it a lot and I know what I\\'m doing, lol.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOKAY. So, the girl I am dating is very fond of this talent, and told her group of friends about it. One of whom is getting married soon. She was doing her bachelor party, and instead of hiring the beefcake stripper, her friends wanted to see me suck my own cock. I was a little put off by the idea at first, doing this for a group of strangers, but the idea was kind of hot, and it\\'s all in good fun, so fuck it, right? I agree to the plan. I was a little nervous about meeting them first, making too much eye contact, etc, so we came up with the best plan to make this happen.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThere are a few methods to doing this, the easiest and um, \"deepest\" of which is to put my legs over my head. This way, I would be looking up, and wouldn\\'t really have to look at any of the girls. But the could see full view of my cock going into mouth. (I can draw a diagram if needed.)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo the day comes, I have a couple of shots of tequila to loosen up. By the time I arrive the girls are already pretty tipsy and rowdy, chanting things like \"suck your dick!\" from the other room. I prepare myself with the girl I\\'m dating, and she invites her friends in. They are hooting and hollaring as I\\'m laying on the ground with a very erect cock. The whole thing is actually pretty hot, and even though my heart is racing like mad, I\\'m really into this idea now.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI throw my legs over my head as I\\'ve done many time, and start to play along with the \"show\"... I circle my tongue around the tip, teasing myself. I put myself further and the head goes in my mouth and I hear the ghasps and woo\\'s and girl noises coming from behind me. I\\'m trying to look back to see them, but I\\'m a bit focused on the cock in my mouth and really can\\'t see past my head. I start getting more and more into it, and the girl I\\'m dating comes over and helps me push it deeper into my mouth by pushing my ass and legs down, as we\\'ve done before in our own private world. At this point I\\'m really into and sucking my cock like a champ. The girls really seem to be enjoying it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAfter a some minutes go by (not sure how long), they start chanting \"Cum in your mouth! Cum in your mouth!\"... Now to be clear, I normally don\\'t do this. I have before, lol, but it\\'s not my thing. But I\\'m the entertainment, and I aim to please, so in my mind I\\'m thinking lets do this. I start sucking harder, tongue playing with the tip. The girl I\\'m dating is still pushing me a bit, her hand on my ass. The whole thing is so hot and I feel like I\\'m about to cum, and.....explode. It was a lot. I\\'m shaking and convulsing sucking my tip, they are clapping and cheering. The girl I\\'m dating let\\'s go of my legs and I fall down, sweating, with a mouthful of cum. Her friends start to yell -- \"kiss him!\" \"cum swap!\" - I\\'m actually not sure what they were yelling but it was along those lines. So I stand up, in a daze, and kiss her, she takes the cum from my mouth, and I look finally at the girls all in joy, except one unbelievably shocked and mortified face - you know where this is going of course. My assistant.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nShe leaves the room, I race to the bathroom. The girl I\\'m dating comes in to ask me what is wrong and I tell her. She loses it laughing - \"SO AND SO is your assistant?! AHAHAHAH\". I\\'m not laughing. Assistant isn\\'t laughing and actually leaves the party.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt\\'s actually a bit of a scene, the girl I\\'m dating tells her friends, there is laughter, discussion, they are calling Assistant and she is not answering. The girl I\\'m dating assures me they are all like this, this is no big deal.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'ve been working from home all week. I\\'ve talked to my assistant via Slack and we\\'ve said nothing. She is in the office. I can\\'t work from home tomorrow. I DON\\'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK TO DO. The girl I\\'m dating said that Assistant is mortified, and doesn\\'t know what to do either. I really don\\'t know what the fuck to do.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\ntl:dr - I sucked my own dick at a bachelorette party, at which my new assistant was in attendance. We haven\\'t spoken about it since.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT:  [The diagram](https://imgur.com/a/rR31eBi)!  I\\'m a terrible artist, forgive me.  I\\'m not a turkey, I promise.\\n\\nEDIT 2: To clarify, I don\\'t think she was mortified at what she was watching.  I think she was mortified when she realized it was me.  The diagram above is meant to show that they couldn\\'t really see my face until I stood up.  At least this is the logic I am convincing myself of.\\n\\nEDIT 3:  I\\'m being very specific that she is not my girlfriend and \"a girl I am dating\" because honestly I wouldn\\'t do something like this with my girlfriends friends.  I don\\'t think either of us see a future in this relationship, we\\'re just having fun.\\n\\nEDIT 4:  Yes, they were staring at my butthole.  I\\'m well groomed, no one seemed to mind. To be honest if,\\n\\nEDIT 5:\\n\\nSince everyone is asking, I\\'ll offer my thoughts.  No, I\\'m not gay or bi, and have never sucked someone elses dick before.  Pretty sure being gay or bi involves being attracted to and/or having sexual experiences with people of the same sex.  It\\'s my own dick, so I think that conversation is pretty straight forward.  By your logic, all of you have given thousands and thousands of handjobs and ew, you\\'ve touched a dick like 10 times today at least.\\n\\nAs for the \"I\\'ve heard it feels more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked\" - I bring it back to the above statement.  A handjob obviously doesn\\'t feel the same as jerking off.  Kissing your own hand feels different than someone else kissing your hand, etc. etc.  I think maybe the first time its unfamiliar to have your own dick in your mouth, or for those of you \"with a friend who told you\" .. they probably only tried it once or twice.  But it\\'s become a familiar feeling for me, and it feels wonderful.  Better than jerking off that\\'s for sure.\\n\\nAnd yes, I have and do occassionally do this instead of masturbating.\\n\\nThanks for coming to my TED talk. Happened earlier today. Still physically cringing. I was buying a few things at the Hardware store for work and a woman in front of me had some plants in her arms. They were crazy colors, like insanely vibrant shades of purple, orange, red, etc.\\n\\nWhen I got to the checkout stand she was at the one next to me still holding them in a crate box in her arms. I pointed at the plants and said “are those real?” \\n\\nThe look she gave me was pure taken-aback surprise and she said “excuse me?” And I was like “those flowers are super colorful, are they real?” And she was like “OH, yes they’re real” and moved the box to show me. When she moved the plants it was incredibly obvious she had doctored boobs. Like two softballs stuck on a wall. I instantly realized she thought I had asked if her tits were real, in line at the hardware store, without any prior conversation. I just kinda said nice I’ll have to check those out, finished my transaction and left. This shit never happens to me but I’m cringing hard at the look on her face when she said “excuse me?”\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: Lady at the store thought I was asking if her boobs were real when I pointed at the plants she was holding and said “are those real?”. My dad grew up with his family slamming him for not being his father\\'s biological son. The rumor was that grandma had an affair with a man named \"Tillery\" when she got pregnant with my father. My grandparents always denied it, but the rumors have always hung around my dad. Grandpa was a Native American man grandma was white, and dad was their only biological child (his siblings were adopted). My dad was blonde as a kid but got darker as he\\'s aged, and he looks like grandpa, so because we all believed 100% that he was biologically grandpa\\'s son, we decided to finally set his fears aside and prove it with a DNA kit for his 61st birthday. The kit came back today after nervously waiting several weeks, and there\\'s a lot of matched relatives, with the name \"Tillery\". No native American DNA results at all, no one with his fathers family\\'s name. He\\'s crushed and I feel awful. This has to be the worst thing I\\'ve ever done to my dad.\\n\\nTldr: I bought my dad a DNA kit to prove he wasn\\'t the result of an affair, and instead proved he was.\\n\\nUpdate: We talked about the whole thing, and he\\'s okay with the results. He was disappointed and needed to come to grips with it. He appriciates his dad even more now, and thinks he must have known all along. He is glad to have the information for health reasons, and to be able to look into some history in a way he couldn\\'t before. Yesterday I got onto a subway train around rush hour so it was quite packed. I squeeze in with my brother and find a spot to stand. I notice a little dude (about 6 or 7) in the seat next to where I\\'m standing squish up against his mother to make room for me. He looks up and smiles, his eyes inviting me to sit down next to him. As a larger human, 6\\'3\" almost 200 lbs, the tiny half a seat that he had opened up wouldn\\'t quite fit me.\\n\\nThough I couldn\\'t let his kindness go unnoticed so I decided to half-cheek it, to be sure he understood what he did was really nice. As I sat down I thanked him for making room and told him I really appreciated the gesture. We high-fived and in hindsight I should have ended it there.\\n\\nI noticed he had his backpack with him so I asked how school was that day. He told me it was just alright. Then I asked the fatal question, \"Do you have a lot of homework over the weekend?\" He let me, the stranger, know he had a big math packet that he had to get done. Unfortunately for him, his mother was listening to our conversation.\\n\\nHer eyes lit up when he told me about the packet. She yelled \"Oooo boy!! You told me you finished that yesterday! Guess who doesn\\'t get to play his video games this weekend?! You, ya little liar!!!\" His head sunk into his chest, as did mine right along with him. \\n\\nA few stops later his mom dragged him off the train by his little jacket. He looked back at me as they departed, a look that said \"bro, I thought we were cool, how could you do me like that???\" His look of betrayal is gonna haunt me for days. \\n\\nHang in there little buddy! One weekend may seem like an eternity at your age, but time flies! \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR- Sat down next to a little dude on the subway because he went out of his way to make room for me. Asked him about homework and now he cant play his video games for the whole weekend. Hello! So as a kid (and I promise this setup matters), I was raised in an Islamic household. Thing with being Islamic in America is there aren\\'t any good Muslim schools to send your child so they could learn both Faith and have a decent education. So my parents decided to send me to a Catholic school since it was closest to the values they wanted me to live by. At home, my grandmother would tell me stories from the Quoran. I loved those stories, but sometimes, my grandmother would stop her storytelling voice and use her fact voice. Like she was telling me something that happened at the store. She was using her fact voice when she was telling me about the story of how a father had to sacrifice his son to God but when he tried to bring down the knife, it wouldn\\'t hurt his son because God had willed that his dedication meant he no longer needed to sacrifice his son. So I asked my grandmother if I could become invincible to knives if I believed in God enough and she told me \"No don\\'t take the story literally. Take the meaning of the story.\" Aka do not stab yourself. So I was like oooooh all of these stories are *metaphorical.* The Bible at my school and the Quoran at home are both collections of stories filled with wisdom meant to be interpreted as the situation sees fit. Like a superhero story where Jesus and Muhammad are the main characters. They\\'re meant to help the story deliver me a meaning like Ash from Pokemon. I think you see where this is going, I thought they were stories. *They\\'re not real*. And I grew up thinking that. That these religions were a way of life, not to be taken literally.\\n\\nCut to driving with a friend from school through California to Palm Springs to see her grandmother. We were talking about how hot it was and I joked about how we needed a flood to cool us down. Where\\'s God\\'s wrath when you need, right? She laughed and started to draw the conversation to her admiration of Jesus. We started talking about miracles and hungry people and I said \"Man, I wish we could do those kind of miracles for real. The world could use a few.\" and she replied something along the lines of \"Well who knows? Jesus could be back soon\" and I chuckled. Did that thing where you blow air out of your nose and smile. I thought it was a joke. Like ha, ha Superman is gonna come fly us to her grandma\\'s house. And she looked at me and asked me why I laughed. I told her I thought she was being sarcastic. She corrected me that she was not. Then I asked her \"wait are you saying like.. Jesus could actually, really show up on Earth\"? She got upset and said yes. Then the rest of the car ride was quiet. So instead of thinking \"Jesus is real\". I thought \"wow my friend must be really gullible\".\\n\\nThen once I got home, I told my grandmother about it. I thought it be a funny story. Like telling someone that your friend thinks elves are real. But she looked at me and went \"OP, Muhammad is real. And so was Jesus. What are you talking about?\" For the next 10 mins we kept talking and I started to realize that oh my god, my grandmother thinks the stories are real. Does everyone think that the stories about water turning into wine, and walking on water, and touching sick people to heal them was *REAL???*\\n\\nLastly, I pulled my pastor aside at school. And I asked him straight up \"Is Jesus real?\" and of course he was confused and said yes and asked me if I thought Jesus wasn\\'t real. I told him what I had thought my whole life and he goes \"Yeah, everything in the Bible actually happened\". So I asked him why none of those miracles have happened now or at all recorded in history and he goes \"I don\\'t know, but the Lord does and we trust him\".\\n\\nSo now my friend doesn\\'t talk to me, school is weird now because all of these ridiculous, crazy stories about talking snakes, angels visiting people, and being BROUGHT. BACK. FROM. THE. DEAD. are all supposed to be taken literally. And asking questions about it isn\\'t ok either, apparently. So yep. That\\'s eye opening.\\n\\nTLDR: I thought the Bible and Quoran were metaphorical books and that everything in them wasn\\'t real but rather just anecdotal wisdom. Then I learned people actually thought things in the Bible and Quoran were real. Now everything is tense between me and my friends and family.\\n\\nEdit: So many comments! Wanted to say thank you for every respectful, well thought out theological opinion or suggestion. I can\\'t say thank you enough to everyone in the comments and all your different experiences with religion and spirituality are inspiration and ideas I will consider for a while. Even if I can\\'t reply to you in time, thank you. Genuinely, thank you. Edit: I don’t care who you vote for. Don’t be an asshole when the person some stranger voted for is none of your business. I don’t go around asking if random people voted for either, then throw a fit about it. People come from all walks of life, culture, creed, and political association. It’s none of my damn business what some person I’ll probably never meet again does with their vote. I have too much going on in my own life to worry about that, and I’m sure many of you do as well. \\n\\nEdit #2: Clerks have cameras. Forwarded with time stamps of my call during the time of this happening to ACLU and police. I don’t care if you believe this or not, just be safe and don’t be an asshole to those around you for stupid reasons like this. \\n\\n\\nI was not even at the Clerk’s office to vote, as I did so by mail awhile back. I went there to renew my auto registration, and bailed as soon as I saw the line descending into the staircase. Upon leaving, this guy pulls up in his giant white truck and asks if I voted for Trump. I say “fuck no, not here for that.” Bad move, i guess. He proceeds to drive next to me, screaming that I must “live in my mommy’s basement”, that he’s going to “get me”, “You’re a f*cking r*t*rd”, etc. while following me to my car and trying to cut me off (I’m walking down the road to get to the sidewalk that leads to the side parking area at this point. He waits for me to get into my car, and then several vehicles start following me until I pull up to the police station. I have a pretty recognizable car, so I put up the security/motion cameras that I bought months ago tonight just to be safe once this all blows over.\\n\\nThe world/country we (I) live in is sickening. Tell people it’s not their business or ignore them if they ask. It’s hard to trust this insanity.\\n\\nTL;DR :Told Trump supporter I didn’t vote for Trump, witnessed voter harassment for the first time. Disclaimer: this wasn\\'t actually today, but I just remembered it\\n\\nI was on my first date with a lovely girl name Michelle.  I took her to what people my age consider a pretty nice restaurant for a date.  She didn\\'t know where we were going ahead of time.  A few minutes after we ordered, her face turned bright red and she told me to hide.  I was confused and about to ask why when an older couple approached our table and introduced themselves as Michelle\\'s parents.  \\n\\nAfter some brief, uncomfortable small-talk, her father, who had already casually mentioned twice that he was a police officer, each time placing his hand where his gun holster would be, asked me a question I didn\\'t know people still asked.\\n\\n\"What are your intentions with my daughter?\"\\n\\nFor the record, my intentions were simply to get to know her and maybe start a relationship with her.  Unfortunately, the question caught me off-guard and I tend to (read: unfailingly) use humor as a defense mechanism.  So I replied:\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, officer.  I have Intention Deficit Disorder.\"\\n\\nMichelle and her mother both burst into laughter, but her father was not amused. He dragged my date away, never to be heard from (by me) again.\\n\\nTl;dr: date\\'s parents happen to be at the restaurant.  Father asks \"what are your intentions with my daughter?\"  I tell him I don\\'t know due to my \"Intention Deficit Disorder\".  He didn\\'t like it and dragged my date away. I (F, now 22) used to be acquainted with another girl my age (we were both about 17 at the time), it was a typical friend-of-a-friend situation. I am bisexual and thought she was really cute, but never once thought that she could possibly be into girls as well, least of all me.\\n\\nMy self esteem was extremely low around that age and I did all kinds of mental gymnastics to explain away all of her flirting. I once saw her at the grocery store and she became really shy and didn\\'t approach me (she was very shy in general) but later that day sent me a message saying something like \"I saw you at the grocery store today, you looked cute\". \\n\\nBut the absolute boldest move I completely ignored was Valentine\\'s day when we hung out as a group with our friends and she walked over to me and gifted me a hint so broad, I can\\'t explain how the wrapper didn\\'t burst: She had made me handmade heart-shaped chocolates and put them in a small transparent gift bag. There was only one other thing in the gift bag, the only thing in the universe that could be gayer than heart-shaped chocolate from one gal to another: a little paper card with some kind words on it and printed on the other side was a picture (a manga panel from the looks of it) of two girls holding hands.\\n\\nAnd my only thought was: \"Wow, what a nice girl! I have to be really careful not to develop a huge crush on her, since she couldn\\'t possibly be into me! She probably felt bad for me on Valentine\\'s day because I\\'m so single and unfortunate-looking. Those straight girls really lead you on without meaning to!\"\\n\\nToday I looked back on this situation with horrified realization, as Facebook told me she got married recently. To a woman.\\n\\nTL;DR: I thought a teenage friend had just been REALLY nice to me, realized she had been gay the whole time when she got married. This didn\\'t happen today but took place earlier this year shortly after my wife and I bought a new car. I was reminded about it today as my birthday is this month. Don\\'t worry, you\\'ll understand why that\\'s relevant soon enough.\\n\\nI came home from work and, like every other day, go to the restroom and browse Reddit while I\\'m taking care of my business. Most of you are probably doing just that right now....don\\'t judge me. I can\\'t remember what sub I was in, or even what the original post was about, but the comment section started to get pretty wild, as many of them do. Before I knew it I was reading about \"The Donkey Show.\" Yes that one. Some of the comments had links of what happens there or what can happen there. I wasn\\'t interested in seeing what that was all about, so I just kept reading.\\n\\nSomeone mentioned and linked another post talking about how The Donkey Show was similar to a specific genre of pornography. Midget porn. I thought, \"What the hell, I\\'ve never seen this sort of thing before.\" So I clicked.\\n\\nAs weird as it sounds, I clicked out of curiosity......I swear. What I saw was exactly what I expected to see. This specific video was of a man and a little person going at it. After a minute or so, I had seen enough and backed out of the post to continue browsing the sub I was in.\\n\\nI finished up in the restroom, took a shower, and got dressed to go out to eat. I get the kids in the car and wait for my wife to come out of the house.\\n\\nShe was taking a while, so I grabbed my phone and started messing around with it. My wife comes out and gets in the car. Immediately she says, \"What the hell is this?\" I put my phone down and looked at the dash she was pointing to. On the big screen, in the middle of the dash, of the new car we just bought, was something along the lines of \"blonde midget gets railed by big bl......www.pornhub.com\". I had never had a car with this feature before, so I was unaware that the last thing you played on your device would show up on a display like this. I knew I was screwed. It felt like an eternity to try and open my music app back up so I could change what was displayed on the screen.\\n\\nAfter about 5 minutes of explaining to her how easy it was to find yourself down a reddit rabbit hole, she finally understood but now thinks I have a thing for little people. Before we even left the garage, she was on the phone with my aunt telling her everything. All I could hear was roaring laughter from both sides of the conversation. Before the conversation was over, they had my next birthday party planned out. I\\'m pretty sure I\\'ll be having a few extra people show up for my birthday celebration this year. Yay me...\\n\\nShe said to me one day, \"I know you won\\'t leave me for another woman, but I\\'m afraid you\\'ll leave me for half of one.\"\\n\\nI doubt she will ever let this one go...\\n\\nTL;DR I went down a rabbit hole browsing reddit and ended up watching midget porn causing my wife to think it is a fetish of mine.\\n\\nEdit: Damn! I fell asleep for 6 hours and woke up to 3 golds, 2 silvers, and a poop, You guys are awesome! I\\'m glad you got a kick out of my mishap.\\n\\nEdit2: Just to clarify, my kids are too young to be able to read what was on the screen and while I was pleading my case, we kept it very G rated.\\n\\nEdit3: Removed the race of the man in the description so people stop getting triggered. So my dad has had this didgeridoo in the house since he visited his sister in Australia 10+ years ago. My parents wanted to go out for a walk but I decided I’d eaten too much cheese and couldn’t be arsed. While they were out the internet went down so I was sort of wandering around looking for something to do when I spotted the didg. I thought to myself in all these years I’ve never actually tried to play it (it’s more of a decoration and I barely take it in when I see it) and maybe it’s time. I pick it up and put it to my lips. I felt like I knew what I was doing and that it was similar to playing a trumpet and wanted to play a long, loud note. I take a sharp inhale and immediately feel something hit the back of my throat. I splutter really hard and a small white globular thing comes flying out and hits the floor. At first I thought it was saliva and ignored it as I had a weird sensation in my throat and mouth. It felt like tingling to start with but grew into more of a tickle on the inside of my cheeks and a bit on my gums. I glance down at the white stuff on the floor and see several baby spiders crawling out of it and in all directions. The second I clock what’s happened I feel something tickling my top lip and slap my mouth with my hand. I have a squished spider on my lip and instantly go into panic mode. I run into the bathroom and spit repeatedly into the sink to see crushed spider bodies and some severed legs, some of which are still attached to parts of the body and are trying to drag themselves away from the plug hole. I urge several times and then frantically swill my mouth out with water. I don’t think my mouth will ever feel normal again.\\n\\nTL;DR - thought I could play didgeridoo, inhaled a mouthful of spiders.\\n\\nEdit; woah gold! And front page! Ta! Glad you all like/hate my story Throwaway because I\\'m still embarrassed and I don\\'t want anyone to associate the stupidity with me.\\n\\nFor background, I usually make the bed in the mornings, but I didn\\'t yesterday morning because I was running late.\\n\\nI went to see my dad yesterday but my wife wasn\\'t feeling well so she stayed home. I got back at around 8:30 and couldn\\'t find her anywhere. I checked the bedroom, the living room, the kitchen, the bathroom, everywhere, and I just couldn\\'t find her. Her wallet was there so I figured she just went out for a walk, which is normal since we live in a big city that\\'s active into the night. I started getting worried at around 9:30 because she also wasn\\'t answering her phone. I called a few of her friends and asked if they\\'d seen her but none had. I called her parents and asked them if they knew where she was, which led to them freaking out because no one could find her. My father in law told me to track her phone, so I went into her apple account and it told me that her phone was in our apartment. I turn on the find my iPhone sound and start running through the apartment thinking I should call the cops.\\n\\nI hear the sound coming from our bedroom so I go in and start tearing the room up, when suddenly my wife pops up from the bed and asks me what the hell I\\'m doing. Turns out the small lump that I thought was just a pile of blankets since I didn\\'t make the bed that morning was actually my wife, who went to sleep early because she didn\\'t feel well. She sleeps with ear plugs in so she didn\\'t hear me in the apartment.\\n\\nI had to sheepishly call her entire family, own up to my stupidity, and apologize for terrifying them.\\n\\ntl;dr I didn\\'t make the bed yesterday morning and then I thought I was about to end up in an episode of SVU. This involves multiple FU’s and happened a year or so ago.\\n\\nI bought a present for my grandmother from a website for her birthday. All went well. She got the present and was delighted with it. A few months later I used the same website to order a vibrator but it never arrived. I called customer support to complain and they went over my order including making sure that they had the correct address. It was then that I realized that I had sent the vibrator to my grandmother as her address had been saved as the default one from the previous order. \\n\\nI called my grandmother to ask if she had received the package. She said yes she had but she gave it to my dad because she thought it was a toy for his cats that I had sent to her house by mistake. Now I don’t know if my grandmother honestly did not know that this was a vibrator and really thought it was a cat toy. I believe she really had no idea what it was. She grew up catholic in a small southern town and wasn’t exposed to much outside of her little world. \\n\\nSo now, not only had I sent a vibrator to my grandmother, she had given it to my dad. I refused to call my dad. I was not ready to have that conversation. But about a week later I got the package from my dad that contained the vibrator. We never spoke of it. \\n\\nYou would think this is the end of the story but it is not. Remember when I called customer service to find out why I didn’t get my package? They were very nice and sent out a replacement. Where did they send the replacement? TO MY GRANDMOTHER!!! I never told them to change the address. At this point I was just too embarrassed to ask anyone about it and tried to forget it ever happened. \\n\\nCut to Christmas. My dad came to visit. He told me he had something for me so I went to the guest room with him. He hands me the package with the vibrator and says “please, for the love of god, stop sending vibrators to your grandmother”.\\n\\nTL;DR sent a vibrator to my grandmother who gave it to my dad to give to me TWICE!!! I wish I was joking. This is gonna be descriptive and NSFW.\\n\\nWhen I was 17, I was rushed to the hospital and diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. During my stay I met my new doctor, and after we exchanged a few words and all that, he told me he had to put a finger in my butt to test something. It was extremely awkward but fine. After I got out the hospital I had to continue seeing this doctor frequently for checkups and he had to perform 2 colonoscopies on me. After that my condition got better & I only need to continue seeing him now for checkups.\\n\\nDuring the checkups over the years my family and him formed a bond. He\\'s a cool doctor and my parents really like him and were super thankful that he nursed me back to health, so my dad offered my doctor a service that he provides for work just as a thank you. That\\'s how both of our families eventually came together and shortly after, I started dating my doctor\\'s oldest son (he\\'s 23, I\\'m 22).\\n\\nThis was (and still is) completely fine. My family loves him and his family loves me, we\\'ve been together for almost 2 years now. So here\\'s where I fucked up.\\n\\nHe\\'s been staying back at his family\\'s house since quarantine started and we missed each other so I decided to go over (I\\'ve been quarantined as well) and hang out with them. He told me to come early so we could have some alone time (both parents are Healthcare workers) so I did. We were in his room and things were getting heated and I basically just flat out told him I wanted to try anal.\\n\\nHe was open to it but was hesitant because of my UC. He asked me if it was safe for us to do that and without thinking, my BIG ASS MOUTH said,\\n\\n\"I don\\'t know, I\\'d have to ask your dad. He\\'s the only one who\\'s been in my ass before.\"\\n\\nI can\\'t explain the look on his face but it goes without saying that that completely ruined the mood. I was laughing out of embarrassment and sorrow and I really just wanted to melt into the floor and disappear. I\\'m sure he already knew that his dad did that stuff to me because obviously I\\'m his patient but I\\'m also sure he\\'d pushed that thought way into the back of his mind and I drudged it up.\\n\\nDinner with the family was kind of awkward and before I left he tried to reassure me and tell me that it wasn\\'t as horrible as I thought and we could just forget about it but I don\\'t know how I\\'ll ever recover from that.\\n\\nAnd no, before anyone asks, I\\'m not going to ask his dad if it\\'s safe for me to try anal with his son.\\n\\nTL;DR: I told my boyfriend that his dad (My doctor) had been in my ass before (Because of procedures) right before sex.\\n\\nedit: holy shit i went to sleep and woke up and this is at 25k?? i don\\'t really know what to say but thank yall for living through this nightmare with me i guess and thanks to the people w/ uc/chrons (AND doctors!!) who actually gave me advice on having anal LMAO\\n\\nedit2 (regarding uc/chrons) : for those asking because I can\\'t get to everyone, I had alot of other procedures done too, even a pill cam which I didnt know existed until I had it, but the one thing that finally worked for me was Mercaptopurine (6MP). I think I got lucky and it worked wonders for me and basically gets rid of all my symptoms, even though I still sometimes have those horrible stomach aches. good luck to everyone who\\'s still struggling with it I\\'m never living this down. It\\'s pretty standard for a lot of other sex-related posts here, but it\\'s really destroyed me on an emotional and spiritual level. Obligatory \\'this wasn\\'t actually today but last week and I\\'ve just been thinking about it every day since\\'.\\n\\nThe first thing you should know is that I am NOT a sexual person. I barely ever have \\'urges\\', I rarely think about anything like that, my libido is comparable to that of a fence posts\\'...etc. However, I started noticing that I was becoming increasingly bitter towards things like that, so I decided, \\'You know what, I\\'m going to try and explore that side of me, maybe bring it out a little more!\\' and so, I did... it. I bought two sex toys (nothing extravagant, just basic, cheap little items) and a bottle of lubricant because I work smart, not hard.\\n\\nThings SHOULD be fine, I think to myself, I\\'ll order them and they\\'ll come in in a week or so, no one\\'s expecting any packages then, so there will be no issues and they\\'ll hand it right off to me, none the wiser!\\n\\nAnd then that DIDN\\'T happen, can you believe it?\\n\\nNo, what actually happened was worse, and proved to me that my dad is a monstrous, monstrous man who lives to cause me pain. Unbeknownst to me, I was still under my trial of Amazon Prime (I\\'d forgotten to cancel it after buying a Vulpix plush, sue me), and the package shipped and arrived... The next day. Even this should have been fine, no one in my family opens packages that aren\\'t theirs except one little thing: MY package came in with my MOMS\\' packages.\\n\\nI didn\\'t realize they were coming in that day, so I was still curled up in bed watching TV. When I heard the delivery truck pull up, I thought, \\'oh cool\\' and then went back to my show. It just so happened that my mom ordered a lot of different parts for her car, and then she assumed the box was one of hers as well without checking the label since I hadn\\'t mentioned ordering anything to her (obviously).\\n\\nAccording to my mom, she opened it, thought, \\'oh, \\\\*my dad\\\\* must have bought something.\\' and then... she checked the label. And saw my name.\\n\\nDid she do the respectable thing and tape it back up with clear tape like nothing happened? Did she just hand it to me and walk away silently? No, she went to my dad. Because of course she did. According to my mom, she walked in, said, \\'our daughter ordered sex toys and I don\\'t know how to handle it\\' and my dad shot up in bed with horror. A moment later, he giggled and jumped out of bed, taking the box from her and saying, \\'I want to give it to her!\\'\\n\\nHe walks into my room. I say hey to him and sit up to look at him. He tilts the box towards me to show it\\'s contents, and then we stare at each other in silence for several seconds before he sets it down next to me with the biggest grin on his face, and then calmly walks off.\\n\\nI can\\'t look my parents in the face anymore. I might actually have to move out, COVID be damned because my dad won\\'t stop making masturbation jokes.\\n\\nTL;DRI ordered two sex toys and lube off Amazon without realizing I had Prime, which meant that I didn\\'t grab my package when it was delivered. My mom opened it, thinking it was hers, and then went to my dad for help. My dad is a monster, so he came into my room and stared at me while showing me the contents of the box, then set it down next to me and walked out. I think I\\'m getting an apartment soon.\\n\\nEdit: I\\'ve seen some comments about my dad being gross or weird for this, my mother is equally as weird, and a fair share of incest comments. I want to assure you all that this is pretty normal in my family dynamic, my parents are VERY sex-positive to the point it\\'s an ongoing joke in our house. They encourage us to explore our sexualities and are just GREAT parents. My mom panicked and went to my dad, her best friend, and as horrified as my dad was, he saw the chance to tease me relentlessly and he did what any great father would do and took. That. Chance.\\n\\nAnd to the incredibly odd incest comments: Your kink, not my kink. Also, I\\'m a lesbian and my dad is pretty much exclusively into hot moms, so. Ya know. Obligatory this happened over 5 years ago. I just saw a comment that reminded me of what happened so here we go.\\n\\nI used to play an MMO with a bunch of people I knew IRL. Out of all of them, I was the most interested in PvP but sucked at it. One day a new guy shows up. He used to play, but stopped for a few years. Everyone starts talking about how he was basically a legend, a god at 1v1s, was one of the former top players in the game, was so inhumanly good he got mistaken for a bot, etc.\\n\\nI immediately developed an awkward crush on him. He heard I was into PvP and challenged me to a 1v1 where he promptly kicked my ass. Then he spent a lot of time condescendingly giving me tips on how to improve and said he would show me the ropes. Being a dork with a crush, I was so grateful for any attention he gave me.\\n\\nHis idea of teaching me was basically beating me over and over again. After a few days of this, he got bored and stopped paying attention to me. I was embarrassed that I was so bad and kept losing, so I though if I could impress him, he would spend time in game with me again. I spent a stupid amount of time practicing on the side and researching. I\\'m talking like 6 hours on weekdays and 10+ on weekends. I literally lost weight because I stopped snacking on the side and ate the minimum amount at meal times.\\n\\nSo after like 10 months of nonstop playing, I improved a stupid crazy amount. Managed to jokingly convince him to duel and I beat him. He thought it was a fluke and demanded a rematch. So we played again and I beat him again. He got so mad he changed his build to exactly counter mine, and he beat me. I was so happy because I thought he was into it, so I changed my build to counter his and beat him. And it turned into this stupid back and forth.\\n\\nI was having the time of my life. I thought I was showing off my improvement to a guy I liked. I learned theory-crafting, I learned how to play properly, etc etc. Meanwhile he was fucking raging his head off on his side of the screen. After a lot of back and forth killing each other in turns, he finally says he\\'s done and logs off. I had no idea what happened and figured real life things was going on.\\n\\nAnyways, he didn\\'t log back on for a while and I heard from our mutual friend that he quit the game. He claimed he only came back temporarily from a break and needed to focus on real life job stuff or something.\\n\\nI did not connect that with beating him. I just thought the timing was bad and I was sad I wouldn\\'t be able to see him around anymore. He never logged back on again. A few months later we had another IRL hangout and he basically ignored me. Then made a few pointed comments about how he didn\\'t like girls who were as into gaming as he was. And that girls who liked games too much were basically guys and he wasn\\'t into guys. And that\\'s when I finally realized he was mad I beat him.\\n\\nAnd he literally never returned to play again. And after a few more years, I quit gaming. And funnily enough, I heard from our mutual friend again that that\\'s when he decided to start playing again.\\n\\nTL;DR I got good at a game to impress a guy I liked, beat him, and turns out he didn\\'t like girls who were into gaming and also quit the game.\\n\\nEdit: Fuck I wrote this on a whim before going to sleep. To clarify, he wasn\\'t actually that good. It\\'s like how everyone knows that one guy who\\'s super good at Smash, but then goes to a local tournament and gets wrecked by actual pros. He was the best out of our little circle of friends, but wasn\\'t actually top tier in the game. And at the end of that day, I wasn\\'t even considered close to top tier either.\\n\\nAlso dug up my old reddit account because I knew a bunch of people were going to call me fake. Feel free to peruse my post history to confirm my level of obsession. It\\'s a bit sad, I definitely had an unhealthy interest/addiction. I ended up quitting cold turkey and haven\\'t logged back on in years. Sorry to all my old teammates, I literally left them with a \"see you next time\" and vanished off the face of the planet.\\n\\nEdit2: I didn\\'t quit the game because of him. I played for several more years after and got back into PvP and shot up the ranks because I went from a keyboard turning skill-clicker into someone who could actually play. Did weekly tournaments for a bit, got good enough to see the occasional pro players in my queue and formed a little team with other people around my level. The game itself went through a ton of bad balance patches and a ton of people left. I ultimately left because the gamemode was \"dying\" and I realized it was making me depressed and more angry and toxic the more I played. **TLDR; Company uses Google accounts that are all connected. I fucked up and abused a policy that turns out results in a complete ban/block on the Google account, and ALL associated accounts. Everyone in my company is now blocked by Google and some of their personal e-mails are also blocked as well. Google isn\\'t helping us out since their policy is final and will not share any information regarding the problem, but we hope to get in contact with someone who can fix this for us.**\\n\\nPreface, this happened on Friday and is still on-going. I\\'ve tried to keep things as detailed as possible but vague enough so I won\\'t be outed since I guarantee someone will read this eventually. I still do not know if I am the culprit, but I am 90% sure that I am. I feel like this is a fireable offence and I will step up and take it if it comes to that. I\\'m also posting on a throwaway account for obvious reasons.\\n\\nI work at a pretty sizeable software company, with roughly 100-150 employees. We migrated to Gmail and other Google services about 2 years ago and have been relying on them and the e-mail system to do our job. It\\'s safe to say that everyone is using Gmail or Google in one way or another. Now, our Gmail accounts are set up to our company, so everyone is connected. Keep this in mind, as it will be relevant later.\\n\\nI have a friend who creates Android apps on the side. I do something similar to this, but instead my apps revolve around cloning .apk files and restoring them, similar to a service called Titanium Backup. \\n\\nAs a joke, every time my friend releases an app (usually paid), I buy the app and clone it with my software, and then refund it. After that, I send him an e-mail with the cloned version through Gmail with something along the lines of: \"Look at this cool app I found on the store, it was completely free! Try it out!\", or stupid shit like that. It was a bit of a stupid inside joke that kind of stuck for a while and was only between us.\\n\\nRecently he uploaded a new app and I did the same thing as usual. I was actually on the toilet at work at about 10am or so and was doing my business in the stall on my phone. I was on my work account and bought the app and refunded and all that jazz. I e-mailed it to him and then finished up in the bathroom and went back to work.\\n\\nAbout an hour later before lunch, everyone was talking to each other about problems accessing their Google accounts. At the time, it didn\\'t click with me what had happened.\\n\\nOne of my colleagues requested help and I went to check it out. It turns out that their account was blocked by Google due to ToS violations. Their Google Payments account was blocked as well. I thought this was insane and wondered if it happened to me and everyone else in the building, and surely enough it did. We got banned by Google, all of us. \\n\\nThe afternoon was pandemonium. We were all freaking out, our IT guys were trying to get a hold of Google but couldn\\'t get in touch with anyone. We could sign into our accounts but not do anything with them. All our work was shared with Google services.\\n\\nEventually someone realized that their non-work accounts were banned as well. It wasn\\'t until yesterday that someone made the connection. Anyone who had their accounts as a recovery option were also caught in the ban wave. One of the girls at work was fucking bawling her eyes out since she couldn\\'t access her e-mail either.\\n\\nAnyways, we were all told to go home on Friday. I went home and looked this up myself, and I found out that this ban (sometimes on the entire account but always on the Google Payments account) happens when someone abuses their refund policy. It bans all the accounts associated with it, and remember how I said all our work accounts were connected?\\n\\nYeah...\\n\\nSo it\\'s been two days now and we\\'ve been chatting over Skype, no one knows what happened and the IT guys are fucking livid along with our supervisor and boss who are pissed that Google isn\\'t helping us out. Their policy is to not share any information about what caused this and they will not reverse these actions. The posts I\\'ve found online relating to this have had similar problems (not to this extent of course), but no one has been able to solve this type of policy breach since Google does not help them, even if it was by accident or due to some other cause...\\n\\nSo yeah, that\\'s that. I\\'m 99% sure that I am the culprit who caused this. I do not know why Google has a scorched-earth policy when it comes to this kind of stuff, but I fucked up and our boss is looking to migrate away from Google even though we just recently signed on not too long ago. I might make an update next week once this is, if at all, resolved.\\n\\n**EDIT1:** This blew up pretty quickly. Luckily, I have 3 PMs from people close to, or reps who can help me out. If I missed anyone else, thanks for reaching out. I am in touch with one of them now and I am getting in touch with IT at our office and will have to first explain this and figure out what to do next. I will likely not update until tomorrow or later on depending on how this pans out.  This did, essentially, happen today.  \\n\\nA couple weeks ago my 5 year old daughter found a black widow mom and her egg sack.  She wanted to look at it, so I very carefully scooped it up into a jar, twisted on the top and went around it with duct tape for good measure.  She begged to let them hatch so she could watch them, and this seemed to be decent science homeschooling, after which point I planned to put them in the freezer for a somewhat humane death.  What’s the harm, I thought?  They are sealed up well.  \\n\\nWell guess what, they weren’t.  The jar I used was plastic and something some toys had come in.  There were small HOLES in the bottom and sides, barely visible.  Smaller than a hole punch, but plenty big for a baby black widow.\\n\\nSo today we’re going about our lives, when she notices a tiny spider.  I kill it.   Then there’s another.  Then another.  I start to think....oh no.  I grab the jar to find the egg sack has indeed hatched, with hundreds of tiny little venom weapons.  But I see with the relief the duct tape is still there, there’s no way they could have gotten out.  Til I look at my hand.  IN THE MOMENT I WAS HOLDING THE JAR ONE CRAWLED ON TO MY HAND.  At which point I noticed the holes.  I screamed, said some words that definitely shouldn’t be said in front of a 5 year old, and wanted to fling away the jar but managed to hold on to it in fear that tossing it would further distribute its murderous contents.  \\n\\n\\nNow my child is playing outside while I furiously vacuum and clean and wash every surface.\\n  G-d have mercy.\\n\\nTL;DR Thought I was showing my child some cool nature in action, ended up with nature all over my bedroom, where nature means hundreds of baby black widows.\\n\\nEdit:  here are pictures of the ones that didn’t escape https://imgur.com/gallery/sF1PERS\\n\\nAnd my daughter’s rendition of them:  https://imgur.com/gallery/2fJCmq3\\n\\nFurther edits:\\n\\nThank you so much to the kind people who Venmoed me money for the exterminator who am I now definitely going to get to come tomorrow!  (I’m actually going to return the funds because I was able to get it worked out, but thank you SO much!)\\n\\nPeople asking how I could be that stupid...I dunno, frazzled homeschooling single mom corona exhaustion and just poor judgment, I guess?  We’ve raised lots of other insects in jars with no escapees, so I guess I got a little overconfident about the status of jar impenetrability.  Yep.  I FUed.\\n\\n\\nEven Further edit: \\n\\nWhile most people are upset that I didn’t immediately KILL IT WITH FIRE and I stupidly brought it inside, enough people are upset about my inhumane treatment of the spiders that I wanted to comment on it.  They were originally on the porch, not far out in nature, and given how dangerous they were, I felt I was making a choice between killing them then and there or later.  I don’t normally have the ability to drop what I’m doing in a day a drive out to the middle of no where, far away from other humans, to release dangerous spiders.  The observation option, if I had done it correctly, seemed like it would at least offer the opportunity to see them hatch, which does make a pretty educational impact on young kids, I think, more than another YouTube video.  I do not torture animals for fun, I’m a vegetarian and hold that life is sacred.  Besides mosquitos and dangerous insects I don’t kill things.   I get why compassionate people were upset by this.  \\n\\nThe spiders are still alive, not frozen, and now, since she’s Reddit internet famous, today I WILL drive to the middle of nowhere and release the mom spider to go about her spider life far away from people.  If anyone wants to suggest a name for her, go for it, and she will live in hated/beloved infamy.\\n\\nIn the true spirit of the internet, I’m sure this will manage to displease everyone, the people who are upset I did this in the first place and will exterminate the inside ones now, and the substantial number of people who want me to KILL IT WITH FIRE  and will think it’s crazy to release the mom ;-). Sorry bout that!  I’ll post a picture of the release later, if I get a chance, and everyone can sleep with their preference of more soundly / less soundly for knowing she survived. My PC sits next to my Stepdad\\'s laptop in the living room. My cat likes to jump on the keyboard or the laptop and lay on it. A moment ago, he jumped up onto the keys and the screen lit up showing me to opened photo gallery. I went over and was going to close the application and then shut down the laptop. I was greeted with three distinct photos.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOne- My mother and my stepdad in a threesome. The thing is, the person in the middle was my mother\\'s best friend. I saw her eating out my own mother as my Stepdad drilled the other girl.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTwo- My mother sucking off my stepdad, In my dad\\'s house. On the counter. Where I eat.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThree- More tame, but my stepdad (who is bald) with a decent head of hair. I\\'ve never seen him with more than a little fuzz before.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo I have to face them tomorrow with these images seared into my mind.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR - Saw my mom\\'s porn. Help me God.\\n\\nEdit: My mother woke me up while I was operating on three hours of sleep and ho boy. My stepdad uses reddit. He found this. You fuckers brought me to the front page. This is my first time ever here and my lord, why this post? Thanks anyway, even though my life just got a lot worse, now I have 10k virtual clicks!\\n\\nEdit 2: Not 30 seconds after posting this edit my mom said she looked at the computer and couldn\\'t find these images, and then I got my first ever medal in this gold. Fuck the Internet Man :) I\\'m a grad student teaching freshmen English courses at a conservative Christian university.\\n\\nAt the end of the semester, my students have to present a slideshow proposing a change they think would make the world better.\\n\\nOne of my students, Steven\\\\*, asked if he could make his slideshow about safe-sex education being made mandatory in all public high schools.\\n\\nMe, not even sure if I was ALLOWED to approve a topic in favor of rampant and unchecked fornication among the youths of America, eventually told him to go for it, warning him that he\\'d have to be very careful about what he put in his slideshow, considering his topic.\\n\\nThe day of Steven\\'s presentation arrives. He marches to the front, and begins his slideshow, entitled \"The Case for Contraceptives.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s fuckin great. He tells a story about bees, who, if they want to get some sweet, sweet nectar from flowers without spreading any of their \"pollen\" around, need to learn to wear little \"booties\" on their \"feet.\"\\n\\nI laughed through the whole thing and then turned to the class to discuss the presentation\\'s effectiveness. But several students had blank expressions.\\n\\nFinally, one of the students, Goober\\\\* (this student and his nickname is pure gold, but that\\'s another story), raised his hand and said, \"Miz Holt\\\\*, whut\\'s a...cont-ruh-ceptive?\"\\n\\nI started to smile but stopped as I realized he was serious. I paused and and remembered my life before college, shuttled in a bubble between homeschooling and church and youth group.\\n\\nWe had a brief discussion about contraceptives then and there.\\n\\nThe next day, my classroom behavior under review, I was warned I was under unofficial probation (everyone at this university signs up as an \"at-will employee,\" meaning we can be fired at any time for any reason).\\n\\n\\\\*Names changed to protect the guilty\\n\\nTL;DR - I nearly lose my job at a conservative Christian university after explaining what contraceptives are to a few of my confused students.\\n\\n**Edit:** Many people are asking why I choose to work at such an institution. I\\'ll ask myself the same question until I graduate and leave. But in the meantime, I love my students, and I\\'ll keep trying to crack open their brains like my homeschooled Christian brain was cracked open when I first went to college.\\n\\nAlso, several people have messaged me asking me if I go to their school, and they\\'ve named SO MANY different schools. Ugh. This is America. My family is stacked like pancakes during the quarantine. My parents are still into each other, and I’m grateful. Although I’d pass on seeing the ass pats and octopus entanglements I’ve witnessed. My parents have been taking “full advantage” of the quality/quantity time, blasting music on the reg as if we can’t do the mental calculus about what’s going on behind closed doors.\\n\\nLast night, I was cooking with mom as we listened to one of my playlists that we share on Spotify as she was telling me how sorry she was that my college life is on hold. We’ve had the mother-daughter talk about sex but mostly abide the “don’t ask don’t tell” policy. As she was blathering on about how special our lock-down time is, I jokingly told her that my siblings and I all know how much she and my dad are enjoying quarantine. She blushed, laughed it off, and I thought that was the end…until this morning when I wake up, perplexed and confused, as she detonates my own MY PLAYLIST against me, played at decibel level to blister ears.\\n\\nShe’s the type to double down on a bad joke, so before she could completely ruin songs for me,I quickly replaced them with the worst kid\\'s music I could find. I laughed my ass off when the super-annoying and cringingly appropriate “Bouncy Ball\" from Dora the Explorer echoed through my house.\\n\\nMy victory was short-lived because I’ve spent the last two hours trying to take a college final while Barry White and Marvin Gaye serenade me through the drywall.\\n\\nTL:DR Teased my mom about having sex. Now, getting clowned as she gets the last laugh.\\n\\nEDIT: Her reign of terror continues. She\\'s changed all of the names to my playlists. Some of them include: \"Sexify my soul\", \"Your dad has big feet\" and \"Too hard to get out of bed\"... God, help me.\\n\\nEDIT2: You people are amazing. Thanks for making my day! My BF is on the way over for dinner and who knows what shit is about to go down with my bad ass mom when he gets here. Be safe eveeyone and keep on laughing. It was a four player family game of Monopoly. My brother, our parents and I were playing, and I wasn\\'t doing well. I wasn\\'t bankrupt or heavily mortgaged yet, but I could tell that if something drastic didn\\'t change in the next 3 turns or so, I was toast. I didn\\'t have any monopolies, but I did have a couple 2 out of 3 properties (New York and St. James being the standouts) and a couple scattered here or there. My brother was the clear favorite at this point, with my Dad in clear second. My Mom was losing right along with me.\\n\\n\\nIt was my turn, and I was trying to arrange a favorable trade.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m negotiating with my Dad. I have a property that\\'ll give him another monopoly, he has a card that\\'ll give me a monopoly. We both have enough money and side properties to even things up afterward. With a good trade here, we\\'d both have a higher chance of winning, significantly cutting into on my brother\\'s lead. Seems like it should be a slam dunk, right?\\n\\n\\nBut no, my Dad is pushing for the most ridiculous trades possible, and outright refusing to trade away those properties that are most valuable to me. If I don\\'t get a monopoly out of this, I might as well not even bother with a trade.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m getting frustrated as the negotiating stalls. But I get an idea. A terrible, terrible idea.\\n\\n\\nI say to my Dad: \"Dad, I\\'m clearly in the weaker position, here. But right now, that just means I have less to lose. So here\\'s the deal. If I don\\'t get a trade from you that gives me a monopoly, I\\'m going to sell all of my properties to [brother\\'s name] for $1.\"\\n\\n\\nDad didn\\'t like that at all, and there was no trade. He also probably didn\\'t expect me to carry through, but immediately after, I sold all my deeds to my brother for a dollar, and my Dad lost any chance whatsoever of winning the game.\\n\\n\\nDad isn\\'t speaking to me right now.\\n\\n\\nWas that a supremely dickish move to play? Yup. I\\'m feeling a little vindicated, though, for not letting myself be pushed around when I was the little guy.\\n\\n\\nBut will anyone ever want to play Monopoly with me again? I kinda doubt it.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR was losing at family Monopoly, went MAD and made Dad mad, family board games won\\'t ever be the same.\\n\\nEdit: Nothing\\'s deleted.  That is, I never tried to delete anything, but I\\'m getting messages that it\\'s deleted.  What\\'s going on?\\n\\nEdit 2: Automod had removed it, but the mod undeleted it after I messaged them.  Thank you mod!  Also, did I just win the internet?  What? This just happened last week. I got home from working out of town Thursday night and my wife warns me that there is a problem with my 7 year old daughter. “Beth” comes in and I can see that she has a few bug bites on her face and and one of her eyelids is a little droopy. She feels fine though. \\n\\nI am off work the next day and my wife is going to the office. I wake Beth up for breakfast and her eye is now much worse. It is more than half closed and a little red. She still feels fine. As soon as the doctor opens, I call them and they tell us to come in.  \\n\\nWe get there and I go to check in. The receptionist that I have never seen looks at my daughter and says “Oh. My goodness, what happened?”  So I respond as a joke “Eh, she got out of line”.   \\n\\nI know!  It’s horrible. I’m sorry!  I have a weird sense of humor and I’m a bit socially awkward.  Anyway, we all smile and giggle before we head to the waiting area.  Soon we are called in. The checkup goes as expected. It’s a reaction to the bug bites and he tells me to use some over the counter Zyrtec or Benadryl.  Then there is a knock on the door and the doctor steps out. \\n\\nHe comes back in a few minutes later and says that the police would like to talk to me. The doctor is angry. We all head to the Doctor’s office to talk.  \\n\\nThere is a policeman and a policewoman. The policewoman starts making small talk with my daughter and asks if she wants to go in the other room and read a book. My daughter has an irrational fear of the police from when her older brother would threaten to call them whenever she went in his room.  So she says no and buries her face in my side.  The police then tell me that it is better that she is in another room. I saw one of Beth’s cheer coaches bring her son in soon after we got there and mention that she may still be there to watch her. The doctor, still visibly angry goes to check and she is so Beth goes to sit with her in the waiting room. \\n\\nThe police explain that they have a report of possible child abuse. The Doctor explains that this was a simple misunderstanding. He just examined my daughter and there is no abuse.  I now realize that it is the receptionist that he is angry with.  She makes an excuse and leaves the room. He says that he thinks he has to let her go. He says this is the second incident in 2 weeks. He says that her bad judgement got his practice and the entire executive park closed for 4 hours last week and his neighbors now hate him. \\n\\nThe police are apologetic but say they need to do a full investigation and ask if I can come to the station.  A friend comes to pick up my daughter who is freaking out at this point. \\n\\nWe get to the station (they allow me to drive there myself) and my Uncle who is a lawyer meets me there.   The police are apologetic and say they already know what happened but a full investigation and report need to be done. They say it is a minimum of 3-5 days, maybe longer.  I call my wife who goes ballistic.  \\n\\nThe county attorney says that they normally seek restraining orders in these cases, but if I sign an agreement to stay away from my daughter until the investigation is closed they would not seek one. My uncle recommends this as the restraining order would be public record. I stay at my brothers for the weekend and schedule an out of town trip that I really don’t need to make for this week.  I can’t wait to get home to see my family and sleep in my own bed but I’m pretty sure my wife will have me on the couch for a little while.  \\n\\ntl/dr:  Made a bad joke, got investigated for hitting my kid, lost the right to see her. Sitting in a hotel room on a useless business trip.  \\n\\nEdit: Spelling\\n\\nEdit 2:  Update\\nThank you for the gold kind strangers.\\nWow this blew up.  I wanted to answer some of the questions that you guys had.  I want to thank all of you guys for the kind words and support.  For those of you saying that I am an idiot, you are probably right.\\n\\n1) I will not be sleeping on the couch.  My wife got over this fairly quickly and is no longer angry.  At least not at me.\\n\\n2) I am heading home from Boston tomorrow evening and I think everything should be resolved by then.\\n\\n3) I will not be taking legal action against the receptionist.  She was very young did not do this out of animosity. I do not know what if anything will happen to her job. I am not pushing for her to lose it.  \\n\\n4) The other story about the receptionist goes like this (as told to me by the doctor).  A few weeks ago the lights in the parking lot of the executive park blew and the landlord had trouble getting them fixed so he rented temporary light stanchions for the businesses that are open past sundown until they could figure out the problem.  These lights apparently ran on gas or diesel.  The receptionist came back from lunch one day and smelled something so she called the state\\'s department of environmental protection to say that she believed that there was a fuel leak.   The DEP closed the parking lot for the rest of the day for \"clean up\".  It turned out to be nothing. I go to this “mommy and me” thing every week with my daughter. Not because it’s my kind of thing, but because my mother-in-law paid the membership for a year as “a Christmas gift” to my one-year-old (AKA she doesn’t think I am socializing her grandchild enough and this was her way of passive-aggressively correcting my parenting).\\n\\nAnyways, we go to this thing every week for an hour and all the Pinterest moms are planning themed birthday parties and discussing screen time and sharing gluten free recipes while their kids stare at each other. But all these kids know sign language, and I thought that was pretty damn cool. So I start looking into this and try teaching my kid some basic signs for basic needs, and it’s working! Suddenly, my tiny human who otherwise could not effectively communicate with me knows how to say “more” and “all done” and “drink”! She can call me mom and my husband, dad! Holy shit! Thanks Pinterest moms! I take back all the shit I talked about you to my kid on our weekly drives home. \\n\\nWell today with my husband out of town, I didn’t feel much like cooking and since my daughter is pretty laid back at restaurants I decided to go out for a quick dinner. The kid loves French fries and so do I. So we hit the local burger joint and I order a beer, a burger with fries, and a side of fruit. The server brings a little styrofoam cup with a lid and a straw filled with water for my daughter, and I set it out of her reach so she doesn’t hulk smash the styrofoam and make a mess. So of course every time she wants some, she signs “drink”. And every time she wants my attention, she signs “dad” because apparently the slightly different sign for “mom” isn’t as fun for her. Ok, whatever. \\n\\nWell I notice a couple tables away, there are a couple of women who are also signing to each other but they’re looking over at us and snickering. I’m like okay, I did like 4 quick google searches, maybe I botched some of what I taught her. It’s fine. But then as the women are leaving, they stop by our table and one of them lays her iPhone down with a message typed out for me to read. It says something to the effect of “she’s calling you ‘dumb’ and telling you she wants to drink alcohol”. \\n\\nI’m like... wait... what? So she continues to show me that I have in fact taught my daughter the wrong signs, that there are different signs for “drink (non-alcoholic beverage)” and “drink alcohol” and by balling her first up instead of using a flat hand at her forehead, my daughter has been calling me dumb instead of dad which was already wrong obviously since I am her mom. I can only imagine what the Pinterest moms would’ve done had I shown up next week with my kid asking to drink liquor. \\n\\nTL;DR ASL is hard, and my baby has been asking me for alcohol all week due to improper signing\\n\\nETA: Thanks, everyone! I’m glad you all enjoyed this post. Please understand that the conversation that took place with the deaf women was totally lighthearted, they were not correcting our signing to be rude or in thinking that I was trying to teach my child proper ASL. They were not oblivious to the fact that baby signing is not the same as ASL. They just thought my baby was cute and used the coincidence to strike up conversation, and it was funny and welcome!\\n\\nAlso please note that I literally searched “baby sign language” and based the signs off of still frames from google. I have no idea how close they were to the real signs. Additionally, this happened 4 years ago when my now 5 year old was 12 months old. She speaks English well, for all of you who were concerned for her development. We were always sure to say the words while signing them. She now has a baby sister who is 12 months old and is signing which is what reminded me of this story that I decided to share with you all. I’m new to reddit and did not realize it was obligatory to let you know that this did not actually happen “today”. You can take back your upvotes for this as necessary :) We are in the middle of the Polar Vortex. I got a phone call last night saying that I didn\\'t have to come in to work the next day, which is awesome because my boyfriend also has the day off.\\n\\nWe decided to get a little tipsy, play some video games, and enjoy being indoors. Well, once we got liquored up we decided that it was sexy time and we went to the bedroom, where we had the lights partially dimmed. I was ready to get laid, because, well, I wanted to. So I told my boyfriend to grab the lube while I climbed on top of him.\\n\\nThe bottle of lube has one of those tops that you push down on one end, and the other end pops up so you can dispense it [like this](https://i.imgur.com/llIJq5V.jpg). I was on top of him, and this is where our drunk-asses fucked up.\\n\\nBecause he was holding the bottle of lube it\\'s right way up, all the liquid was towards the bottom and no where near the lid. He squeezed the bottle hard to try and get the liquid out, but since he didn\\'t turn it sideways, it didn\\'t work. Again, we were drunk, so shit happens.\\n\\nWhile he was squeezing the hell out of the bottle, he had it held directly to my labia/clit for the product to come out right where we needed it. He couldn\\'t get any lube to come out, so when he released the bottle, my labia and part of my clit got sucked into the cap, enough for the suction to be strong enough that it held onto my labia as I screamed and jumped off him.  The bottle dangled for less than a second until he grabbed the bottle and pulled it off my skin.\\n\\nI now have a small, hickey like bruise on my labia, and the plastic caused my clit to bleed a little bit. We sobered up real quick, I fell asleep crying with my boyfriend rubbing my back.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR Boyfriend got too close using the lube, clit got vacuumed into the 7th gate of hell. I asked my girlfriend the other day, \"Why do the doors of the bathroom stalls have space on the bottom?\"\\n\\nShe told me they\\'re like that so we can easily see if the stall is occupied or not in a \"duh\\\\~\" tone.\\n\\nI followed up by saying, \"But sometimes, people can see my butt.\"\\n\\nShe started laughing her butt off and asking why/how.\\n\\nSo I had to explain why my butt was so low to the ground; I wipe my butt after pooping by taking a step forward off the toilet and squatting really low.\\n\\nI then argued with her that my wiping method is normal until she showed me a link to [http://www.howtowipeyourbutt.com/](http://www.howtowipeyourbutt.com/) and I was shocked.\\n\\nWe were both curious where/how I even learned that from.\\n\\nWas it a potty training error? Apparently not. We asked my parents, sibling, grandparents, cousins, aunts, & uncles if they wipe their butt by squatting, too, but no one does that except for me.\\n\\nSo, I\\'ve been wiping my butt and mooning hundreds of people in bathroom stalls for 20 years of my life.\\n\\n\\\\#dead\\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\nFor 20 years, I squatted all the way to the ground after pooping in order to wipe my butt. So I\\'m a bit of a soccer fan, and today two big local teams had a game, so naturally I was watching the match on my living room little did I know there was another match going on my neighbours house. About ten minutes into my game, I started hearing screams coming from the house across the street.\\n\\nBetween the game and the distance between us I really couldn\\'t distinguish any words, so I just raised the volume of my TV and kept watching. During half time I got a bit hungry and decided to make myself some popcorns, for those of you who don\\'t watch sports, half times tend to be a bit long and is just a bunch of commercials so I lower the volume of the TV as I microwave some popcorn.\\n\\nBy this point my neighbours had been fighting for about 30 minutes, and just as I take the popcorns out of the microwave I hear some doors slamming, curiosity got the better of me, so I went to my balcony to see what was the scope of the fight in case I had to call the cops of something. Now I have two dogs so I didn\\'t wanted to leave my popcorn bag unattended on the couch, so I brought it with me.\\n\\nSo here I am, staring from my balcony at the 40 year olds married couple who took the fight outside. For the looks of it the wife had kicked the husband out of the house. By now I could tell what the fight was about, nothing too dramatic as to add spice to the story or so I thought. Suddenly she slapped him hard on the face, which made him turn as I gasped dramatically, which made them both look up into my balcony.\\n\\nNow try to see this from their perspective. They\\'ve been fighting for over 30 minutes, yelling and slamming doors and just as they took their fight outside they see their gay gossip loving neighbour with a big bag of popcorn looking from their balcony. This got them furious, as if defying the laws of physics, their faces turned redder than they already were, and they both took their frustration at me yelling me all sorts of things.\\n\\n\"ENJOYING THE SHOW YOU \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*!?\"\\n\\nI honestly decided to take one for the team and kept putting popcorn into my mouth as they were yelling at me because it seemed to stop their fight and join them as a twisted dysfunctional couple once again. They both flip the finger at me as walked inside \"Can YOU BELIEVE this fucking guy!?\" the wife screamed at her husband as he patted her back and closed the door.\\n\\nWhen I got inside I was too busy laughing to enjoy the rest of the game but locally my team won 5-2 so all is good in the world.\\n\\nEdit: I know some redditors don\\'t really like this but thank you so much for the platinum, gold and silvers and all the positive fun comments I\\'ve gotten.  You all made my night incredibly fun it\\'s been a blast reading and replying to all your comments! Also shut out to all the Cruz Azul fans who guessed correctly it was the game I was watching!\\n\\nEdit 2: many users seem to think this story wasn\\'t a TIFU and it probably isn\\'t a dramatic one I\\'d say that ruining my relationship with my neighbours by being on the wrong place at the wrong time with some popcorns was a bit of a fuck up but at the end of the day isn\\'t a really big loss as it gave me a blast of a night on reddit.\\n\\nTL;DR My neighbours were having a big fight while I was watching a soccer game, I went out to check while she slapped her husband as I was holding a big bag of popcorn. My nosing around redirected their anger towards me and now they\\'re back to being a happy dysfunctional marriage again. This is the reason people create throw-aways, but screw it, it happened.\\n\\nAlso: this occurred a little over a decade ago, which will eventually be pertinent.\\n\\nFor background: At some point in my childhood, I developed pin-worms. In the interest of science, I must admit that I don\\'t know for certain that I had pin-worms, just that my mother (who was 17 when she had me in the 70\\'s and loved home remedies) had seen me scratching my bottom, for good or bad reasons concluded that I had pin-worms, and instructed me to shove a clove of garlic into my anus in order to stop the little beasties.\\n\\nI\\'m afraid that I don\\'t know if the garlic helped, or if there was any other remedy, all I remember is that as a young child I walked around for the better part of day with a piece of garlic shoved up my bum, and I don\\'t remember spending most of my childhood with an itchy asshole.\\n\\nFast forward a decade and a half: I am living on my own. Single. Re-Acclimating to the dating scene after an awkward breakup with an ex that everyone I am still close to refers to as \"She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named\". I don\\'t remember the exact moment of realization, but there was a gradual dawning....I had worms. My butt was beyond-normally itchy. Sometimes it didn\\'t phase me, but there was a reoccurring itch that couldn\\'t be sent away once it arrived. The confirmation came when I showered and cleaned my bottom, to discover on my finger a half dozen tiny, white, croissant-shaped worms who had apparently been residing on the outside of my butthole.\\n\\nI hoped they would go away. I showered multiple times a day, scouring my ass with cleanser as best as possible, even venturing the occasional soap-covered-finger up my bum to clean out the system. But every morning, I would wake up, take a shower, and discovered more tiny beasties.\\n\\nI was horrified, but I made an appointment at my local clinic. When I told the nurse over the phone that I thought I had butt-worms, she was \\\\*extremely\\\\* skeptical. She said it was \"highly unlikely\", but they would do tests.\\n\\nI went in, embarrassed as a naked nun in Sunday school, and the doctor, a friendly South-East Indian man, reiterated the nurse\\'s skepticism, could not find anything amiss when he peered up my bum, but asked me to send in a sample of the worms when they appeared and they would test.\\n\\nI was already frustrated, but I waited until the next morning, gathered up a collection of the white aliens by pressing a row of scotch-tape against my asshole, confirmed the beasties were present, and deposited them in a plastic container. Later I drove the sample to the office, and was told it would be 1-3 weeks before I would get results.\\n\\nIn the meantime, I remembered the old remedy, bought a garlic bulb from our local health food store, and shoved a clove up my bottom.\\n\\nI would like to say that as a liberal American male, I wouldn\\'t have any issue, but after 4-5 hours talking to coffee stewards, waiters, and business associates and pretending that I did not have a foreign object shoved up my rectum, I dashed to a restroom and removed the clove, horribly embarrassed, despite no one knowing what I had done.\\n\\nNow to add: I had recently started seeing a wonderful woman. We had completely hit it off: she was a vibrant redhead, curvy, brilliant, and fun; I wanted nothing but to put my best foot forward. a week after depositing the sample to the clinic and no response, she and I found ourselves showering. My hand drifted down to my butt-crack and I realized I \\\\*NEEDED\\\\* to share my story with her, despite fears that I would mark myself as tainted and never be talked to again. So I spurted it out: \"Uhm, so yeah, I...uh...think I have butt worms....\"\\n\\nShe was so practical about it. She asked to see. I pulled apart my cheeks, swiped my fingers between them, and pulled up a few white croissant specks for her to investigate.\\n\\n\"See,\" I said, embarrassed. \"Worms.\"\\n\\n...\\n\\n\"That\\'s toilet paper\", she replied.\\n\\n\"W...what?\"\\n\\n\"Yeah,\" she said, nonchalantly\". \"That\\'s toilet paper.\"\\n\\nEverything fell into place. About a month ago, when finances got tight, I swapped my normal TP roll with Dollar Store discount brand, which was apparently breaking apart after I wiped, creating croissant shaped rolls on my bottom that caused itching.\\n\\nMy relief was intense, mixed with colossal embarrassment . My shower companion was nothing but amused and gracious.\\n\\nTLDR: I spent the better part of a day with garlic shoved up my bum because I bought cheap toilet paper.\\n\\nPostscript: Shower companion and I just celebrated our 8th year wedding anniversary. So this happened about an hour ago and I’m just sitting in at a cafe, trying to stop cringing in embarrassment. \\n\\nI’m on vacation with my wife and her family and we arrived at the hotel today, checked in and settled into our rooms. A while later a few of us headed out to explore- I went and met up with a friend who lived in the area and ended up having a few drinks.\\n\\nEarlier while I was out, I had got a text from my wife saying that she was switching our room with her parents’ as ours had a balcony while theirs didn’t, which her dad wanted so he could smoke (and that she was going out for dinner with her mom). Anyway I saw it, said ok fine, agreed to switch keycards with him once I got back. \\n\\nA few hours later, I was a bit drunk and my friend dropped me back to the hotel. The text had completely slipped my mind and so I headed to the room with the balcony where her parents were staying and, thinking it was ours, went right in.\\n\\nAs I went in, I heard the shower running in the bathroom and, feeling promiscuous, I decided to give who I thought was a my wife in the shower and little surprise. So I stripped down (completely naked) and, seeing that the door was slightly ajar, decided to barge in. So I did. While also announcing quite loudly, “Daddy’s home!”. \\n\\nThe sight that lay before me is one that’ll be stuck in my mind forever- my father-in-law, naked in the shower, looking at in a mixture of disbelief, confusion and- mostly- anger.\\n\\nI froze, and for a second we just stood there in silence, which was soon broken by him shouting- “What the FUCK (my name)”. \\n\\nAt this point my flight response kicked in and, as fast as I could, rushed out, dressed faster than I ever have before in my life, and ran out the room. \\n\\nSince I don’t have the keycard for the other room and sure as hell am not going back to ask for it, I’m now sitting at this cafe outside the hotel. I’m waiting for my wife to get back from her dinner as I don’t really think I can explain what just happened over the phone, if I can explain it without dying of embarrassment at all. So yeah, the family brunch tomorrow should be interesting...\\n\\nTL;DR: Switched hotel rooms with wife’s parents, got drunk, accidentally went into their room, barged into bathroom while FIL was showering\\n\\nUPDATE: My FIL told my MIL and my wife, and both of them pretty much died of laughter. He also isn’t too upset, just told my wife to tell me I know “who daddy is around here”, who promptly relayed this message to me. Currently with the wife in OUR room, trying to get the aforementioned image out of my mind and avoided the in-laws at all costs. Also would like to clarify I did NOT know what promiscuous actually means, I swear... I applied SPF 100 sport spray, every hour (give or take) for roughly 4 hours. I was hanging out at the lake and at slightly higher elevations so the water reflection and elevation probably increased the damage. \\n\\nI pretty much had no idea that I had a problem until I scratched an itch on my back and it hurt really bad. I considered for a split second that I had a burn but like an idiot, I rationalized it as \"sunblock burned the broken skin from the scratch\". \\n\\nThe blisters formed by the next day and I started reading the can to see if I missed something about applying it. I found the customer service number and called it. Before talking to anyone, I heard a recording tell me that the FDA doesn\\'t require expiration dates on sunblock and to consider it expired after 3 years. This bottle was easily 4-5 years old.\\n\\nI had no clue. \\n\\nI went to the doc and got some amazing medicated gauze and they sent me home with pain meds after cleaning the burn off and showing everyone in the building. \\n\\nIt was easily one of the most painful things I have ever experienced. Except when my tank top straps got dried to my blisters on my shoulders and became part of the blister scabs overnight. Trying to pull them off was almost blackout pain. I soaked in a tub for a while until they basically melted off. \\n\\n\\nThis was preventable- Sunblock expires, please check yours and make sure you store it according to the instructions. \\n\\nNSFL\\n https://imgur.com/3nge8Nm.jpg \\n\\n\\nEDIT- I want to clear up: I\\'m naturally, very pale person, I was at high altitude while on and in the water. I do not blame anyone but myself for this. Whether expired or I stored it incorrectly whatever it was- it was my own fault. I should have been careful with making sure the things I use to protect my skin were being used as they should have been. \\nI agree that all sunblock should have expiration dates, I just don\\'t blame anyone but myself for my lack of due diligence. \\nThis isn\\'t a chemical burn, just a bad burn on skin that rarely sees the sun with a few contributing circumstances that made it worse. \\n\\nI\\'m not planning to sue anyone although I appreciate and understand why it is being suggested. \\nI just want people to have all the information to protect their skin! Be safe! Skin cancer is a real danger.\\n\\nTL;DR- Sunblock expires. So first of all, I\\'m an 19 year old guy and everyone involved in the butt competition was between the ages of 18 and 20. Alt-account as I don\\'t want my friends to know my actual reddit account. TL;DR at the end.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo  it al started around a week ago when some girls in my friend group came together and started drinking. They started boasting about their butt and next thing you know they wanted to do a best butt competition. I wasn\\'t there so I don\\'t know details but we were send a message in a group chat. Rules were simple, if you wanted to join you just had to send a pic of your butt to this certain girl who would present them anonymously to  8 guys and they would all vote for the picture of the best butt.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWell, I thought it would be funny to join, but I knew that they wouldn\\'t take it seriously because my ass is naturally extremely hairy. So I did the most logical thing at the time. I shaved it. I took the shaving equipment I normally use for my face, switched the knifes and went ham. Well this is were the first problem came in. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe stupid person I am didn\\'t lock the door. My mom walked in on me shaving my ass. She just awkwardly wiggled away and I turned extremely red. She didn\\'t say anything, so I thought she would just ignore it. Well she didn\\'t. She started googling. That evening, she asked me to come to the dinner table to talk. My father ran away so I knew it would be bad, but I didn\\'t expect it to be that bad. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nShe wanted to talk about *intercourse safety in a homosexual relationship*. Keep in mind, I\\'m not actually gay. She was extremely well prepared. Highlights of that evening were practicing with a condom and a cucumber, the dangers of gay sex without lube, and a brief summary of objects I should definitely not put in my butt (such as lamps and beer bottles). She would not listen to any of my denying and would just say: \"its okay, Your dad and I still love you\".\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI thought the worst was over so I send a picture of my shaven butt to the girl that was collecting them. 2 days later the 9 pictures of all the contestants were send, all without any distinguishable features, to the  8 boys. So one thing you should now is that I do have quite a good butt. I got pretty good genes in that aspect and I\\'ve been skating since I was 14. I now skate around 60km a week and skating is  an incredible way to get a firm round butt of decent size. You can probably see where this is going. I won with a total of 5 out of 8 votes. 1 picture got 2 votes and 1 got 1 vote. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe fallout from this was not that big. Some of the more prideful girls wanted to start some drama, but they didn\\'t want to admit their butt lost to a boy, I didn\\'t talk a lot with them anyway and Covid makes drama a little more difficult, so that was simply ignored by most of us. Our mix-gendered trip to a lake when lockdown  would end did turn a guys only trip as some of the girls suddenly didn\\'t really feel like going and the rest didn\\'t want to go to a lake with a such a one-sided girl/boy-ratio. I do want to say that most of the girls did think it was hilarious on some sort of level and the one that didn\\'t are famous in our group for being extremely prideful. It is, however, extremely awkward to talk with most of them as they now look at my ass quite frequently.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t stop with this by the way. I was gaming with my friends today and we started talking about the butt competition. We kept it anonymous which butt was from what person and the people that voted didn\\'t know who won yet and I did not know who the guys that voted were. Well, the guy I was gaming with happened to be one of the people voting. He said he couldn\\'t chose between two and so he started masturbating and voted for the one he came on. I said something along the lines of \\'that\\'s gross AF\\'. He than said something like \\'You would understand if you saw the butt and than proceeded to send the picture he voted for via snapchat. It was mine. I didn\\'t tell him, but I now have to live with the knowledge that a good friend of mine came on a picture of my shaven ass.\\n\\nEdit: Alright, this became a lot mor popular than I thought it would be. I\\'m happy my awkward life is amusing random strangers on the internet.\\n\\nFirst a little update: the guy has probably seen this post and recognized it as he just sent me a text which states \\'sorry\\'. Nothing more. He wont answer any texts, from me or my friends. I\\'ll try again tomorrow.\\n\\nYes, my mom is a great person. She was raised in an extremely strict catholic household. She stayed a catholic (going to church twice a week) but never wanted her kids to feel forced to be anything their not.\\n\\nOne thing some people seem to misunderstand is that my butt is extremely incredible to win against cheerleaders, actresses and models. My friendgroup exists out of the d&d players, the art kids, and the alternative crowd. Even though we have some incredibly beautiful people here, we were never the jaw-dropping popular crowd. Which is okay, as we always had fun.\\n\\nI AM NOT A DUDE WITH A BRAZILIAN WOMAN\\'S ASS.\\n\\nalso thanks for the medals and the tips for caring after my shaven ass. I didn\\'t think about aftercare until you guys said anything.\\n\\nAlso, I\\'m not posting pictures of my ass so that thousands of strangers can see it. Sorry, but I\\'m just not risking it.\\n\\nEdit 2: Fine, you guys win. You know how many requests I\\'ve got for butts? Way too many. Absolutely abnormal. I don\\'t want my bare ass to end up on the internet so I\\'ll make one wearing something were you can see the shape of it tomorrow. God damn perverts. For now I\\'ll go to sleep.\\n\\nEdit 3: So first the updates. My friend said he is actually straight. He still a little quieter than usual, but he can see the joke. Hope it thought him not to masturbate to random people.\\n\\nMy mom loves you guys. I told her the whole story (minus the part about my friend cumming). She thought it was funny and said that she believed me to be bisexual for a long time and thought that me shaving was me getting ready for butt stuff. She wanted to have that talk for quite sometime.\\n\\nSome people don\\'t understand how the competition was played. The girl I send my picture to was not a contestant but more of a referee. She sent it to 8 guys that were not a part of the friend group and told them that these were of a few of her friends amd they should pick out their favourite. Later she send the results. It was a complete coincidence that my friend was a voter.\\n\\nThe TIFU continued by the way. My ass is itching. Like a lot. Dammit.\\n\\nLastly: You know what, I\\'m not going to send the pictures. Some of you guys are absolute beast. WTF. In the time that I was sleeping I got multiple messages from old man between the age of 50 and 70 talking about what they would do to my ass. I do not want them or any of the other disgusting people to have pictures of my butt. \\n\\nAdd to that some people that have been spamming me for complete nudes. Just because you are anonymous does not mean you can be a disgusting pest.\\n\\nIf it was for the laughs it would be okay, but some of you actually scare me. 1 guy even found my main account. How?\\n\\nI feel truly sorry for the girls on this platform as I completely understand why anyone would delete their account. \\n\\nSorry, to all the people that were just curious or thought it was funny, but I\\'m just not comfortable with it anymore. I hope you understand.\\n\\nTL;DR: Shaved my ass and entered a butt competition, made life awkward with my mom, a few of my female friends and 1 male friend. I currently work for my local government in their communications department making videos, fliers, social media posts, and pretty much everything else they need. Part of the job involves putting in placeholder text and links since I\\'ll be told \"We need a link to this resource but it\\'s not available\".\\n\\nThere\\'s an unspoken agreement that if I\\'m not given an actual link, I will link to random things; sometimes it\\'s a viral video, sometimes it\\'s an anime meme, and sometimes it\\'s music videos to what I\\'m listening to. This is just for the draft so it doesn\\'t matter and usually just gives me something fun to add on. For the past few months, I\\'ve been working on a large campaign of flyers to promote a program to my neighboring area of half a million people and at the time. At the time, I was listneing to a lot of 80s new wave and decided to see if anyone is actually testing that the QR codes and shorteners work that I directed everything to go to Rick Astley; figured if anyoned checked it, I\\'d get an email commenting on it.\\n\\nTime goes by, the official links are the last to be given to me so I add them in, send everything to my supervisor to approve before going to the printer to have 5,000 copies printed of each variation. My work with the project is done and now it\\'s up to others to start putting them while I move on to the next project; that was two weeks ago. This morning, I get pulled into a zoom meeting with the other department heads and their bosses. They ask me about the link and I tell them I checked the QR code and shortener before sending it for review and if there\\'s a error to look at the printer. I even pull up the finalized versions and verified it works. They get more serious and say that the printer wouldn\\'t replace the links with a music video, thinking I screwed up or just did it on purpose. Turns out that the posters and fliers had been put around the county in local businesses, bus stops, out lobbies, etc and emails started to come in. I\\'m more surprised that anyone actually used the QR codes or links to begin with.\\n\\nAfter getting grilled, thinking I was going to get fired, I forwarded the email I sent to my supervisor with the final versions of the graphics and they went to the correct links. The best we can figure out is that since there had been dozens of versions over a few months that someone along the chain of command mixed up an earlier version that included the Rickroll link when placing the order; no one wants to take blame for it.  We\\'re currently in the proces of retrieving everything and debating on having stickers printed out to cover the links or pay to have everything reprinted. Even though it wasn\\'t my fault, I\\'m now suppose to use dummy links and QR codes that go to an image of a tree; my time of adding random music videos has been halted.\\n\\nTL;DR: TIFU by an early version of a multi-city promotional fliers got sent to the printers that contained  draft links to \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" by Rick Astley instead of the correct version and was only discovered after they had already been put up across the area.\\n\\nEdit: Hot damn! Didn\\'t expect my 4am \"I need to take a break from my workload\" post to take off. Thank you all for the awards and assuring me that my placeholder methods are genius!\\n\\nFront page edit: Since this is making the rounds on design subreddits and discords, might as well plug [my portfolio](https://shorturl.at/ctMO8) in the event I get fired and need a new job.   I actually posted this on Am I The Asshole few days back. Some people suggested I post this here as well, so here goes. \\n\\n\\nThis story has four characters ; my husband (28m), me(27f), mother in law and father in law. \\n\\nEven though husband and I are Indians, we’re from different states. He’s from North India and I’m from West India. MIL thinks I don’t know their native language. Thing is,I do understand it. I’ve picked up a lot of words and phrases from hearing my husband speak and and from songs etc. I understand enough to comprehend. \\n\\nWe could be at dinner at my in laws house and the conversation would go like this : \\n\\nMIL : *switches to her native tongue and makes some  remark about me.* \\n\\nHusband: *defends me in native tongue. Asks her to stop* \\n\\n\\nThis used to be very funny to me because these people thought I did not know what they were saying about me and I found his mother’s remarks very Indian mother-ish. Nothing offensive really. \\n\\nFor example, she’d say to my face that the food I cooked is tasty but then switch to her native language and go,’ There’s so much salt in it. Is your wife trying to give me a Blood Pressure problem?’ Sometimes it was hard to keep a straight face. \\n\\n\\nFew days back, we were face timing with my in laws and my MIL says something in the native tongue. This is where the fuck up happens. I wasn’t paying attention and I thought she spoke to me so I replied in the same language. Now, I didn’t even know if I could speak it since I’d never really tried. I thought it was more of a ‘I understand but I can’t speak it’. If the ‘surprised pikachu meme’ was real, it would be the expressions of my husband and his parents. I don’t think I’ll ever forget how their faces looked. I wish I could’ve taken a pic. \\n\\n\\nMIL has been sugary sweet to me. She’s been sending all these ‘good mornings’ and ‘hope u well’ texts to me.I hate this new MIL. I prefer her subtle way of being fake than her obvious way of being fake. I feel like I lost a super power. I won’t get to hear MIL’s running commentary about me. Those were entertaining af. I looked forward to family dinners just for her taunts which she thought I couldn’t understand. I really fucked up bad by slipping up.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR didn’t tell my husband that I could understand his language, had fun while MIL taunted me in the said language, lost this superpower now. Hey! Y\\'all remember me? Yesterday, I made [this post] (https://old.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/a2pdlw/tifu_by_making_a_girl_i_like_laugh_so_hard_she/) about when I almost killed a girl by making them laugh so hard it caused an asthma flare-up. Well, thanks to the incredible support of the reddit community (I got hundreds of pms urging me to go for it yall be crazy lol) I asked her out. And guess what....\\n\\nAfter promising it most likely would not result in another hospital trip, she said yes! We\\'re going out this Friday for a dinner. I know some people warned me about dating people at work, but honestly after what I happened I think I’m kinda obligated by the universe to go for it. \\n\\nThanks for giving me the support to do it guys. I was gonna flake-out.\\nSo remember ladies and gents, if you ever have a crush on them, fucking dab on them. If it works with the haters, it\\'ll work with the lovers.\\n\\nTL;DR. Gave a girl an asthma attack by dabbing on them. They laughed too hard and ended up in the hospital. Reddit made me work up up the courage to ask them out. Somehow it worked. What the hell. \\n\\nEdit: Thank you for all the awesome support guys!!! Just for the hell of it, I\\'ll be posting updates of how it goes on /r/DateFromADab if you\\'re interested!!!\\n\\n\\n So my birthday is coming up and I found an item on eBay that I thought would be cool as a present. I figured I would casually mention it to both my wife and my mom...not thinking that either of them would actually try to bid on it.\\n\\nWell lo and behold, they BOTH ended up bidding on it to try to win it for a birthday present for me and they unknowingly got into a bidding war with each other!!! They ended up driving up the price by about $200 before my wife finally won the auction. They could have just bought it new in the store for $50 less then she won it for!\\n\\nTL;DR: I mentioned to both my wife and mom about an item on eBay I thought would be nice for my birthday...they unknowingly got into a bidding war against each other and drove the price up considerably.\\n As usual, this did not happen today...but rather 7 months ago. I\\'d like to preface this story by saying that at the time of this incident I was 29 years old. First, a little back story...\\n\\nSunday, April 2, 2017 started like any other Sunday for me. I woke up, did a little workout and then headed out for the day to get some errands done. Number 1 on the agenda was to get both my girlfriend\\'s oil changed, as well as my own. I drove down to the oil place and got hers done first, then drove back to her house and picked up my car. I drove back to oil change place in my car and had them start on changing the oil on my car. I was sitting in the waiting room watching youtube videos when the event occurred that would forever change my life.\\n\\nAs I watched the video I felt a headache hit right behind my right eye and travel straight back to the back of my skull. Having never had a migraine before, I assumed that this is what it feels like and muscled through it. The pain was unrelenting but not unbearable, though I was a bit concerned at how fast it struck. They finished the oil and as they did, I texted my girlfriend to let her know that I had a headache and would be heading back to her house to nap it off.\\n\\nI got back to her house, popped a couple Ibuprofen (mistake) and took a nap. I woke up hours later still feeling this intense pain in my head. I decided I would sleep it off the rest of the night and in the morning I would be good to go to work.\\n\\nI woke up Monday morning still feeling like shit and decided I was in 0 shape to drive to work, let alone work construction all day with the way that my head was feeling. My girlfriend tried her best to convince me that I needed to go to the ER but I told her I just needed more rest and would be fine. She reluctantly let me try to rest as much as I could for the rest of the day, but my symptoms were not getting better. The only relief I could find was taking pain killers, which I\\'m not a big fan of, and napping.\\n\\nI woke up Tuesday with the same symptoms and it was at this point that my girlfriend decided, \"enough is enough.\" Against my protest, she dragged me to the ER...and saved my life.\\n\\nI went in to the ER and told them my symptoms, also telling them that I have an extreme phobia of hypodermic needles and anything intravenous. They sent me to do a CT scan of my head, without the contrast because I wouldn\\'t let them tap an IV on my arm. The CT scan was performed and I was brought back to the room to await the results. As I sat there I caught the Dr. who was seeing me jogging down the hallway. \"It was at this point I knew....something was fucked up!\" (Dave Chappelle voice)\\n\\nThe Dr. came flying into the room and said, \"Hey listen man, you\\'ve had a stroke and you\\'ve got a pretty major bleed going in your brain right now. I need to tap an IV on you right now, do another CT scan with the contrast and then get you out of this hospital and to Stanford ASAP!\"\\n\\nMy life stopped. \"A stroke? I\\'m 29? How could I have had a stroke?\" I couldn\\'t comprehend what was happening but I looked to my girlfriend and asked her to phone my mother right away. I got on the phone with my mom and, while choking back tears, tried to explain to her what was happening. (Side note: I live in California but grew up in New Jersey which is where all my family still resides) I quickly gave her a brief run down and then got off the phone as the doctors were trying to move quickly on this. I asked her to please call my dad and hung up.\\n\\nWhat happened next is a whirlwind. They tapped an IV, did a CT scan then I was transported by ambulance to Stanford ICU. I was greeted by the entire Neurology department, both residents and students alike. The first woman I met said she, \"couldn\\'t believe I was even still awake, let alone walking and talking.\" She told me, \"usually with something like this there are only two ways people come in here: either in a coma...or dead.\"\\n\\nAs I laid in ICU they tapped an A-line, directly into the artery in my wrist and then two more IV\\'s (for a total of 4) into my other arm. They had me sign over my power of attorney right away because they were absolutely sure that my condition would deteriorate and I wouldn\\'t be capable of making decisions for myself. They were artificially lowering my blood pressure to prevent more bleeding  into the brain, as well as, had some other fluids running through me.\\n\\nMy parents flew in from Jersey by the next day and I was sent for an angiogram later that afternoon (Wednesday). If you\\'ve never had an angiogram...consider yourself lucky. I\\'ve had 3. They lay you on a table and sedate you with drugs, though you are NOT asleep. They then tap your femoral artery through your groin and run a catheter all the way up to your neck where they directly inject contrast dye to get a more clear picture of the veins and arteries in your brain. Let me repeat, YOU ARE AWAKE FOR THIS!\\n\\nThe first angiogram was inconclusive because there was too much blood in my brain. The blood actually blocked the picture and they couldn\\'t see anything. I was stabilized, the bleed had stopped and I was allowed to leave the hospital by Friday morning. I used up all my FMLA leave (12 weeks) and have been on disability since.\\n\\nBut wait...there\\'s MORE!!!\\n\\n6 weeks later I had to go back to Stanford for another angiogram to try and solve the mystery of what caused the stroke. This time they found the culprit. I had what is known as an Arterioveneous Fistula burst inside my brain. It\\'s when an artery incorrectly attaches itself to a vein and pumps high pressure blood into a low pressure system, thus causing the vein to burst. To my understanding, the only way this happens is either from a major blow to the head (which I did not take) or from a case of bad luck (which sounds more my speed).\\n\\n6 weeks after finding out what caused the stroke I went in to have a fully invasive surgery performed to fix the issue. I was put to sleep, had my head cut open and my brain operated on for 12 hours by the BEST neurosurgeons in the world. A 3rd angiogram was performed while I was asleep because they could not locate the fistula at first.\\n\\nI awoke later that night in the most immense amount of pain I have ever been in. While I was asleep, two more IV\\'s had been put into my arm, an A-line had been put in my wrist again, and I had a C-line, which is an IV in your chest that runs to your heart, put in as well. The fentanyl was about 5 minutes of relief followed by 55 minutes of me begging for more pain killers. They could only dose me once per hour...needless to say it was the longest night of my life.\\n\\nThe surgery was a complete success and the doctors told me I would never have to deal with something like this happening again in my life. The next day after the surgery I realized that I had double vision so bad that I couldn\\'t see with both my eyes open. It was either one or the other. I had to patch my eye until I could see a vision therapist a few weeks later. My surgery was on a Wednesday and by Friday I was released, though still in an incredible amount of pain.\\n\\nFast forward, to October 2, 2017.\\n\\nMy vision was nearly back to normal and after 6 months of being on disability, I was finally ready to return to work. I was so excited my first day back, even though I wasn\\'t in the field and was simply doing work in the tool room. Around 11:30 AM I took my lunch and finished reading my book I had been reading. At 12:30 PM I returned to work and about 10 minutes later I decided I had to use the bathroom. I left the tool room trailer, walked across the yard to bathroom, did my business and walked back to the tool room. As I walked back, I looked to my left to see what foreman had just pulled back into the yard, then quickly back to the tool room door....only....there was a problem.\\n\\nI could see the door, but in my peripheral vision there was what I describe as a floating bubble, that had the scene from my left still playing in it like it was on repeat and it was flashing like a strobe light. I got into the tool room, sat down and tried my best to blink away whatever this was. I started getting nauseous, light headed and my left foot began to tingle. I think I tried to call my fiance (we got engaged after the stroke in April) for help but I don\\'t remember because I blacked out. Next thing I remember was a foreman standing over me asking if I was alright and all I could think was, \"how\\'d this guy get in my bedroom?\"\\n\\nI was delirious, I had smashed my face on the concrete when I fell and had busted my eye and bent my glasses. My supervisor took me to the ER where they did CT scans, blood work, EKG and chest x-rays. My white cell count was through the roof but they couldn\\'t find any sign of infection so they diagnosed it as dehydration and syncopy (passing out).\\n\\nI did a follow up with my PCP (primary care physician) and when looking at the blood work she asked for me to go back to Stanford Neurology to talk with them. And so I have...and this is where I am today...\\n\\nI was diagnosed with a seizure disorder. The issue, as I\\'ve been told, is a direct result of the stroke and not the surgery. Due to the amount of time I allowed blood to flow into my brain, it has caused bruising and damage to that area of my brain which is what lead to me having the seizure. Had I gone to the ER right when it happened, things may be different today.\\n\\nWhat this means for me now is I\\'ll likely lose my Class A license and my career of doing physical work is over. Thank God the company I work for is so large that they can move me to another position where I won\\'t be doing that type of work, however, that still does not change the hurt and disappointment I feel. Working construction has been my all time favorite. I\\'m a blue collar guy and I get a sense of accomplishment at the end of each day. I\\'ve poured blood, sweat and tears into this career and now that aspect of it is over. My days of being on a crew, joking around with the guys and generally having a good time while doing the physical work we do is DONE. It sucks. I\\'m not happy about it, but I don\\'t let it change my outlook on life.\\n\\nI refuse to give up on life. I can get through anything and I WILL get through this. I\\'m out of work until January 8, 2018 at which point I will return and meet my new tasks with the same passion as I did before.\\n\\nI tell this story as a bit of caution to anyone else out there. Please, I\\'m begging you! If you ever feel like something is wrong with you...DO NOT HESITATE! GO TO THE HOSPITAL! Don\\'t be like me, Mr. Toughguy, thinking you can get through it. You know your body better than anyone else on this planet, which means you also know when things aren\\'t right.\\n\\nI thank you all for taking the time out of your day to read my story. May God bless your life and your health\\n\\n-ZK\\n\\n(TLDR: Had a stroke at age 29, almost died, had brain surgery, recovered, went back to work only to have a seizure my first day back caused by the stroke and am still awaiting return to work)\\n\\n[Edit: Here are some pics of when I was in the hospital and the recovery of the incision.]\\n\\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Enbwl3S.jpg\\nhttps://i.imgur.com/PzvMaWb.jpg\\nhttps://i.imgur.com/7IVzKyD.jpg\\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Ri55Sk2.jpg\\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Zri1BB5.jpg This started yesterday but I didn\\'t realize my FU until today.\\n\\nYesterday, I stumbled on a price mistake for the 6 qt Instant Pot at Target, they were ringing up at $10 a piece instead of $80. I decided I would get some Christmas shopping done early and flip a few. I ordered 10 for in store pick up and 10 for delivery in case either order got canceled.\\n\\nWell the delivery order was canceled but a got an email that the in store pickup was ready. I go to Target and give them my ID, they look it up and can\\'t find it at first. I give them the order number and I hear the one guy say to the other something about it being canceled and they are both giving my odd looks. The one says he has to let the manager know I\\'m there so they radio over and the manager says it was canceled because of the price mistake. Seems a little odd that they needed the manager over the radio just for that but I didn\\'t think much of it.\\n\\nFast forward to a little earlier this afternoon. The doorbell rings and my wife comes and tells me there are 2 guys at the door asking for me. I step outside and they identify themselves as detectives from the State Police Counter Terrorism Unit and they start questioning me about why I\\'m trying to buy 10 pressure cookers and if I know what they can be used for, if I\\'m making bombs and so on; they even have a picture of my car from in the Target parking lot. I did my best to explain the price mistake and how I found it, etc. I think they accepted my explanation but I\\'m still nervous that I\\'m on a watchlist now.\\n\\nTL:DR tried to take advantage of a price mistake and buy 10 Instant Pots at Target, got interrogated by State Police Counter Terrorism Unit why I was buying 10 pressure cookers that could be used to make bombs.\\n\\nEdit: here\\'s the investigator\\'s card since so many people seem to be doubting my story. I covered up personal info so I don\\'t dox him or myself. \\nhttps://i.imgur.com/fFFw7CX.jpg Last month my husband of 15 years went on a week long golf trip with his buddies. Before he left I joked around with him about him all about the legal brothels there are outside of Vegas. And jokingly said,  \"Wrap that sucker up if you go get some spendy strange!\"\\n \\nHe goes, he golfs, he drinks, he comes home. Life continues as normal, which includes us having sex about once a day. My 44th birthday was Wednesday and he went out of his way to assure I felt loved and not as old as I am. \\n\\nLast night I was in the bath when I noticed an STD looking wart on my outer lady bits. Having never had a wart- thing on  my body before, I immediately decide the dude has cheated on me. \\n\\nI flew from the tub to the TV room and start yelling, accusing him of fucking whores in Vegas, and I all-around lose my shit. I scream-explain my new STD to him, and tell him he\\'s gotta leave because we\\'re done. \\n\\nI\\'m furious. I\\'m pissed... and he\\'s just about pissing his pants to keep from laughing, when he walks over shows me a spot on his elbow and asks if my new STD \"looks like this?\" \\n\\nIt did. \\n\\nTurns out it\\'s a skin tag, which are a weird flap of skin that becomes more common as you get older. (I\\'ve since googled it and it\\'s undeniably a skin tag.)\\n\\nHe knew it was on me from prior visits to my nethers but never said anything, assuming I knew about it. He kissed me on top of my head and walked away while bent over laugh-crying. \\n\\nThis was last night and he has not stopped laughing and is now referring to me as \"dumbass\" a name I\\'ve 100% earned. \\n\\nTL:DR- I accused my husband of giving me an STD, turns out it\\'s an old age skin tag, and I\\'m an idiot.\\n\\n\\nEDIT: Y\\'all, my ridiculous and irrational overreaction IS WHY THIS IS A TIFU. \\n\\nEDIT 2: My apologies to this wonderful man have been plentiful, sincere,  and oral. However, we both keep laughing at how stupid I was that the sexy time becomes too goofy.\\n\\nEDIT 3: We\\'re happily married guys. I may be a lunatic, but we\\'re a great match. Thanks for all the advice for him to leave me, but as he reads through the comments he\\'s assured me y\\'all are more crazy than I am.\\n\\nEDIT 4: Once a day on average. My guy is hot, and getting more so every year! So didn\\'t happen today, but rather yesterday. I invited a close friend to the movies with me. A few odd things happened, and it wasn\\'t until I spoke to a friend of mine that I realized I missed multiple hints that she was into me. \\n\\n1) Beforehand, I jokingly texted her about a time a friend of mine and I got stuck in town for four hours charging in front of a hotel (my car is electric). She replies \"Don\\'t worry, if that were you and I, we\\'d make the most of it\" with a wink face after. I laughed it off and forgot about it. \\n\\n2) Driving home, she tells me about her friends which \\'know of every hidden fucking-spot\\' between the country roads that we were passing through, even pointing out a few. I replied, \"I guess that\\'s an interesting thing to know\" with a laugh. She then looks to my backseat and goes \"yeah, there\\'s not much you could do in [my car] though\". I then replied \"You know probably not\" and thought no more of it.\\n\\n3) When we get back to her house, she asks if I want to go inside to get a soda, to which I politely declined because I wasn\\'t thirsty.\\n\\nTLDR: I missed strong signs that she was dtf\\n\\n\\nEdit: There is an upside to this however: she\\'s very eager to go to the movies again.\\n\\nEdit Edit: Wow this blew up! I guess it was that bad, thanks everyone\\n\\nEdit: the first dialogue exchange was done over text, sorry for the confusion So, as I was making myself breakfast this morning, I for some reason started wondering what would happen if I touched one of the glowing wires inside the toaster while it was on. Being the very intelligent man I am, I of course did not want to touch it with my bare hands. I instead took a fork out of the drawer and without thinking, sticked it right into the toaster. A small bolt of electricity shot up from the toaster and the toaster shut itself off.\\n\\nThe worst part is, I still didn\\'t realize what I had actually just done. I just thought, \"uh huh, whatever\" and put the fork back into the drawer. As I grabbed the bread it clicked on me that there is a current running through the wires and that I had almost electrocuted myself. Maybe I was saved by my other hand not being on the dishwashing table, which is made of metal. If I had been  leaning against the tabletop to reach the toaster better, I would have gotten an electric shock.\\n\\nI haven\\'t told anyone yet, and I don\\'t think I will.\\n\\nTl;dr: Curiosity almost killed the cat. This happened a few weeks ago.\\n\\nMy ~6 year old son came running in to my home office the other day and said, demandingly, \"Dad! Kick me!\"\\n\\nSo I did.\\n\\nHear me out, please. The kick was a 3/10 on firmness. Not gentle, but not painful. He\\'s a kid, he likes to play fight, and as he\\'s an only child, I feel like I need to provide a bit of rough and tumble so that he can learn boundaries. I also want him to \"lose some battles\", and to learn to \"roll with the punches\". \\n\\nAnyway... I performed a front kick whilst making the Bruce Lee Noise. I trust that you know the one. \\n\\nMy son recoiled. He looked shocked, sad and disappointed, all rolled into one. He didn\\'t cry,, but it was close.\\n\\nHe blurted out \"I said KISS Me!!!\"\\n\\nOops!\\n\\n\\n\\nTLDR; I misheard my son, which resulted in me kicking him. So a few weeks ago I woke up to a wonderful suprise. My roommate made me an omelette and brought it to me at my desk.  I was really happy that they went out of their way to cook for me. \\n\\nHowever when I took a bite I was in for a suprise. It was a cold omelette with horseradish Swiss cheese, sour raisins, and prunes. It was... disturbingly gross. I couldn\\'t even swallow one bite. I really couldn\\'t eat it.\\n\\nLater in the day, my roommate came by to ask how it was. I was mostly distracted with work so I just said that I was thankful he cooked for me. \\n\\nBecause he doesn\\'t cook a lot, I thought that I wouldn\\'t have to address the abomination and we\\'d just go back to usual. Well... He took the positive encouragement and has started expirementing with all kinds of wierd flavour combinations.\\n \\nThis morning I woke up to a garlic, cheese, and dried cranberries omelette and it was even worse than the first. I feel like I\\'m in too deep at this point. I don\\'t have the heart to tell him that I don\\'t like even like omelettes. I like plain scrambled eggs. \\n\\nTl;Dr- My roommate made gross food. I thought it was a one time thing so I gave positive feedback. Now my life is wierd wierd omelettes.\\n\\nEdit: holy cow. This blew up. Just sending love and good vibes to all. May all your food be tasty, and all your roommates be as nice as mine, but may they be much much much better cooks.\\n\\nUpdate: for everyone offering advice, the plan is definitely to communicate that this combination is\\n... heinous, but in a nice and respectful way. I\\'m sure they would appreciate knowing what I actually like so that their effort is edible AND a really nice thing\\n\\nFinal update: we spoke, next day he made a plain egg for me. And I made tacos for both of us. So wins for all. Obligatory \"this happened two days ago.\"\\n\\nI had been together with my girlfriend for almost 4 years. I proposed to her about a month ago, she said yes, and we were incredibly happy! Or so I thought. \\n\\nAbout 3 weeks after our proposal, I notice she starts acting different. Not having sex with me, looking away/down when we kiss. She had also been spending way too much time (at least 4 days of M-F each week) with her coworkers drinking beer after work, driving home drunk, and often pretty late. I went to a few of these gatherings but didn\\'t really enjoy getting slammed on a monday night when I have work the next day, so I often opted out.\\n\\nWe would also share our google location with each other at all times. Mostly because she traveled to sketchy places for work, and I would regularly go on trails, so it helped each of us know the other was safe. I looked at her location one day and it was turned off. I texted her about it and she said that she kept receiving notifications about it so she had turned it off. Hadn\\'t been a problem for the past year. She turned it back on, and it was off again the next day. She also had two phones, a personal and a work phone, which she would keep both with her at all times. I only had the location for the personal phone. Eventually she stopped using her personal phone and only used the work phone.\\n\\nTwo days ago, about a month after the proposal, I decided to snoop because my suspicion was at it\\'s highest, and I just wanted to put it to rest. I used her computer to log into her gmail account and looked at her timeline. She had been going to an address across town about 10 times in the past two weeks. I called her immediately because she said she was at the office finishing up some work that was due the next day. She said she was at work, but leaving to go to the grocery store, which she then did.\\n\\nI waited until she got home and confronted her about it. She said she had been meeting a guy from work just to talk and hang out, but she didn\\'t want to tell me because she thought I would get mad. Turns out, she met him for the first time about 2 days after the proposal, and started seeing him at his house within that week. I kept prying, asking her more questions, she told me they had only kissed twice, then it turned into they had made out, and she denied every accusation of sleeping with him every time I asked.\\n\\nThe next day when I got home from work, I asked to see her phone to read the messages between the two of them. She said she deleted them. So I said I wanted to look at it anyways, just to be sure. I started recovering the data from the last backup. She sat down beside me while I was doing it, and asked what I was doing. I told her, and the look of panic in her face was real! So she starts talking about feelings and all this other crap while the phone is recovering. I asked her one last time, \"before I look at this, is there anything you want to tell me?\" She was silent. I asked flat out \"did you sleep with him?\" and she said yes. Turns out that she met with him almost every day, starting about 8 days after the proposal and had sex with him most of those. Funny enough, the data recovery didn\\'t even work. So that\\'s a win I guess.\\n\\nPlanning on moving my stuff out later this week to a new place. Havn\\'t told her yet. Still can\\'t believe she started cheating on me less than two weeks after she said yes to my proposal, and even more so with someone she met a few days after the proposal. Feels shitty but I\\'m keeping my head up.\\n\\nTLDR; TIFU by looking at my fiances location history and found out she started sleeping with another guy less than two weeks after she said yes to my proposal. It has been one month since the proposal now.\\n\\nEdit: Wow! Thank you all for the encouraging comments! They help so much more than I would\\'ve thought. Some of these really got to me, and reading that I should\\'ve posted this as a lifeprotip made me laugh. Most if all, it helped me confirm that it was not a FU on my part, but actually a gift that it happened so early. Thank you all, so much! Going to read through and respond to as many as I can.\\n\\nEdit 2: I know that this post was meant to be posted in another sub, but thank you for being kind, and not focusing in on that aspect haha This fuck up started 6 years ago when I met my wife’s parents for the first time. Thought I had been determined to make a great first impression, ma and pa weren’t thrilled about their country girl being stolen away from them by a city boy. \\n\\nConversation was stiffer than John Mayer’s penis at 4 am on a friday night, but somehow it veered into the French category. I think we were talking about the civil war. Ma stated she’d always wanted to learn the language. I thought I’d win her over by telling a joke: \\n\\n”A few years ago I didn’t speak any french, but now I can speak fluently - apparently it is parler liquide”\\n\\nWell, they didn’t quite catch my wit, apperently speaking neither french nor sarcasm. Before this, they’d been cold to me at best, but now they were treating me like I was the queen of france - before the revolution. At first, I thought they simply loved my joke. Ooh-ing and aah-ing. Asking me to speak more french. Weird, I thought, since the joke wasn’t that funny, but maybe it was their cup of tea? Glass of wine? Jokes about french maybe was their thing. I proceeded to recite the only other french joke I know:\\n\\nA cat named 1-2-3 and another one named un, deux, trois were crossing a river. One made it avross. Which one? 1, 2, 3 because un, deux, trois, **cat**-re sinq. \\n They loved that one too. Looking back on it, they didn’t understand it at all. \\n\\nWhen they started asking me about where I learn it, how long it took, if I’d be willing to teach them, it dawned on me. It being the first time meeting my wife’s family, me fearing the awkward, and her dad looking like he chops trees with his bare hands, I made the split second decision to lie. \\n\\nAnd lied I have these past 6 years. My relationship with my wife’s parents has grown steady. I’ve spent far more time with them than I ever anticipated. I would have been comfortable coming clean to them, had it not been for the fact that the frenchness is my entire identity, my being, my worth to them now. I have become a caricature. Fearing they’d suspect otherwise, I way overdid it early on which means I’ve had to keep it up at express pace this entire time. My wife thinks it’s hilarious, which is why she hasn’t said anything, and the lie has gone on far too long for me to say anything. Every christmas the family gets together and I gift them french wines, despite never having been there. I sometimes say ’merde’ after intentionally dropping something infront of them and I even learned how to make baguettes. I occasionally wear a beret and they love me for it.\\n\\nSo much so that they decided to invite the entire family to Paris for their 30th anniversary next year (after the pandemic). They’re so excited and they’re talking about how I can translate for them and ”take them places only locals would know off” and how I’ve ”inspired them to finally visit France”. My wife’s parents are no wealthy people, it is a grand gesture from them paying for my vacation to Europe. I know I’ve got to tell them. I can’t back out of it, my wife would kill me. And I can’t wait for them to find out in France, my wife would kill me. \\n\\nIt’s so frustrating because it’s such a small fuck up that has built up to this tremendous thing over the past few years. I have no idea what will happen once they know, but I’m not eager to find out. \\n\\nTL;DR: Wife’s parents didn’t understand a joke, thought I spoke french. Me being afraid of awkwardness, doubled down and became über-french despite speaking no french at all. Now they’re taking me to real french people and I am screwed. Obligatory - not today. This was about 10 years ago. \\n\\n\\nI started doing stand up when I was in the army - in Afghanistan, actually. I started telling stories around the fire at night, but eventually started doing \"shows\" in the chow hall or during talent shows if we were on a bigger base at the time. It wasn\\'t uncommon for me to do so badly that I lost people during these shows; I even had a platoon opt to go on patrol early rather than watch my whole set. I was less fun than possibly dying. \\n\\nI wanted to get better, so I ordered a book and started working on trying to improve crowd work (talking to the audience) and being more physical. I figured if I could make the interpreters laugh with the language barrier, I\\'d be on my way to being a better comic. \\n\\nDuring our next patrol, we detained several suspected Taliban fighters. We needed to keep them on our base until they could get picked up by Intel people, so we needed to watch them for 2 days. I thought the idea of a literal captive audience was too good to pass up and basically tried to do crowd work and run bits by them in an incredibly animated manner. Imagine Sebastian Maniscalco, but 2 months into comedy. I volunteered for as many guard duty shifts as I could. I\\'d try jokes, I\\'d ask for their names and where they were from, jobs, e.t.c. anything I could try to make a joke about. Never a single laugh. \\n\\nEventually, they got picked up and apparently one complained about my jokes specifically. I ended up getting a stern talking to for \"unconventional interrogation\" because I kept asking where they were from and what they did and had to explain that I was so bored and desperate to get better at comedy that I almost inadvertently committed a war crime. \\n\\nTL;DR: I performed stand up comedy for detained Taliban members that went so badly they accused me of war crimes. Got a stern talking to for that. Obligatory wasn\\'t today, this happened a couple months back. My brother and I have always had a long-standing agreement that in the event of hospitalization, the other one would try to convince the hospitalized - by any means necessary - that the world ended (coming from the idea of waking up from a coma to find out you slept through the apocalypse, etc). This agreement was about 14/15 years ago, but we reference it quite often, so I was convinced he still remembered.\\n\\nA couple months back, my brother was admitted to the hospital initially for intense stomach pains but eventually found what my dad describes as \"an absolute fuck ton of kidney stones\". Eventually he got out, but the stents he had to pull through his urethra snapped, and he was admitted again. I got home this time because my mom made it sound far worse than it actually was. I decided to take this opportunity to enact our agreement. \\n\\nNear the hospital is a really run down quarry-looking place. There\\'s a bunch of rusted old metal shit everywhere, and a really ominous little cement shack which, to this day, no one in town really knows what it\\'s for. So I went out and filmed a video basically along the lines of \"[brother\\'s name], if you\\'re watching this, I\\'m already dead. Everyone on the world pretty much is. It\\'s been about eight months since you went to [hospital name]. You need to head for the safe haven in Helsinki (we live in western Canada) - mom might be there. God speed.\" I managed to sync it up to the TV and woke him up as it was starting.\\n\\nThis is where it all goes to complete shit. My brother began to lose it immediately. He started freaking out, screaming, basically got up, put on his clothes, and noped out into the hallway. I grabbed him to calm him down, which he eventually did. Nurses came in and I was ejected from the hospital for causing a disturbance (rightfully so).\\n\\nHe got out a couple days later, and we\\'ve been laughing about it ever since. My mom won\\'t talk to me and told me to just fuck off back home. My dad thinks it\\'s funny but won\\'t laugh about it in front of my mom. I\\'m no longer welcome at a hospital unless it\\'s an emergency. I\\'ve also been kicked out of a family vacation.\\n\\nWorth the wait though.\\n\\ntl;dr: Convinced my hospitalized brother the world ended via video, pissed off my mom and got banned from a hospital\\n\\nEDIT: Wow this blew up?! I don\\'t have a ton of time but:\\n\\n1) I don\\'t want to upload the video. I made it sound tamer than it was, I look, sound, and say completely batshit stuff on this video and definitely don\\'t want to be associated with it xD\\n\\n2) The TVs in the hospital had HDMI ports. I just plugged it into my Chromebook. \\n\\n3) I can see why people say I made this up for karma, but I didn\\'t create a throwaway to do that.  If I cared that much, I would\\'ve posted it on my main account.\\n\\n4) My mom has a genetic tendency to overreact. She hasn\\'t been happy with me moving (western Canada to the maritimes, bitching about abandoning the family, etc), so this was probably going to happen regardless. She paid for it though and can\\'t get a refund for my ticket so it\\'s not my problem. Obligatory \"this didn\\'t happen today\".  Well, actually I guess it\\'s happening right now.\\n\\nToday is the Internet Wide Day of Action to Save Net Neutrality, and /r/TIFU is participating.  We support a free and open Internet, so today we have restricted the submissions to this subreddit to give you a feel of what it might look like if net neutrality is ended.\\n\\nHere are some links for further reading about net neutrality:\\n\\nhttps://www.battleforthenet.com/july12/\\n\\nhttps://www.fightforthefuture.org/\\n\\nELI5:  https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2443jw/eli5_what_is_net_neutrality_and_why_is_it_so/\\n\\nELI5:  https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/1v75up/eli5_us_appeals_court_kills_net_neutrality_how/\\n\\nVideo:  https://youtu.be/l6UZUhRdD6U\\n\\nIf you live in the US, you can contact your government representatives here:\\n\\nhttps://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/\\n\\nhttp://www.house.gov/representatives/find/\\n\\nYou can also contact your state\\'s Public Utilities Commission:\\n\\nhttps://www.google.com/#q=public+utilities+commission So this actually happened yesterday, and I\\'m still shaken up over it. My boyfriend and I decided to visit Zapata Falls in Colorado after taking a social distance Covid style road trip. We saw the waterfall and it was magnificent. There were tons of people (few of whom wore masks) so we ventured in a side direction. I noticed a very climb-able ridge and trying to be spontaneous I began to climb. Well, after a few minutes I was having trouble finding my footing and looked down to see it would be near impossible to descend. Cue the panicked calls for the boyfriend, who came up after me and told me we needed to get to the top since it would be safer. I\\'ll note at this point it looked like the top wasn\\'t too far off. Spoiler: we were wrong.\\n\\nAs we began our ascent I tried not to look down or up as it became apparent this wasnt just a small ledge that would lead to the top of the fall. Nope, we were free climbing a mountain.\\n\\nAfter about half an hour I was panicked. My feet slid at every attempt upwards and I heard the loose rocks I disturbed tumble off. We called 911 from a small flat ledge where we could sit down. The operator was great and told us if we weren\\'t hurt and could make it to the top, there was a trail. That was encouraging enough to press on. In time we came to the top. I clung to the jagged rock as wind raced past while my boyfriend looked for the path. We began to spiral down the mountain, walking diagonally still looking for this trail. Long story short, we never found the trail and we spent hours slowly getting to the bottom. At one point the ground slid and I skinned my leg on a tree trunk, but all things considered we made it down with minimal injuries. \\n\\nFrom there we walked towards the sound of water and soon voices came into the mix, distant but clear. Thankfully we pinned where we parked and used a compass and map of the location to get us to safety. I cried like a baby when we got to the car. Today I woke up feeling sore in every fiber of my being but super grateful to be alive.\\n\\nTl;dr: Thought I was climbing a path to see the top of a waterfall, ended up free climbing a mountain and spent 6+ hours trying to navigate out of that situation. Special thanks to TJ the 911 operator who calmed me down enough to make it to the top without incurring an expensive helicopter rescue fee.\\n\\nEdit 1: I am BLOWN AWAY by how this has taken off. I\\'m still en route but wanted to note a few things. 1. I have read comments that clarified I did not free climb but instead free soloed. I know nothing of climbing (clearly) and am grateful for the education. I\\'m leaving it just to further show my climbing ignorance. 2. Regarding that ignorance... I fully agree this was a dumbass thing to do. I should have stayed on the trail. I endangered myself, my boyfriend and any possible SAR that would need to save my tourist ass. I am not normally this person and I will act accordingly in the future. 3. For those who are posting kind words and encouragement thank you. I fully acknowledge that I fucked up and am trying to make the best of it. I did learn a lesson and ultimately I am trying to be gentle with myself as we all make mistakes. Thank you for your empathy. \\n\\nEdit 2: I got in late last night but uploaded a video of the initial climb (super grainy don\\'t know why) and a drawn route. In the video we thought that tall rock ahead was the top. It was not. Thank you to all the people who did remind me to stay on the trail out of respect for the park, myself and others. I wholeheartedly agree. Without further ado... Accidental Mountain Climb https://imgur.com/gallery/NK30iuC Yesterday I ate the ends of a chicken wing. Someone told me the ends were crunchy, like pork crackling, so I tried it out. I never expected this to happen. \\n\\nI must not have chewed one properly. I got something lodged in my throat. To dislodge it I ate some bread and drank some softdrink. Some pain persisted but I went to sleep last night hoping it\\'d be fine in the morning. \\n\\nThis morning I woke with tremendous pain in my throat and chest. I walked to the public hospital down the road because I was starting to worry. \\n\\nThe GP noticed I had a \"crunchy throat\" when pressing on it. He immediately sent me off to get an Xray. That showed I have a perforated esophagus. That is, the tube from my mouth to my stomach has been punctured. The \"crunchy\" feeling was air that had shifted into parts of my neck it shouldn\\'t be. \\n\\nTo get more information I started reading a journal on the condition and how to treat it. \\n\\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3219576/\\n\\nThey consider it a critical medical condition with a 20% chance of mortality. It\\'s so rare that its incedent rate is 3.1/1 million people. A few random doctors even asked if they could feel my neck to experience the crunchy feeling. They said they\\'d read about it in textbooks, but you never see it. \\n\\nNow I\\'m waiting on the results of the CT Scan which will determine whether I get surgery or just have to fast for a few days while my body fixes it. If I\\'d waited over 24hrs there would be a much higher risk. \\n\\nTL;DR: I ate the ends off a chicken wing and now I\\'m in hospital with a critical condition with a 20% mortality rate.\\n\\n**Update:** A surgeon just spoke to me. I have to be nil-by-mouth for 7 days to help my body heal the holes in the throat and chest areas of my esophagus. They don\\'t expect me to need surgery so that\\'s a plus.\\n\\n**Update 2:** The main surgeon just spoke to me. I\\'ll be here at least 7 days, even if the pain goes away. The critical problem is non-sterile air has passed through the hole and entered a vulnerable area that must be sterile. So I can\\'t eat or drink to reduce the risk of that area getting infected and I need to wait until the air is absorbed by the tissue.\\n\\n**Update 3:** I had a tube pushed into my arm, through a vein, all the way to the top of my heart. It\\'s called a PICC. It\\'s how I\\'ll be eating and drinking over the next week.\\n\\n**Update 4:** I\\'m out now and everything seems to be fine! I have another check up on the 11th of December to confirm. Okay so you\\'re probably wondering what the fuck that title is. \\n\\nNot more than 30 minutes ago I received a new match on Tinder (yay!). She was cute so I sent her a message saying hi and we talked for a bit and then I got her snap.\\n\\nOn Snapchat she asks if I wanted to play truth or dare and being the horndog that I am I agreed. The questions were innocent enough at first, but then I dared her to send her most recent picture in her camera roll. It was her cleavage (score). In that moment I knew I had succeeded in my dick\\'s desire. I picked dare next because she picked dare. Her dare was to put toothpaste on my dick.\\n\\nNow, I\\'m not proud of this but I wasn\\'t super against it at first. I called her out for just trying to see my dick by putting a funny spin on it. I decided to video call her on Snapchat and she watched me pull out my dick and such. I then said that was enough and I didn\\'t wan\\'t to rub toothpaste on my dick but she insisted she would send nudes if I did.\\n\\nSo, I squeezed out some toothpaste, rubbed that bad boy on my cock, and sent a pic to the girl. Not two seconds later I check and she unadded me on snap and unmatched with me on Tinder.\\n\\nHoes really be out here getting guys to rub toothpaste on their dicks and leave. Now I\\'m stuck with a stinging cock and some blue balls.\\n\\nTLDR: Rubbed toothpaste on my dick and sent it to a girl for a dare and she ghosted me TL;DR I was holding on to a lot of trauma, and the emotion came pouring out.\\n\\nShe had pre-eclampsia, which is not totally rare. But she only exhibited a headache and none of the other features until her blood pressure shot through the roof. He was born shortly after we were admitted to the hospital and while it was the happiest day of my life I haven’t really had the chance to fully deal with the trauma of walking into a hospital thinking my pregnant wife would get a shot to quell a headache, only to haven’t to confront the reality of possibly walking out alone. I chose not to focus on any of that. Instead, I put my head down and concentrated on the things we could control.\\n\\nHe was in the NICU for several weeks and everyday we had to be strong parents for our son fighting for his life. And of course, once he graduated from the NICU we suddenly had a baby to turn into a full-grown human.\\n\\nThe lack of sleep is real. Plus, post-partum and the grief of not experiencing the full-term has been very difficult for my wife. Meanwhile, I’m a freelance artist who has been getting a lot of work recently after a VERY dry few months. Basically, I’ve had absolutely no time to slow down and think about everything.\\n\\nThis was a transcontinental flight. He was marvelous. Slept almost the whole way, even after our flight was delayed for 7 hours and we spent the entire day at the airport. My wife had held him most of the flight while I caught up on some work. But when her back was aching I took him and I looked for something to watch. I didn’t want anything too stressful and I thought, “Finding Nemo has that Thomas Newman score and the blue and orange will be soothing.” I had completely forgotten about the beginning. Really, really dumb.\\n\\nBut I couldn’t turn it off. Even as the snot out-volumed the tears. In a sense, it was like an ice bath—at first, it stabbed me like a thousand knives but once I relaxed and let it wash over me, I felt that part of me begin to heal.\\n\\nWe’re both starting therapy because we have a man to make and we can’t be good parents without being ones who are as healthy as possible. This is just the beginning as a parent. But, I can’t help but think that maybe ‘Finding Nemo’ helped me figure out just how much I’d been holding inside. Which, is coincidentally kinda the whole point of the film: letting go.\\n\\nEDIT: I just woke up and when I sat down to feed him his morning bottle I realized my phone was going crazy. This is crazy. I can’t believe how much this has blown up! Thank you everyone for your words of encouragement. I cannot adequately express how much that means to us.\\n\\nAlso, to answer a little bit of a fair question, this is a FU because I didn’t really choose the right venue for this, or stop to think that Pixar is pretty much synonymous with sobbing. Planes already heighten our insecurities so choosing a film that will surely make me cry in that environment was not a great choice. I had the most vivid sex dream the other day. The kinda dream no one would want to wake up from. I was one of the founding members of the X-Men, and I was balls deep in mutant pussy. So, fucking was literally my superpower. I could cure the sick with my cum. Humans and mutants alike flocked to my cock. Including the members of the X-Men. So, in this dream, I was fucking Blink and Jubilee. Sparks were flying in the bedroom. I mean, damn. I never really gave a fuck about these characters in real life. But deep down in dreamland, I gave *all* the fucks. I experienced the most explosive orgasm. I woke up at that moment.\\n\\nOof. I was in the gawd damn plane that time with a string of saliva drooling down my chin, a visible buldge, and jizz stains seeping through my pants. I\\'m not hung like a horse or some shit, but boners are fucking hard to hide sometimes. Especially if you\\'re wearing loose pants. I locked eyes with the passenger next to me. She wasted no time handing me one of her pillows to place over my penis. It had the words \"Best Mom Ever\" on the pillow case. *Of course it had*. At that point I realized life was pulling out all the fucking stops. I was too embarrassed to really speak, but I managed to squeeze out an awkward thank you to the passenger. She shook her head as if to say \"don\\'t mention it\". And then she said this fucking shit: \\n\\n\"Don\\'t worry, you\\'ve said enough in your sleep\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry?\"\\n\\n\"I have a son who\\'s also into X-Men\"\\n\\n**Words that will haunt me for the rest of my days.** \\n\\n*Edit: Appreciate the Silver & Gold! Last time I checked I had like 5 comments and 3 upvotes. This, I did not see coming. Thanks for all the responses, from the believers to the none believers, you\\'re all equally entertaining! For those of you asking for photos of the pillow, once I got off the plane, I snatched my bags and rushed to the nearest bathroom, where I changed pants. Once I did that, I tossed the pillow in the trash. An Uber was waiting to take me straight to my new job. No fucking way was I gonna bring a \"best mom ever\" pillow into the new office. This fuck up needs no sequel.*\\n\\n*TL;DR I came on a plane with the utmost shame.* I don’t live in the US so my native language isn’t English. There are some guys from USA who I talk to while playing GTA on PS.\\n\\nSo we were talking, when suddenly one of the guys’ brother came to his room and hit him (not hard tho, you know, brothers) to make him die in the game. It was kinda funny and we were laughing at him and he was laughing too.\\n\\nWhile everybody were laughing I wanted to say that my brother does it to me too sometimes, so I said like “haha my brother also beats me off sometimes”.\\n\\nSo apparently “to beat off” does not mean the same as “to beat”, as you might know. \\n\\nEverybody went silent and I didn’t understand why. Then one of the guys understood what I meant and said “do you even know what beat off means?” and I was like “the same as to hit..?”.\\n\\nSo everybody were laughing hard and he explained to me what it actually means. I was embarrassed as fuck and didn’t talk much after it... I feel a little insecure now to talk to them as my English might not be good enough.\\n\\nTL;DR I thought that “to beat off” is the same as “to beat” and the guys were laughing at me\\n\\nEdit: Oh my god, just woke up to this. Thank you guys for the love and awards! This happened approximately six years ago, I was laughing about it with my friend today, who recommend that I post it here. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo, flashback to undergrad, things are good and I just started dating this beautiful girl that I had met in class. I was enamored with her, shocked that I loved her so fast, and amazed that she even wanted to date me. The first months are amazing, we can\\'t keep our hands off each other and never seem to be sick of the others company. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAfter a few months into our relationship, I started to notice some concerning symptoms. As you can probably hypothesize, when I pee\\'d, it burned. At first, I just assumed it must have been something weird with my diet, to be sure, I decided to stop taking creatine just in case. But, as time went on (a few days later), the burning became unbearable. I would literally be struggling to stand while I pee\\'d because the pain was so intense. After, I would literally lay in my bed in the fetal position until the pain subsided. It was bad. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWell, at this point, I was no longer convinced that my diet was causing the symptoms. No, it had to be what I thought unfathomable, my girlfriend must have cheated on me. I hadn\\'t been with anyone else. I hadn\\'t been with anyone else since I began pursuing her, months before we became exclusive. I was shocked. Things seemed so perfect, she seems like such a good person, where had I gone wrong? The thought made my blood boil, until I outright confronted her. I told her I knew she must have been unfaithful because of my symptoms, and asked her if she had similar symptoms. She told me no. I demanded that she come with me to a clinic, that we both take a test, and share our results. She said sure. (looking back at this I feel like a complete dick). We agreed that we would go the next day.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe same night I confronted my girlfriend, my roommates girlfriend came over to stay at our place. She was being nice and went to do some dishes for us. Around this time my roommates and I had just moved into a new house. In the process all our belongings got shuffled around. As she went to get some dish washing pods, she exclaimed \"why are you guys washing your dishes with laundry detergent!?!?!\" I heard that and it all clicked, holy shit, I\\'ve been pissing out bleach?!?! I instantly felt ashamed and immediately apologized to my girlfriend. She took it really well, laughed at the situation, and we forgot about it. Sure enough, a few days later, after our dishes/cups were no longer saturated with bleach residue, my symptoms disappeared. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR - Months into a new relationship it began to intensely burn when I pee\\'d. I told my girlfriend I knew she cheated on me and demanded she go with me to take an STD test. The night before we went, I inadvertently discovered that I had been consuming bleach, causing my symptoms, because my roommates were using laundry detergent pods instead of dish washing soap.  A few weeks ago I flew out to Fresno to visit my younger sister and her family since I havent seen them in 4 years. The first night in town was wonderful and wholesome. They gave me a quick tour of the local sights and we ended up at a local restaurant for a family dinner. The conversation was mostly about family stuff and how the boys were doing in school. The older son ,\"Alec\", was enjoying thus far his senior year at HS and enjoyed a healthy social life dating often. On the other hand is my nephew \"Dan\" who does very well academically but has zero game with the ladies. When I pressed him as to why, he admitted he had a hard time approaching them and mostly stuttered and blushed. Alec chimmed in with the fact his brother seemed to fancy more \"robust\" girls which sent the table laughing with the exception of my sister and Dan. Being the cool uncle I let the matter drop until my sister excused herself to use the ladies room. As she walked away l leaned over and offered a bit of advice from my Marine Corps days. If he liked big then he needed to go to a place where big is not judged. But dont go empty handed. I suggested finding a clothing store that accomodates plus sizes and bring along some snacks as an ice breaker. Now that I think of it I was about 4 coctails into the evening and the snickering coming from my brother in law and nephew should have been an omen of sorts. So the topic dropped after sis returned and that was pretry much my first evening.\\n A few days later it occured to all of us Dan was leaving the house early in the day and was returning much later at night in uncommonly good moods. When his mother inquired he explained about gaming with the friends and so on. I however was not buying it. I pulled him aside and got the truth. The boy explained after some trial and error there was a strip mall in town that had both a chicken shack as well as a reputable plus sized womens clothing store. He would buy a bucket of chicken tenders and eat on the hood of his car chatting up women as they walked by. He met a girl and they had been seeing each other. I was happy I could help and could not believe it actually worked. However things went south. \\n A few days after my return to the east coast I received a very emotional call from my sister. She explained between curses lobbed at me she had went clothing shopping one day and when she went to enter the store there was a \"Have you seen this man\" flier on the door. It was a grainy surveillance photo of Dan sitting on the hood of his car with a bucket of chicken and a two litre of soda. The flier warned of a man/youth approaching women as they tried to shop and though he had been warned off he still may be a threat. When she confronted the boy he rolled on me and his father played ignorant. Now Dan is grounded until the threat of restraining orders die down and I told I am not invited for Christmas. Poor Dan cant go out to see his new girlfriend and blames me for that as well.\\n\\nTL;DR.  I royally fucked up by telling my 17 year old nephew to meet big girls by hanging out in front of womens plus sized stores with food causing him to be forever grounded and causing  possible restraining orders, as well as me no longer invited to my sisters. So I\\'m at work it\\'s about twelve pm today... I get the urge to shit real bad, maybe it was the hot sauce on my eggs this morning, IDK. I race walk on down to the men\\'s shit house, I arrive finally, push open the door and head for the most private stall in the back because I had a feeling this one was gonna be quite loud. Upon getting to the door of the stall I noticed that the latch was sort of in between locked and open. I didn\\'t think it would be wise to just open the door because it may well be occupied so I took a couple steps back to look under the stall to see if there were somebody\\'s shoes in there that would tell me if it was indeed occupied....\\n\\nTwo things happened. As I bent down far enough to see under the stall, the occupant was looking under the stall right back at me...awkward...really really awkward. And given the urgency of the situation, the pressure of my leather belt against my lower abdomen caused me to fart, real loud, at that exact moment. I don\\'t know if there are words to describe what seemed like an eternity when we both locked eyes with a loud, slow motion fart going off in the back ground was like. Wanting to laugh but afraid it would cause me to shit my pants, I waddled to an open stall and let \\'er rip.\\n\\nTL;DR TIFU by waiting too long to head to the restroom, looking under a stall just to see someone staring back at me and I farted real loud at the same time because I had to take a crap so bad. I\\'ll admit I haven\\'t been the most attentive husband lately. My wife has told me I need to make more of an effort in our relationship or we would have problems. I\\'ve tried really hard to invest in our relationship ever since finding out my wife is not feeling as happy as she\\xa0should be.\\n\\nThis fuck up happened last week. My wife\\'s birthday\\xa0was coming up. I decided to go big. My wife absolutely loves surprises so I decided to\\xa0surprise\\xa0her with a romantic night and lots of flowers and presents. She had to go to work in the morning of her birthday and I had the day off. A lot of time to plan everything out.\\n\\nI decided, being the idiot I am, to pretend that I had forgotten\\xa0my wife\\'s birthday\\xa0just to make the surprise, well, even more of a surprise. The plan was as follows: my wife wakes up and I don\\'t mention her birthday. She thinks I\\'ve forgotten it. She goes to work and I get everything ready. She comes home in the evening after work and\\xa0tadaa!!\\xa0When she opens the door I\\'ll be waiting for her with gifts, flowers dinner and everything romantic I could think of. Sounds like an amazing plan right? WRONG.\\n\\nNothing special happened in the morning and my wife left for work while I slept in. During the day I got everything\\xa0ready\\xa0and apart from mildly messing up the\\xa0desert\\xa0everything went great. Then it was time to wait for my wife to return. She\\xa0was supposed\\xa0to get home after 4pm. 4.30pm nothing. 5pm still nothing. I was starting to get worried and I texted her where she was. Around 5.30pm she read my message but didn\\'t reply. I called her and she didn\\'t answer. I was starting to get extremely worried and texted her if she was okay.\\xa0Thats\\xa0when she replied.\\n\\nShe texted me opening up about how she couldn\\'t believe I had forgotten her birthday even after her expressing to me how she had felt neglected in the relationship and wanting me to put in more effort. I, in all my stupidity, still decided to play dumb to make my big surprise work. I told her to just get home so we could talk about it. Big mistake\\n\\nShe told me she\\xa0was done\\xa0talking and started mentioning divorce. Fuck\\xa0fuck fuck.\\xa0Thats\\xa0when I called her and she still wouldn\\'t answer. Then I panicked and started explaining everything to her by text. I took pictures of all the things I had done around the house, the gifts the flowers the decorations the dinner everything. I just wanted to surprise her that\\'s all I wanted.\\n\\nI tried calling her to no avail. She read my messages and after not getting a reply I just broke and started crying. After what felt like the longest wait of my life my wife comes home. She\\'s crying saying she\\'s sorry. I told her it was my fault and we both just cried holding each other. We spent the night crying and cuddling and eating the dinner I made. She told me it was the best thing she had ever eaten (obviously a lie, it was mediocre at best and already cold). It wasn\\'t the surprise I had hoped to give her, I\\'m just glad to still be married to her.\\n\\nAnd yes we are working to fix our relationship. I love this woman with all my heart. I had her permission to share this\\n\\nTldr: Wanted to surprise my wife for her birthday and pretented to forget her birthday to make the surprise better. She got really upset and started talking about a divorce. I ruined the surprise trying to explain myself and we spent the night of her birthday crying and cuddling.\\n\\nEdit: Wow thank you for the kind words everyone! I can\\'t reply to everyone so I just wanted to say I appreciate it here!\\n\\nFor all the concerned people, yes we are getting help and fixing things like I have stated before. I appreciate the concern but with all\\xa0due\\xa0respect I\\'m going to take relationship advice from\\xa0professionals and\\xa0not from\\xa0reddit. It\\'s weird to have people arguing about my relationship when frankly no one knows us or the situation we are in. I just wanted to share this\\xa0story\\xa0on here with my wife since we already talked this issue through. Still, reading your personal experiences and what you have gone through is helpful so please do share if you feel like doing so!\\n\\nAnd to the\\xa0people\\xa0messaging me calling my wife horrible things I\\xa0sincerely\\xa0want to say, fuck you. Calling me an idiot\\xa0is justified, calling my wife horrible is not.\\xa0\\n\\nEdit2: I\\'m getting so many comments about this that I\\'ve decided to\\xa0address\\xa0it here. I commented this before but I\\'m going to put it here too so people can see it better hopefully. Like some have said I wasn\\'t really thinking about her when doing what I did, I made\\xa0the whole\\xa0surprise essentially about myself even though I didn\\'t mean to. It was never my intention to make her feel bad even though I now realize that\\xa0of course\\xa0she would feel horrible for\\xa0the whole\\xa0day after I pretended to not remember her birthday. I\\'ve apologized for this and these things\\xa0were talked\\xa0about.\\n\\nReally the only thing I was thinking was about wanting to surprise my wife and not about how my way of going about it was going to make her feel. My dumb logic was that hey, my wife loves\\xa0surprises\\xa0so I have to make the\\xa0surprise\\xa0as\\xa0suprising\\xa0as I can, any way I can. I never intended to make her feel bad but my lack of thinking made that happen and I feel horrible for it. I was replying to a Redditor on another sub about why diamonds are actually extremely common and why they\\'re essentially worthless. I was on FaceTime with my girlfriend and she noticed I was typing a lot and asked me what I was writing.\\n\\nI start telling her about diamonds, how they\\'re formed, where they come from and so on. My mind begins to get sidetracked as it always does, and I talk about the different types of stars and how they \"die\" and what the fate of our Sun will be. As she starts to worry about the end of life in our solar system, i get sidetracked again and try to reassure her that we don\\'t have to worry about the Sun swallowing Earth in its outer shell as a Red giant because our neighbouring galaxy Andromeda will already be merged with our galaxy, making it impossible for us to be have a home here anyways. \\n\\nAs my girlfriend digests this information, she starts to think of how humanity may end completely and how life, and our existence is basically meaningless which sends her into a panic attack, causing her to freeze up, have difficulty breathing, and start crying for about five minutes straight.\\n\\nNow I\\'m here, typing this up and trying to get her to relax at the same time by explaining how we are a relatively young species and have a long time to figure out a game plan, though I\\'m not sure if any of it is really helping.\\n\\nTL;DR I told my girlfriend the sun will eventually burn out, swallowing Earth in the process and eliminating all life, causing her to have a panic attack and cry before bed. This happened 2 days ago. So last week I found a thong on the floor in my living room. Smelt it like the animal I am, was clean, and put it in my wife\\'s underwear drawer.\\n\\n2 days ago in the evening, my wife is getting ready to go take a bath, when she comes down 2 minutes later asking me where the hell does this thong come from.\\n\\nHuh... I found it on the floor, surely it felt from the laundry basket? It was clean so I put it in your drawer. What it\\'s not yours?\\n\\nAngrily, she answers it\\'s not hers. You just want me to believe it just appeared on the floor?!?\\n\\nI tell her what the hell am I suppose to say. She goes back upstairs really angry at me.\\n\\nSo last week my wife was out of town for work and a female friend of mine came take a beer with me. I send her a picture of the thong, asking if it hers. It is. We\\'re both a bit confuse as to how it ended in my living room... We came to the conclusion maybe it got stuck at whatever she was wearing that night by static electricity while it was in the dryer...\\n\\nNow the real fuck up. My wife is in the bed. I go tell her that my friend was here last week to take a beer. Just texted her and the thong is hers. The only explanation we managed to find it\\'s that it was stuck by static at her clothes.\\n\\nYOU WANT ME TO BELIEVE THAT?! THAT MAKES NO SENSE\\n\\nJesus Christ, I don\\'t even believe my explanation myself. I tell her to believe what she wants, I don\\'t fucking know how the thong appeared in my living room, that I don\\'t have anything to redeem myself. I take some clothes and go sleep at my parents\\' home.\\n\\nThe next morning she calls me. She tells me that she decided to believe in my stupid story, because the thong was indeed clean and it\\'s logical that I\\'d put it in her drawer. And if I was cheating on her, I\\'d be fucking stupid to put my mistress panties in her drawer. Asked me to come home and we laughed a lot after that.\\n\\nTLDR : Found my friend\\'s thong on the floor in my living room, put it in my wife\\'s underwear drawer. Almost lost my wife to it.\\n\\nEDIT : OMG it exploded. Thanks for the silver mystery redditors! I know a bunch of you called me a liar and a cheater, that\\'s ultimately your right! Had fun with the others that told similar stories :) And yes, I told my friend that I sniffed her panties, asked her what her fabric softener was.\\n\\nEDIT2 : The [thong](https://imgur.com/a/KtGzDeU) in question\\n\\nEDIT 3 : Wow thanks for the gold! I answered to a bunch of you, but I\\'ll not be able to keep up! There\\'s too many comments! I hope you guys have a nice day!\\n\\nEDIT4 : addressing some comments. No I don\\'t think my friend did it on purpose to have my wife divorce me so she can have me all for herself. Yes I have the right to hang out with other women and have a drink with them. My wife also has the right to hang out with other men and have a drink with them. Finally, my friend\\'s fabric softener is Fleecy. I suddenly remembered this story today. I don’t think I have ever told this story to anyone before. So here goes. \\n\\nThis happened a few years ago when I was a pre-teen. During the summer, my family and I went back to our hometown to visit my grandparents. We were short on rooms so my sister and I shared the same room the entire summer. We had separate beds, but sometimes my sister would trade blankets with me     because my blanket was thicker and warmer. \\n\\nOne day during the summer, I discovered porn. But instead of finishing the job when I watched it, I went to sleep that day without completing the experience. I woke up with wet spots on my bed and underwear the next day. \\n\\nAt the time, i was about 80% sure what came out of me wasn’t pee, so I went on google to figure out what happened. I learned that I had a wet dream. I washed my underwear and my bed sheets but for some reason I did not wash my blanket.\\n\\nWhen I went back into my room, I saw my sister had switched blankets with me and I freaked out. I didn’t say anything and just quickly left the room. I ran out of the room and googled “Can you get someone pregnant from a wet dream?” Obviously none of the results I was looking for popped out.\\n\\nI thought my life was over and I accidentally got my sister pregnant cuz she was using my blanket that had  a little bit of my ejaculation on it. The idea haunted me and I did not tell anybody because I was too scared.\\n\\nMaybe like a week after that, I finally got the courage to tell my dad that i got my sister pregnant. This was the conversation.\\n\\nMe: “Dad, remember when I accidentally peed on my bed”\\nDad: “Yea?”\\nMe: “It wasn’t pee”\\nDad: “Yea I know it wasn’t pee, you’re going through puberty, it’s perfectly normal.”\\nHe walked away. End of Conversation.\\n\\nAfter that conversation, I just decided to wait a few months to see if my sister was pregnant.\\n\\nNeedless to say, she was not pregnant. I was just a really dumb child.\\n\\nTL;DR I had a wet dream and I thought i got my sister pregnant bc she used my blanket.\\n\\nEdit: Holy shit this blew up, this is technically my first ever post. I’m glad you guys enjoyed my suffering. I also want to add that I actually didn’t learn sex-ed until 9th grade so everything I knew before was from google.\\n\\nEdit: Thanks for the awards, it almost makes up for the weeks of anxiety and stress lol So my 4 year old son liked to dance around naked after baths and while changing him. As cute as he can be, it gets old after a while, and if you\\'ve ever had a boy, you know how they can become obsessed with their peckers. I told him one night that if he didn\\'t put it away, the Pecker Snatcher would come and take it. He looked at me with some disbelief and said I was kidding him. I told him it was the truth, and that is what happened to his sister. His eyes got big and he put his pants on.\\n\\nFast forward a couple days and him and his sister have now elaborated on the story, and the Pecker Snatcher is now a man who has a basket full of peckers that he carries with him, and other elaborations on the story. All was good and well until he explained the entire mythology they created to their grandparents and teachers. Now I\\'m the weirdo. Parenting is dumb.\\n\\nTLDR: I created a fictional Pecker Snatcher so my son would put his pants on, and he and his sister elaborated on it and told other adults. Title says most of it.  I was at a tech conference today.  I like to broadcast random WiFi hotspot names to mess with people and after the recent story about the Planet Fitness  I thought it would go over well as a joke.  I mean, who hasn\\'t seen \"FBI Surveillance Van\" as a network?\\n\\n*Holy fuck.*  **Do not do this!!!**\\n\\nCops got called.  I got to spend about 45 minutes chatting with them.  They asked a lot of questions.  They had to make sure I\\'m not a threat.  I cooperated fully.  I have no doubt being a white guy at a nerd gathering probably helped.  I was told I wasn\\'t being charged.  I was, however, told to leave by the venue and not come back.\\n\\nFlash forward two hours and I go to log into my work email on my phone.  Huh.  Password failed.  Huh, again.  Ok, let\\'s not fat finger this and lock the account.  Pull out the laptop, remote into my work PC.  Go to log in.  \"Your account has been disabled. Contact your systems administrator.\"\\n\\n20 minutes later I get the text message.\\n\\n*You are being placed on paid administrative leave effective today 5/23 while the agency investigates today’s events surrounding you being removed from the <venue>. You are not to complete any work, access agency networks or report to the office during your leave. We will contact you when the investigation is complete.*\\n\\ntl;dr: Immature joke kills career, film at 11.\\n\\n**EDIT:**  Thank you for the influx of comments and messages.  Most of you are right, I am a fucking idiot.  One doesn\\'t come to r/TIFU to brag about the good shit they\\'ve done.  No matter what you say, I\\'m trying to keep up.  You\\'re helping me cope.\\n  This happened on Halloween. I imagined the evening going down more or less like this: \\n\\n1. Slip into a white robe.\\n2. Stick on a cactus crown. \\n3. Moonwalk out of the house as Jesus. \\n4. Remember never to break character. \\n5. Hop into an Uber. \\n6. Show up to celebrate Halloween with friends. \\n7. Go HAM.\\n8. Go home. \\n9. Go sleep.\\n10. Go for a job interview the next morning.\\n\\nThis is what I would\\'ve called a good night. However, after #7, things didn\\'t quite go as planned. Here\\'s how shit actually unfolded:\\n\\n8. Got shit-faced.\\n9. Drunk me turned into drunk Jesus. \\n10. Fell into my friend\\'s swimming pool and almost drowned after attempting to walk on water.\\n11. Realized wearing all white, plus water, equals everyone seeing your shriveled up shlong through your tighty whities. \\n12. Drunk dialed my religious mother in the middle of the night to tell her I\\'m proof that Jesus is fake as fuck and that I\\'m gay, gay, gay. \\n13. Unleashed an unholy amount of vomit in the Uber driver\\'s car on the way home.\\n14. Missed my job interview the following day after waking up laughably late.\\n15. Realized drunk me set the alarm on my phone two years into the fucking future.\\n\\nFor the record I apologized to my mom. We cool now.\\n\\nTL;DR Fell into a swimming pool, got all wet wearing white, exposed my cock to a crowd, roasted Jesus over the phone with my Christian mom, woke up late the next morning and missed my job interview. Yesterday evening my GF and i thought it would be nice to watch Lord of the Rings after coming home quite late. After aproximately 4 hours i was really tired and couldnt think straight anymore. She had her \"strawberry week\" so she was plugged, which I frankly didnt care too much about. We just came along the credits in the movie and i was casually stroking her ass when i realised there is a thread hanging somewhere.\\n\\nI thought its just a random thread from the blanket, you know the ones hanging from some clothes.\\n\\nI think it was muscle reflexes or something like this, my tired brain didnt think at all and i just pulled hard without realising of what i just did.\\n\\nMy girlfriend said: \" WTF are you do-\" and it was already out creating a mess everywhere until i realised what actually happened.\\n\\nAfter explaining that i thought its from the blanket, my GF couldnt stop laughing and i felt quite ashamed. Made up the bed right after and went to sleep right next to my still giggling GF.\\n\\n**TL;DR:** Accidentally \"unplugged\" my girlfriend while watching a movie creating a mess in my bed\\n\\n**Edit**: Wow my first gold and first silver! Thank you kind stranger!\\n\\n**Edit2:** And Platin! Thanks a lot guys! Obligatory it didn\\'t happen today, however I realized my idiocy today.\\n\\nI am a small game developer part-time (I also have a regular job). Since more than 1 year I have been working alone on a puzzle-platformer that I\\'ve been thinking of for 2 years.\\n\\nIt\\'s a labor of love. After about a year of hard work, I had something that I was proud of, and that I considered ready for release. It\\'s a web game and when you release a web game, what you usually do is that you put it on a game portal. Maybe you remember flash game portals where office workers were slacking off on in the 00\\'s (personally for me it was at school). Well they are still a thing except games are not made in flash anymore, but the idea is the same.\\n\\nAlso, when you are a web game dev, it\\'s very well known that russians love web games. So if you manage to have russians liking your games, you are half the way there because you will get tons of players.\\n\\nSo anyway, I was ready to release my game, a bit apprehensive of course, I managed to get my game on a couple portals including a huge russian one.\\n\\nIn Russia, my game got wrecked. Everybody hated it. My game is a 0.8/10. I\\'m not kidding, I don\\'t think there is a worse game on this portal. It felt like shit, and I was very puzzled.\\n\\nToday, I showed it to a colleague at my normal job, explaining to him that russians hated my game. I clicked fullscreen. Then I noticed it. The downvote button on that website was overlapping the restart button in the game. So people restarting a level (which happens fairly often) gave me a downvote along the way. I don\\'t know if it\\'s clear so [here is what the buttons look like](https://imgur.com/a/wu6rG9m). You can only see it when the game is fullscreen, which is why I did not notice before.\\n\\nSo here I am, a bumbling idiot. Where any scammer in his right mind would have used this trick for evil and profit, instead I tricked them into burning me to the ground.\\n\\nTL;DR: spent more than a year making a game, released it on a Russian game portal where the restart button was right under the downvote button. Everybody restarted, everybody downvoted and now I am the proud maker on the worst web game in Russia\\n\\nEDIT: wow thanks for the load of suggestion everyone! It looks like this post is blowing up, it\\'s a first time for me! I think I\\'ll try out move the buttons, then email the russian portal to explain what happened and ask them if they would reset the votes. Also since a lot of you asked for a link, my game is called [BombHopper.io](https://bombhopper.io/), if mods want me to remove this link I\\'ll gladly comply\\n\\nEDIT 2: I\\'m currently at work, so I need to go for a while but I\\'ll check back soon!\\n\\nEDIT 3: Holy shit this is crazy everyone! Now I have 21 times more upvotes on here than downvotes on the portal. And thanks for the Platinum, Gold and Silver!\\n\\nEDIT 4: I\\'m going to bed now but first I\\'d like to thank everyone who said nice things to me. I really appreciate it. I\\'m still overwhelmed by it honestly. This post made it to /r/all whooooo! I\\'ll edit again when I get the answer from the portal.\\n\\nEDIT 5: It took a lot of time to get in touch with the portal, so I forgot to edit this post with the outcome, sorry! But for the few people that still stumble upon it: now BombHopper.io is actually the best rated game on Titotu (the portal) because they were kind enough to remove all the downvotes. But they kept the upvotes! Props to them! This happened a few years ago and I was living in Zimbabwe at the time, and I was having a pretty bad day, I was going to see my auntie who lived about 400km away from me. If youre african you\\'ll understnad that this  was no small journey. So I got in my car and set off and about 3 hours into the journey i came across a Dude by the side of the road who was going in the same direction, so out of the goodness of my heart i said jump in. we go to talking and he happened to be going to exact same village as me and he knew my auntie!.\\n\\nHalf an hour passes and we\\'re making polite chit chat and reminiscing about old times in zimbabwe, when all of a sudden he tell me to pull over, so I do. he runs out of the car and starts making wretching noises, so i assume he\\'s throwing up, its dark at this point so i cant really see much, so i go check on him ( first mistake).\\nI get out and go to his side expecting him to be there but he\\'s not.....Then I here someone behind and me and before i know it im unconcious! so I wake up a couple hours later( iknow this becuase the sun was coming up at this point) without my car, clothes or wallet. so im thinking great. i look around and see im on some farmland wearing the giys clothes. SO i start walking in no particular direction and eventually come across a settlement. \\n\\nI explain to them my situation and they tell me that the nearest main road is at least a good half a days walk from where I am and they dont get many cars coming through this part but they heard one last night ( which might be our thief). I start walking in the direction they point me in and after what felt like forever i come acroos a road, so I pitch up and start waiting, ( now i know  most of you are thinking why not call someone, i had no phone with me and I dont have the best memory so I didnt know any numbers that would come in handy). after a couple of hours a car stops and lets me hitch I let him know the situaion and he says we\\'re in the complete opposite direction of my intended destination but he\\'s willing to drop me close enough to walk the rest of the way to which I thought great!\\n\\nits takes a good two days to get there and he drops me off and i say my goodbyes to my driver, I take down his number so i can repay him later on. At this point im starting to recoginise my surroundings, I walk for a few miles and as im getting closer to my aunties i can here a lots of singing and what appears to be a large crowd which i though was strange. Im about 100 feet from the house and i see my Son which again i thought was strange because he was meant to be in school at this time, but instead of running to me and hugging me as he normally does...he runs away screaming to my complete bewilderment. I get to the the gate and all of a sudden the large crowd alerted by my sons scream has stopped singing and is stood silent. my wife appears and starts to run towards me hugging and kissing me like Ive been gone for months. My auntie appears and immediately faints when she sees me.\\n\\nI still have no clue whats going on at this point and im exhausted, so we rush to get my auntie inside and I see my picture ontop of a large box that resembles a coffin sitting in the living room....\\n\\n\\nSo it turns out that the guy who robbed me and made off with my car my wallet and all my clothes was in a car crash so bad that they couldnt identify the body and because the only things they could use to identify him was  my wallet, they assumed it was me that had died in the crash. since there was no body of sorts they could arrange the funeral preety quickly and that is what I had stumbled upon.\\nMy son still has nightmares to this day and and my wife has told me never to pick up a hitch hiker ever again.\\n\\nTL;DR Got carjacked, robber died and family thought it was me, they arrange my funeral and I somehow manage to stumble upon my own funeral.\\n\\n I want to start by giving some background here. I basically live, eat, sleep and breath Amazon. I need something, straight to Amazon. I use kindle and audible daily. Want to stream music, Amazon music. Want a new movie, prime video. Run out of something randomly, \"Hey Alexa.......\" Laundry soap, toothpaste, shampoo, dog food, fish food, subscribe & save biotch. Amazon has the answers to all of life\\'s problems. So when looking for a place to store photos, I see \"prime members have free unlimited photo storage with Amazon photos\". Naturally, my next move is to take full advantage of this being a prime member. Automatically upload photos from my phone? Even better. \\n\\nRewind to September 25th, my mom\\'s birthday. I thought about her gift for a while, but when I remembered she didn\\'t have a smart TV, the answer was easy. I hop on Amazon shopping and use my Amazon credit card to purchase one FireTV stick. She was so happy she could watch Netflix on her TV now. Yay, success! Or so I thought. \\n\\nYesterday I get an email from Amazon with the subject line \"welcome to the Fire TV family\" and thought oh good, she\\'s finally setting it up, she\\'s gonna love it! Not even in the smallest darkest corner of my mind did I imagine that it would sign in to my Amazon account without even asking for a password. Surely she\\'d have to use her own account. \\n\\nFast forward to today at a family bbq, the tv was turned on to the fire stick home page and people were playing with it, using different apps, etc. Eventually it\\'s forgotten about and left to turn on its screensaver. Sitting in my mother\\'s kitchen, I glance behind me towards the tv to see a giant lit up 65\" photo of my vagina. \\n\\nI spit out my drink and everyone looks at me. I happen to be sitting in a position where the tv is behind me so every single person in my family got a glorious view of me, bright red, choking, scrambling to find the god damn remote with a horribly x rated backdrop. I\\'m not a person to just take one picture like that and call it good. I took probably 40 pictures that night for my SO to include dildos, butt plugs, the like, in all different positions to get the perfect photos that were now being displayed on my parents television for my ENTIRE FAMILY to view. I have tattoos that were visible in the pictures so there\\'s no denying this is me and no way to talk myself out of this one. \\n\\nNobody helped me. The remote was nowhere to be found so pulled the device from the tv and took it straight home with me where I\\'m currently hiding under my blanket in shame and misery. I didn\\'t give anyone a chance to say anything, I just ran away. \\n\\nThe worst part, I asked Alexa how to recover from pain and humiliation aaaaaaand \"sorry, I\\'m not sure about that.\" Fuck Amazon.\\n\\nUpdate: I promised an update but it\\'s not really worthy of its own post. I talked to my mom who assured me that it\\'s not as bad as it seems, nobody really noticed, and it\\'s just like when my cousin replied to the group text with his dirty laundry, no big deal. However, my brother says the opposite and that my mom has threatened death and dismemberment for anyone who dares mention this to me for any reason. \\n\\nI\\'m not sure how to prove that this wasn\\'t an Amazon ad, I just wrote it how I wrote it because I thought it was funny. I wish Amazon was paying me for this crap. \\n\\nI\\'m just going to laugh about it and see how it blows over. Yes I fucked up, I was a dumbass, that\\'s why I posted it here. Yes, I should have known this could happen. Call me whatever names you want, but yes, sending unsolicited nudes to each other is something me and my SO do. It\\'s fun. I don\\'t intentionally save them, but my photos were set to automatically upload on wifi. It happened. \\n\\nThanks to everyone for the awards and sharing your similar stories, they made me laugh. And thanks for checking out my cat!!!!!\\n\\nTLDR my sexy pics ended up on my mom\\'s tv at a family party. This happened a week ago, but the awkwardness is still as strong as ever. \\n\\nStress has always gotten to me pretty easily, but the last few weeks or so have really been something else. Aside from major examinations coming up, pressure to do well from my family and a severe lack of sleep (some times less than 5 hours a night), my wisdom teeth were also getting removed in a few days, which I was extremely anxious about. All together, I was having a pretty bad time coping with it all, so, being the horny teenager I am, I often find solace in my penis and its best buddy, my right arm. \\n\\nSo, upon returning after getting my teeth removed in what seemed like a dream, I lay down in my living room with my family, watching TV. I dozed off a couple of times, and was generally quite disoriented. Being both high off anaesthetics and tired is not a good combination, and after waking feeling drowsier than ever, the upcoming exams dawned on me once again (especially since I had done next to no study at the time). \\n\\nNot really caring to face the problems that troubled me, I decided to reunite the dynamic duo (that being my right arm and my beloved penis) and forget about it all. \\n\\nAnd so off I went. Except I forgot one thing.\\n\\nI was still in the living room, in full view of my entire family.\\n\\nSomehow, my gassed up, tired brain managed to convince me that I was not in fact sitting with my family by our TV, but was instead comfortably laying in bed, in my own room. \\n\\nI don’t really understand how or why it happened. A few seconds in and I began to notice the puzzled eyes that curiously seemed to be looking right  at me, with expressions that transitioned from shock at my brazen meat smashing, to anger and outrage, accompanied with intense giggling.\\n\\nI snapped out of it of course, realising the insanity of my actions, and beheld the pure, unfiltered embarrassment I put myself in. \\n\\nI’m not going to talk about what happened next, as I don’t want to relive the next few moments.\\n\\nMy father is just disappointed. He hasn’t talked to me much recently, and the long awkward silences on the drives home are not too pleasant.\\n\\nMy mother believes that we should “embrace my sexuality”, and is potentially setting up a group therapy session as I write this. \\n\\nAnd I\\'m just studying my ass off, poring through books, it’s a good excuse to be alone. I find myself hoping that none of it really happened, that maybe I was just dreaming while I was gassed up. \\n\\nBut it did happen, and boy does my life suck right now.\\n\\nTL:DR Returned from dentist gassed up, beat my meat while in front of my whole family, I now live in shame. So this happened 6 years ago. My laptop with 8 GB RAM stopped working so I showed it to a repair guy. He took the laptop, repaired it, and returned it to me after 2 days. The laptop started working again and I was really happy. However, the speed felt slower than before. Previously, I could open multiple chrom tabs and still be able to play games while they were open but now it would drop a lot of frames and my laptop would start overheating. I thought maybe it’s getting old so that’s why the performance is dropping. So I didn’t care much. \\n\\nFast forward to few days back. The same laptop stopped working again, so I called the same repair guy. He took the laptop again, repaired it and returned it to me in 2 days. This time when I started using the laptop, I could IMMEDIATELY tell something was off. The speed was RIDICULOUSLY slower than before. If opened just 2 tabs on chrome it would still overheat. I checked on YouTube for solutions and came across this video where he said to check on computer settings whether all my ram slots were functioning properly and all my ram cards were being detected. So I open computer setting and guess what I find out? It’s reading only 2 GB of RAM! How the fuck did it drop to 2 GB from 8 GB?! I thought it must be an error so I restarted the laptop multiple times and it still read 2 GB. Then I called the repair guy and asked him about this. He replied “It’s just a minor error. It will fix automatically over time. Don’t worry.” I was so confused. I didn’t believe him so I opened the laptop myself and checked the ram slots and Guess what I find? ONE OF THE RAM CARDS IS MISSING AND the RAM card that was in it was NOT the one that I got with my laptop because I remember it had a stylish border. So I looked up the card number online and found out that it was only 2 GB. I called the repair guy again and asked him about this. He said that he was also repairing another laptop and swapped ram cards by mistake and he was really sorry. So he came home the next day, swapped the ram card with my original one and was about to leave when I asked him “What about the second card?”\\n\\nRG: What card?\\nMe: The one that you stole from me years ago. \\nRG: I don’t know what you are talking about. \\nMe: This is only 4 GB RAM. Don’t try to fool me again. I’m calling the cops. \\nRG: Wait wait I’m sorry!! I think I remember now!I’ll bring it! I had forgotten about it!\\n\\nSo he brought it back and now my laptop is as fast as ever. I guess I would have never known about the stolen RAM card If I never called him again. \\n\\nTLDR; Laptop repair guy stole one of my RAM cards 6 years ago and I learned that recently. I confronted him about it and after threatening him of calling cops on him, he surrendered and returned it to me.\\n\\nUpdate 1: HOLY SHIT!!! I did not expect this post to blow up!! Thanks for all the awards! I have never got these many awards before! Speaking of the theif, I reported it to the customer service of his company. They told me they will take action against him. I will ask them again tomorrow and update it on this post.\\n\\nUpdate 2: The guy got fired from his company and got arrested! Apparently he had made over $5000 by selling stolen electronic parts from all his customers. He had stolen things like cameras and graphic cards etc. His company gave everyone of his customers a huge discount coupon in return as a token of apology. The cops are still investigating the whole chain of these scammers. I hope they get caught soon! Also I read most of the comments and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions people had:\\n\\n1. He obviously did not return the exact same RAM card to me. He must have bought the same model from one of his friends from the chain. \\n\\n2. How is this my TIFU? Well if I had investigated this the 1st time my laptop got slow 6 years ago, then I could have not only saved 6 years of slow processing of information, but also prevented others from getting scammed in that time period. \\n\\nThat fucker got arrested. It’s a shame it took him so long. The lesson we should all learn from this is to be careful with whom you give your products to and try fixing things on your own. Don’t be an idiot like me. This actually happened over Christmas last year.\\n\\nMy family, including (paternal) my grandparents, Aunt, Uncle, and cousins and 2nd cousins were having Christmas dinner. \\n\\nMy grandfather brought up that he did AncestryDNA (or was it 23and me?). I don\\'t remember the exact one, because I can barely think about it. It\\'s hard just writing this up.\\n\\nIt was really cool to hear what he found. He found mostly Scandinavian spread out over the British isles, particularly Wales. We knew this part already, but then it was discovered he\\'s 3% Persian! Very small, and probably doesn\\'t mean much really, but cool nonetheless. He\\'s a huge genealogy guy, so he\\'s been working on his lineage. \\n\\nThe only ancestor he\\'s mentioned that makes me question the validity of his findings is that we\\'re a direct but illegitimate descendant of King George III. The reason why I question this is King George III is recorded as one of the few Kings who never had a mistress. \\n\\nHowever, he believes it because there\\'s a diary passed down our family from the brother of this woman who supposedly was a mistress of King George III (we are descended from the woman). He mentions traditions and the honor, etc etc etc.\\n\\nANYWAY, off topic. I thought it was fascinating, and I love hearing what he\\'s found. I brought up possibly using my Christmas money (we get money from them instead of gifts) to get one of these kits. I don\\'t think I was really going to do it, I usually use the money to pay bills.\\n\\nSilence. And it was that thick, uncomfortable silence. Everyone but me, my sister, our husbands and parents left the table.\\n\\nMy sister and I look at each other quietly, wondering who\\'s the half sibling. My parents haven\\'t said anything yet, and trust me, this is a complete surprise that it would even be an issue. We look like our parents, the only thing that\\'s different is my eyes. I have weird Hazel eyes that can shift from bright green to a weird shade of blue with an amber ring around the iris in light or because of the outfit of the day. My sister has hazel eyes too, but hers are just a green/brown color. \\n\\nI always just figured it was one of those things where it was a recessive trait that just decided to pop up in me. I never really thought much about it unless my sister whines about how it\\'s not fair I have such cool pretty eyes. \\n\\nWell, okay.\\n\\nDad starts first. Dad (D), Mom (M), Sister (S), and Me.\\n\\nD: There\\'s a chance 3ar3ara_G0rd0n, that you\\'re not my daughter.\\n\\nS and Me: Imagine that wide-eyed stunned look. My sister grabs my hand (I love her big sister ways).\\n\\nMe: Okay, um... \\n\\nD: Your mom never had an affair. This isn\\'t some cheating story.\\n\\nMe: Wha.. (I start to feel very sick).\\n\\nM: I hoped to never have to tell you this. I was raped. The reason we\\'re not sure is because your dad and I had sex earlier that day.\\n\\nMe: (I want to die, I start crying). Everyone else knows though, if they left the table.\\n\\nD: Your grandparents know.\\n\\nS: Okay, well, the guy is in jail, right?\\n\\nM: No, they wouldn\\'t move forward with the case. \\n\\nMe: He\\'s still out there?\\n\\nS: But obviously we\\'re far away from this guy, right?\\n\\nMy dad and mom look at each other. \\n\\nM: It was my brother.\\n\\nI felt so sick. I felt... dirty. I had to run to the bathroom to throw up. I couldn\\'t stop shaking. My sister came into the bathroom with me and we just cried. We probably should have been with my mom then too, but we weren\\'t thinking.\\n\\nOur husbands were just stunned and quiet.\\n\\nThe rest of the vacation was just weird. If it weren\\'t for my nephews, I\\'m pretty sure I would have just gone home.\\n\\nOh my nephews are wonderful.\\n\\nWell, we came home, and I had to battle with the \"Do I want to know?\" thoughts. I could get a DNA test. But I couldn\\'t do that to my parents if it came out... wrong. But it weighed on me too much. I had to know in order to move forward. So I asked my dad if he would submit his DNA with mine. We weren\\'t going to tell my mother if it wasn\\'t the outcome we wanted to save her the grief. It was hard asking him to not say anything to her. He should be able to talk to his wife.\\n\\nSo we submitted the test. \\n\\nI am my father\\'s daughter. I cried when I got the results. It was a huge weight off my shoulders.\\n\\nI made a decision not to tell my dad - I wanted to surprise them. I kept saying I hadn\\'t gotten the results back. I did tell my sister though.\\n\\nI gave them the piece of paper on Mother\\'s Day. I was going to wait until Father\\'s Day, but I couldn\\'t. So I got a blank card. \\n\\nInside I wrote: \"Mom, Open the paper.\" She opened it and I had written Happy Mother\\'s Day, and Happy Early Father\\'s Day. \\n\\nLots of hugs and tears that day, yah? \\n\\nThank God.\\n\\nEDIT: left out half a sentence, oops. \\n\\nIt was my uncle on my mother\\'s side. I have met him. My sister and I were never without our mom or dad in the room if he was there. \\n\\nFamily did sweep it under the rug, because there is a much longer history between him and my mother. \\n\\nMy parents did try to get him charged, but the prosecutor wouldn\\'t go through with it. Two sperm donors created reasonable doubt even though yes it was her brother. Incestuous relationships happen more often than we think there I guess was his reason. Plus my maternal grandmother and the rest of them didn\\'t believe her. \\n\\nMy mom didn\\'t go No Contact until 2005 when the straw finally broke the camel\\'s back. Why that long, I have no idea. Those are her reasons. \\n\\nShe did resume contact a few years ago bc my grandmother was dying. I guess there was a big talk and she begged for forgiveness.\\n\\nGrandmother is dead now.\\n\\nThis happened in Louisiana. \\n\\nEDIT 2: Mods, if this isn\\'t considered appropriate for this sub, please feel free to take it down. I thought I fucked up by the secret coming out in the first place. But it is a happy ending. I leave it up to you glorious mods.\\n\\n**TL;DR:** I found out I could have been the product of a rape - by my Uncle. Anxiety and tears ensued. Found out I am my father\\'s daughter. Surprised them. Happy Ending! The wonderful, wonderful guy (27M) that I’ve (27F) been seeing for the past few months invited me to come over to his place last weekend. Let’s call him Gardening Club Guy. \\n\\nSo I spend the day before plucking, prepping and getting the perfect outfit together for my night with GCG. I ultimately choose a nice little push up bra that matched my undies and made the titties look very nice. I don’t normally wear bras like that, but it seemed like the occasion to.\\n\\nWhat started as a great night together, turned into a great morning together, which turned into a great afternoon and evening together! \\n\\nI eventually return to my place and start reminiscing of the stellar sex that was had, and decide to shoot GCG a message about how last night I thoroughly enjoyed whatever he did with his tongue that made it feel like there was a tiny tornado rampaging my clit (I firmly believe if your partner does something you like/ that gets you off and you want them to do it again..TELL THEM)\\n\\nGCG thanks me and then says “ So last night when I was feeling your breast..”\\n\\nand here I am, getting in the mood to do some reminiscing when all of the sudden GCG drop kicks my life with “...I felt a firm lump on your left breast. I didn’t want to not say anything.” \\n\\nSo now I’ve gone from horny to horrified in 2 seconds flat. I had just gotten a breast exam a few months ago, so it seemed downright impossible..\\n\\nAt this point, I’m grabbing my breasts like a mad woman trying to feel for any weird lumps, when the deceivingly nice little push up bra thrown over the chair catches my gaze. \\n\\nThe realization sets in and I start spontaneously laugh-crying. \\n\\nGCG got a firm hold of the spillage/over flow of boob that didn’t quite make it into the bra.\\n\\nHe grabbed the fat.\\n\\nThen proceeded to inform me of his findings.\\n\\nI thanked him and let him know about my previous cleared breast exam, but welcomed him to come by to feel me up and really show me what he meant..you know, just to be sure. He was happy to hear I had one done so recently and said he’d be more then happy to show me.\\n\\nBasically I’ve found a super sweet guy who I get along with wonderfully, and clearly doesn’t want me to die anytime soon. I’m extremely thankful. \\n\\nTL;DR hook up thought he found a lump in my breast that turned out to just be a fat roll due to an ill fitting bra\\n\\nEdit: I got a breast exam at my local plannned parenthood yesterday just to be sure. No cancer here, just fat!\\n\\nEdit: I’m sorry I forgot to tag NSFW! My bad, I really should have seen that one coming. For those asking about planned parenthood, the facility in my area is called a family planning center. They offer yearly exams, information about birth control, std testing etc. I believe they work with planned parenthood. And to clarify the fuck uppery on my part lol, I could have  avoided a really awkward conversation if I had just worn proper fitting clothing. I really didn\\'t think this could possibly backfire on me until about 30 minutes ago. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMy daughter is **d r a m a t i c**. She would step on a piece of dirt on the floor and fall down screaming \"Me hurt foot\" or hit her head on a pillow and make a huge deal out of it. We don\\'t watch soccer so I have no idea where this behavior came from. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShe is 2. I am her mom so she believes everything I say. I used this to my advantage and told her that kisses fix everything. Stub your toe? Get a kiss. Smack yourself in the face with a broom? Kiss. Cut your finger with the fake knife? Kiss. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt was going great. She caught on quick and, instead of screaming, always asked for a kiss for her \"hurt\". How could this go wrong? Well I did not foresee the world falling apart and needing to work from home with my 6 month old and 2 year old. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSome days it\\'s great. They are amazing and the only reason I\\'m staying sane. Other days.... Nothing makes you reevaluate your decision to have 2 kids 18 months apart like being trapped in a house with them 24/7. *kidding*\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nToday is one of those days. My daughter was eating her breakfast while I was on a video call. She bit her tongue and started crying. Then she stopped and I saw the look on her face. She recovered and I thought she figured it out on her own and forget about it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo here I sit on a very important video meeting and my 2 year old comes running in screaming \"MOMMY KISS TONGUE\". I am trying to shift my 6 month old so I can turn off the audio and video. I managed to mute it (after she screamed of course) but didn\\'t get the video shut off in time. My 2 year old sticks her tongue out and shoves it at me for a kiss as I\\'m opening my mouth to tell her no. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd that\\'s how her tongue went straight in my mouth  while all my coworkers were watching. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNext time on Our Series of Unfortunate Events, she will probably be naked climbing the cabinets in the background. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit: For all of you so concerned that my terrible parenting is the reason my daughter is dramatic - My daughter\\'s behaviors are constantly and appropriately ignored/redirected and she uses a social-emotional program to learn how to handle big emotions in a little body. (Almost like I do this for a living!) She is intelligent, kind, caring, and yes, *dramatic*. She is strong-willed and a performer. She will put on a show even if her teddy bear is the only one watching. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd yes, I did teach her kisses fix her hurt. That is something I specifically did for MY child because, personally, I don\\'t think it\\'s so bad to live in a world where mama can fix everything, even if only for a little while. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: taught my daughter that kisses fix hurt and she French kissed me So my wife and I have a four year old and a one year old.  When our one year old is up to mischief and we tell him \"no\" he immediately looks up at us and starts crying.  It\\'s actually pretty adorable.\\n\\nIn order not to upset him we frequently refer to it as the \"N Word\" when he\\'s around.  \\n\\nQueue two weeks ago when our four year old is in daycare and telling all his friends and the teacher that \"mommy and daddy use the N Word all the time and it upsets his brother and makes him cry\".  Teacher berated my wife and told her we were horrible people and didn\\'t really get it when my wife explained that it was a big mix up.\\n\\nWe also got Child Protective Services called on us anonymously.  Think it\\'s the teacher but it may have been a parent.\\n\\nTLDR: Everyone at our kids school thinks we are constantly throwing \"the bad N word\" around our sons and are horrible people and parents.\\n I’ve began visiting this new health-drink tea/smoothie shop by my work. I guess i misunderstood the menu in that i thought i was choosing nutrient boosts to add to my tea that i ordered, not knowing that those boosts were entirely different drinks that come as a smoothie. Those take longer to make than the tea so each time he had given me my tea, i had taken it and left before he could make my smoothie. It’s only 1 dude who works there and he finally stopped me today. I was so confused why i was getting 2 drinks and he was equally confused at the fact that i was confused why i was getting 2 drinks. He explained it to me and i realized what i had been doing. He tried to do the math and give me a cash refund for all the days i had left without picking up my other drink, but i just put it in his tip jar.\\n\\nTLDR: I’m an idiot\\n\\nEDIT: for those who are curious, this is NOT a Herbalife or other MLM shop. I’m very aware of Herbalife so when i heard of a new health drink shop opening up i rolled my eyes. Did some research, talked to the owner, and can gladly say this is not one of those 🥳\\n\\nEDIT: wow i didn’t expect this to blow up. Thank you to everyone who’s enjoyed the story of my clueless self! I’m glad we can all laugh at something together during these rough times Last Saturday, I woke up in the middle of the night. No big deal, but I immediately noticed something wrong with my left ear. I had no pain, but every few seconds I would hear a loud crackling noise in my ear. I have experienced an earwax blocking before, but I had never heard this sound before. This made me concerned, so I tried googling my symptoms, but to no avail.  \"It\\'s probably just an earwax blockage, right?\", I think to myself. I stuffed a cotton pad with olive oil in my ear to soften the earwax and returned to bed. After putting the cotton pad in my ear, the crackling sound stopped, but it was replaced with some soft ticking sounds. It made it hard to fall asleep, but eventually, I managed to drift off\\n\\nThe next morning, the noises in my left ear had stopped. Great, but there was still wax in my ear, because I could hear it move when I put pressure on my ears. Over the course of the next days, I tried to remove the ear wax myself. I put water in my ear, more cotton pads with olive oil and I even tried to get it out with tweezers (I know I shouldn\\'t have done that, but I was impatient and really wanted to just get the earwax out and be done with it). All these methods failed to get the earwax out, until today.\\n\\nI was once again stupidly poking around with tweezers inside my ear, when I finally managed to grab the earwax. Excited, I took it out and wanted to look at what my ear had just birthed. To my horror, the blockage in my left ear was not caused by earwax, but it was caused by what looked like a kind of tiny moth. This creature had somehow managed to climb into my ear at 2 a.m., caused me to wake up and couldn\\'t leave my ear because of the cotton pad I had stuffed inside.\\n\\nI am still trying to process that I had a dead moth in my ear for half a week.\\n\\n\\nEdit: Thank you for the awards and for all of your own ear bug horror stories in the comments! It makes me feel less unfortunate to have experienced this. Also, to answer a common question: I posted a picture of the moth in the comments and people have been asking how big it was. It looks pretty big in the picture, but it was only around a centimeter big.\\n\\n\\n\\nTL;DR I thought I had an earwax blockage, tried removing it on my own, turned out it was a moth trying to make my ear its home or something. I’m a college student, hustling as a waitress in a swank restaurant to pay for school. A cute married couple are my regulars. One recent date night, they were sniping a touch at each other about their son, who was struggling in math. They asked my opinion. Then the wife asked me if I would consider tutoring him this summer. I thought I’d see them again the next week, but then the wheels fell off the world.\\n\\nLast night, I was running delivery out to cars. I see Mr. Married. Shifts are limited, so I need cash badly- online tutoring would be great. I virtually body slam my co-worker to deliver his food. On a piece of paper, I scribble my number and march out.\\n\\nHe smiles.\\n\\nI hand him the food, and then I slip the paper with my number to him.\\n\\nCue the deer-in-the-headlights stare from the man. Slow blink.\\n\\nI do not clue into the FU. I say, “Your wife said you were interested…”\\n\\nHis head shifts 45 degrees, cocked and questioning. He stares blankly at me, inexplicably silent.\\n\\nIn a moment of cognitive dissonance, I hear my brain misfire as I realize he thinks I’m propositioning him.\\n\\nI blurt, “Tutoring. Your wife wanted me to tutor your son in math.”\\n\\nHe nods slowly, and we both pretend that shit show didn’t just happen as he says, “Yeah. Alright. Okay. Bye.”\\n\\nI fake a smile and bolt back inside.\\n\\nI’m half-hoping I never have to see the man again but the other half knows that I have 4 packs of ramen left and prays this traumatic cringe has not made it too excruciatingly awkward to hire me.\\n\\nTL:DR gave a married man my number to tutor his son. He thought I was hitting on him.\\n\\nEdit: thank you for the concern about my supply of ramen. I am strapped for cash, but my BF is still working and very willing to share. Also, my boss sends us all home with all the leftovers he can spare. Seriously, thanks, fam. You are spectacular humans! Now this TIFU didn\\'t happen today, it was a couple of weeks ago and I am still struggling to come to terms with the embarrassment, for both me and my girlfriend.\\n\\nSo, a few weeks ago I was at my GF\\'s house, usually the plan when I go is I sit around with her parents for around 30mins-1hr or so with just general chatting etc then we go off to her room to watch TV, play games and other stuff. Everything was normal, I chat to her parents then go up to her room with her and start watching general TV.\\n\\nThis is where the fuck up happens.\\n\\nAfter around an hour or so, me and my GF were bored and she was feeling pretty horny today (not normal behaviour, especially whilst her parents are home) and begins to undress me and start giving me a handjob.\\n\\nI\\'m enjoying this more than I ever have, most likely because of the risk factor involved with her parents being home, which just made it feel so much better. Although the risk wasn\\'t huge, because her parents have never disturbed us once since I started going there, they just leave us to it but still, the slight risk just made it feel really good.\\n\\nShe starts kissing my chest, them down to my waist and then starts sucking my dick. Literally within less than 30 seconds, I\\'m already ready to release my load, I try to get her to slow down and stop to save my embarrassment from prematurely ejacating but I just can\\'t, it feels too good. \\n\\nRight on queue, her door starts to open so my girlfriend quickly stops, in walks her mother to ask us a question about going out for dinner together... she instantly gets an eye full of my girlfriend on her knees on the bed next to my dick whilst I\\'m there in my birthday suit. My girlfriend stopped too late though, so whilst she\\'s staring at her mum in shock who\\'s staring at both of us in even more shock I release my load all over my body in front of both of them, and she wasn\\'t even sucking my dick at the time. Not only was it a ruined orgasm, her mother also got to see the final credits. Her mother didn\\'t even say a word, she just walked back out and closed the door behind her.\\n\\nI sit there completely naked, covered in my own cum in just pure embarrassment. My girlfriend went to get me tissue to sort myself out and then I hid in her room until they had gone to sleep and it was time to leave.\\n\\nAlthough me and my GF are still together, I haven\\'t been back or spoken to them since :(\\n\\nTL;DR - GF was giving me a blowjob whilst her mother walked in, she stopped but it was too late and I ejaculated all over myself in front of both her and her mother, whilst in my birthday suit. This actually happened on September 11th 2001 and the memory has just came back to me.\\n\\nHere is a little background leading up to the fuck up. I was 11 years old and began to have really bad pains around my lower back. Went to the doctor and x-rays confirm that I was having a kidney stone. Doctors thought it was highly unusual for an 11 year old to have kidney stones so they made me an appointment with a specialist.\\n\\nFast forward a week later, 9/11, I return to a specialist doctor so they could check me out and run more tests. So, my dad and I are waiting in the room waiting for the doctor, playing \"I spy\" or something, and they doctor walks in. He tells us that he wants to check my prostate to see if there is anything unusual going on.  My dad consented and then I was told to drop my pants. \\n\\nThe doctor puts on his gloves, gets the lube ready and then it was go time. The doctor then checks my prostate, feeling all around to determine is there was anything unusual. Here is where the fuck up comes. While the doc is doing his thing, I look straight into my dads eyes and say \"wow this feels good\".  My dad just looks at me with a blank stare. At the time I didn\\'t think anything of the comment but now looking back, i\\'m not sure who felt more uncomfortable, my dad or the doctor who was still conducting the test. I cringe every time I think about this now.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\ntl:dr -- Got my prostate checked out by a doctor in front of my dad and told him it \"felt good\" This happened last night/the wee hours of this morning. \\n\\nLast night while my SO was at work, she asked me to pick up tampons on my way home. She is a bartender and didn’t want to stop at a store or gas station late night when she got off. \\n\\nMe, being a guy, completely forgets until about 30 minutes until she is scheduled to get off work. So I jump in the truck and haul ass to the nearest 24 hour mega store. \\n\\nWhile I’m making my journey, I decide to roll the windows down and blast some music to enjoy the summer air. I’m in a pretty great mood. I had the day off and my SO was about to be off and we had plans to binge watch some New Girl. \\n\\nMy journey into town is about a 35 minute drive down a road with literally no streetlights and no buildings. Just open desert. So while admiring the full moon, my mind starts to wander. “What can I do to add a little romance to this situation? Cover the bed in some dove chocolates? Maybe some flowers?” \\n\\nI make it to the store, retrieve the items, and start my trek back home. Miraculously, I made it back home before her.\\n\\nFinally I decide, “Nah, romance isn’t nearly as great as comedy.” So when I get home, I break open the box and spell out “Anal?” on the bed with the tampons. \\n\\nSO gets home and goes straight to the room to change. I follow her in seconds later and find her on the floor laughing. \\n\\nShe takes a picture, posts it on r/funny (her second post ever) and it blows up. Now she won’t stop teasing me about having more karma and how she is “famous”. \\n\\nI’ve created a monster. \\n\\nTLDR; Spelled out “Anal?” with my SO’s tampons. She thought it was funny and posted it on reddit. Reddit agreed and now she thinks she’s famous and is holding her new found karma over my head.\\n\\nEdit: WOW! My first ever medal. Thank you kind stranger. Now at least I can hold this over her head whenever she randomly shouts out how much karma she has.\\n\\nEdit 2: gentleman, we are currently in the lead. Whoever has more karma at the end of the night gets to fuck the others ass.\\n\\nEdit 3: we are ending this “contest” at 11:59 PST on 7/17/19. It looks like I am going to win but since she is not able to edit/update her original post, I would like to say a few things... I had no clue this would blow up like this. I thought I’d get 10 upvotes and send it to her as a joke when she was being obnoxious about having 2500 more karma than me in the span of a day while I’ve been in here for a year. This has made our day off together one of the best ones in a while. \\n\\nThat being said, please go show her some of that love I know reddit is so capable of showing. She is truly my better half and deserves all the attention and happy comments. Hey guys so today is the first day of the new Semester where I\\'m from (germany) and i woke up at 11:02am since i thought my first lecture would be at 2pm. I then woke up to an e-mail saying there was a zoom meeting at 11am. So i immediatly turned on my pc and joined the meeting and asked a friend of mine if he also joined ? He didnt even know what i was talking about so i texted him the meeting id and the password and asked him if he wanted to listen to the lecture together on discord. He said \"yes\" so we hopped onto the discord together and begun trashtalking the prof for the bad communication where i called him a son of a bitch for sending the mail at 10am for a lesson at 11am. Now heres the problem. Every lecture i had last semester immediatly muted everyone who joined so in my mind i was muted....Turns out i wasnt and immediatly my phone got flooded with messages asking me to turn my mic off.Great start to the new Semster, i hope you guys had a better day than me today :D\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR thought i was muted and called my prof a son of a bitch in fornt of 150 people while trashtalking him with my friend I (a 18m) fucked up tonight.\\n\\nIt was about time I was going to bed, but I needed to take a shower. Right before I went to the bathroom, I popped a warhead sour candy in my mouth. I went to the bathroom, stripped down and hopped in the shower. just as I put my head up in the shower to rinse my face, the warhead in my mouth slipped back and *got stuck in my throat AND I STARTED CHOKING.* I realized this, and after a few seconds of \\'AWGHWAGWHAGWH\\' I jumped out of the shower and RAN out of the bathroom, to my parents room, the only place where people are that could help me. I BARGED into their room, cheeks out, balls-a-dangling, and continued my \\'AWAGWGHAWGAHW\\' noises. Their initial reaction is what you would expect for you to run in buck naked in front of your parents. Then, they realized I was choking, and my dad jumped out of bed, grabbed me and proceeded to do the Heimlich maneuver on me. That hurt like hell, I\\'ll tell you that. after a few reps, the warhead in my throat shot out and landed on the carpet. I collapsed on the ground, soaking wet, legs splayed with His Majesty in full view. I then realized what just happened and I, AN 18 YEAR OLD DUDE, am lying naked in front of my VERY CONCERNED STARING parents. I grabbed the candy, which was lying next to me, shouted a thank you, and BOOKED IT back to the bathroom.\\n\\nI haven\\'t seen either of my parents since, I would like to book a 3am flight to Alaska, if anybody can do that for me HMU\\n\\nTL;DR I choked on candy while in the shower, and my parents had to do the Heimlich maneuver on my naked self. Edit 2: Vielen dank für ihre guten wünsche. Mein deutsch verbessert sich, aber ich lerne immer noch. Ja, ich weiß. Lange zeit.\\n__________________________________________________________\\n\\nEdit: Wow. Ok. First, thanks for the gold and the silver. My most popular post ever is about me being a moron. Good feeling. Yes, I will never be looking at my phone without sitting or lying down again.\\n\\nSecond: for those claiming I\\'m lying because I haven\\'t answered, I\\'m Australian dudes. I posted this at 11pm and then went to sleep. I\\'m in the hospital. Calm the farm. For those who require it though: Broken Leg https://imgur.com/gallery/ur4ietO\\n\\nThird: the language I was working on was German. I\\'m aware of the limitations of Duolingo, but I find it fun. And I\\'m pretty addicted to the whole streak thing\\n\\nFourth: yes. I\\'m an idiot. That\\'s why I posted in TIFU. Right now I\\'m in pain and I thought someone might be able to get some enjoyment out of that because of the absolutely stupid reason.\\n\\n_____________________________________________________________\\nThis just happened today, on mobile so please forgive any typos. Including the one in the title. Should be Duolingo\\n\\nSo this morning was like any other Tuesday morning. I woke up at 7 ready to head into work for my favourite work day of the week. I was gonna learn some new stuff and sit at a desk, not having to interact with customers at all. \\n\\nI get dressed and head out into our stairwell, not bothering to turn on the lights as I head towards the bottom floor and the garage. As I\\'m heading down, I figured it was a great time to pull out Duolingo. Gotta keep up with my streak and all that. \\n\\nAs I\\'m completing the lessons, I\\'m getting towards the dark bit of the stairs. Not noticing or looking where I am going at all, I put out my foot for the next stair and suddenly, I fall. \\n\\nThere is a massive crack as my foot hits the floor at a bizarre angle and I let out a scream. I reach down and touch my leg and notice that my shin should not be bulging like that and scream again, this time with more panic. I can\\'t move the leg, it hurts too much. I crawl my way over to the phone and notice Duolingo still open. Naturally the first thought in my head is, \\'well, this needs to be closed\\' before I called my husband for help and some crutches. As I\\'m waiting for him I look down at my phone. Sure, I\\'m in immense pain... But those daily lessons... \\n\\nI stabilise my knee and promptly reopen the app. And there I am, waiting for crutches, sitting at the bottom of a stairwell, with my leg and ankle bent in two places in a way those parts were very much not supposed to bend, finishing the very lessons that caused me to fall in the first place. \\nThat was 16 hours ago. I am now lying in a hospital bed, unable to sleep, with my broken leg in a plaster cast - and yet still the haunting \"Hoooo\" of that owl calls to me.\\n\\nTL;DR: I fucked up by keeping up with Duolingo and ended up breaking my leg. This happened today. Just a few minutes ago, in fact.\\n\\nA bit of context: I got banned from tinder a few years ago for selling feet pics (oops) but was recently single and wanted to get back in the game. After deciding other dating apps were a little too wholesome for me,\\nI decided to go for Tinder. I needed a phone number that wasn’t blocked, so I used my mom’s and then called her and got the code. I figured, she’s like 60 and probably doesn’t even know what a dating app is, so no harm, no foul right?\\n\\nToday we’re all sitting at the table getting ready to eat breakfast and my step dad comes out and sits down. He’s calm as can be as he butters his toast. He glances up from his paper and says to all of us, “I am packing my things and leaving this afternoon.”\\n\\nI almost spit out my orange juice. My brothers start crying. Mom is sputtering, trying to figure out what is going on. She keeps asking why, and he pulls out a literal printed page from the google search results of “what is tinder”. He hands it to my mom. She doesn’t even know what is going on at this point, she doesn’t remember giving me the code months ago. \\n\\nI grab the paper from her and read it, and realize where I fucked up. I turn to my step dad and let him know, frantically, that it was me. He asks why in the world I would need to use her phone to make the account. I scroll through my phone, find an album of different angles of my FEET, and explain to him. He was thoroughly disgusted, and went back to their room through almost tears of laughter. I don’t think he’s still leaving but my family will never look at my the same again.\\n\\n\\nTL:DR: tried to sell feet pics, got banned from tinder, used my moms phone, danger is afoot Obligatory this didn’t happen today, but actually close to a year ago. Last October to be exact. \\n\\nSo backstory. I had been dating this girl at the time for about 4 months. Her parents were awesome and loving towards me, helping me with car repairs (her dad is great with cars) and her mom just being a very lovingly mother figure. They just didn’t want one thing: us having sex before marriage. They had a lot of reasons. And we were actually planning on it. But we both weren’t virgins, and her parents had no idea she had already lost her virginity. So of course, temptation got the better of us. Okay, end of backstory. \\n\\nShe was a senior in high school and I had just started college about an hour away. We rarely got to see eachother, but when we did, we made it count. We would have fun date nights, cook or go out, and then go back to my place and do the deed. Everytime she would leave I would get sad, but knew I’d see her again. \\n\\nOne time when she came up, she told me she needed to let her mom know she made it safely, and tried calling her. No answer. She said she was gonna text her. Made sense to me. Once she said we had, we got right to business. She put her phone on the bed, and I didn’t even \\n\\nThings went on for awhile. Lots of foreplay and we tried some new positions. Lots of fun. And by the end of it, we both laid down and it was dead silent. Followed by some vibrating. It was her phone ringing, but we couldn’t find it. Then we found it under my ass. We laughed about it for a sec, before she answered. It was her mom. And within seconds, my girlfriend’s expression went from one of laughter, to pure shock and horror. \\n\\nTurns out that she hadn’t clicked send on the text she sent out. So her mom has called us during our deed to make sure she was safe, and our best guess is her phone was underneath, and my ass managed to answer the phone. And in turn, she heard some unbearable noises, followed by my girlfriend calling someone “daddy” who was definitely not her dad (the mother’s words, not mine).  \\n\\nShe told my girlfriend to get her ass home now. \\nMy girlfriend started bawling and started having a panic attack. I attempted to calm her down but she wouldn’t. So I drove her back in her car, all while trying to calm her down and make myself remain calm. Her mother called again and started screaming at her, saying “how could she do this” and other things along those lines. My girlfriend said that we were on our way to talk. Her mother absolutely said I was not allowed over. \\n\\nSo we got back to our hometown, I parked very close to her house, but far enough where we wouldn’t get caught. She drove home. I called my mom for a surprise “I’m home for the weekend”. She came and picked me up, and I bawled in her arms. I told her everything. She comforted me and told me she loved me and would do everything she could to help. \\n\\nWe got back to my house, and I laid in my bed, anxious and nervous. I cried and just waited, hoping to hear from my girlfriend. For the longest time, I thought I never would hear from her again. Then finally, my phone rang, after 4 hours. She said she was coming over and we needed to talk. Once she got to my house, we talked for about 30 minutes. She said her parents were calm now, and then I was gonna be able to come talk. I was nervous, but I loved her so I did it. \\n\\nWhen I got to their house, I walked in and instantly just started apologizing. I went on and on about how “we won’t do it again” and how “we’re just stupid teenagers” and most importantly how I was gonna “rebuild their trust”. Eventually they told me things along the lines of everything was okay, they understood, and they just wanted us to be safe. We opened up a lot about my girlfriends past relationship, and how that guy had hurt her pretty bad emotionally, and they just wanted to protect their daughter.\\n\\nAt the end of it all, I learned they just loved their daughter and didn’t want her getting hurt. But they trusted me. And we are still together, now at 1 year and 2 months in. And everything is cool. Sometimes I worry it’s still weird with her parents, but they still show me the same love and support. \\n\\nTLDR: My girlfriend and I took phone sex to a whole other level.\\n\\nEdit: holy fuck you guys I went to class and come out and this is what I see???? Thank you so much for the gold stranger. My first gold! So I’ve been spending A LOT of time around dogs. I’ve recently been hired by friends families and family friends to walk or watch their dogs. My reddit is COVERED in dogs from various sources. My Facebook is solely dog pages and dog-related charities. Basically everywhere I turn, I see dog. Not a bad life to live. Until yesterday (YIFU I know). I walked one of my mother’s friends dog to a dog friendly pub and sat in the garden enjoying a drink and the sun. It wasn’t very busy with only a few other people sat outside around me. It’s hot. I’ve just walked in the sun for maybe 20 minutes, stupidly, without water. I want to blame dehydration for this FU, but really I know I’m just an idiot. A couple of young ladies are sat a few tables away from me, talking and cooing over a pushchair. My first thought is that in that pushchair... is a dog. I don’t know. It’s a hot day and I’ve seen dogs in pushchairs before. Maybe they didn’t want its paws on hot tarmac. Maybe they’re just a little extra. Regardless, the thought that babies exist didn’t enter my tiny stupid brain. As they got up to leave and walk by me, I decided to be a friendly fellow dog walker and looked up at them, uttered the words “What breed is it?” and gestured towards the pushchair. They looked very confused, and slightly offended, and proceeded to hurry away. It was a baby. A HUMAN baby. I’m so glad they took the traditional British approach of confused stare and silence. If they had said something I think I would have disintegrated on the spot. It was a long walk home after that and thankfully, I didn’t pass anymore pushchairs. \\n\\nTL;DR I asked a woman what breed her baby was after seeing one too many dog on the Internet. I’m stupid and messed up the title: **FINAL UPDATE**\\n\\n[ORIGINAL POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/in9dks/tifu_by_telling_my_gf_of_3_months_that_i_love_her/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\\n\\n[SECOND POST](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/inrf0t/tifu_by_telling_my_gf_of_3_months_that_i_love_her/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)\\n\\n\\nOkay everyone, it’s been a wild last few days. This has been the most trying time in my life and I’m ready to settle back down to a boring life until I die.\\n\\nI’d like to start by saying thanks to everyone that gave me advice and awards and shared similar stories of something that happened to them, it’s given me lots of strength and made me realize I’m not alone in this shit.\\n\\nTo the other people that DM’d me trying to get my information, sent threats, and acted like a psycho — you guys need help.\\n\\nAnyway, before I conclude with the final (hopefully, I pray) update to my situation, I just want to address a few of the most common questions from last thread:\\n\\n1. \\nQ. How did I check the cameras if my phone was in the kitchen and why didn’t I use my computer to call for help?!\\n\\nA. I have a computer in my bedroom that is hooked up to my cameras. As for why I didn’t go on zuckerberg’s spy network to send out a distress call — well the first thing on my mind was getting the hell out of there. When my girlfriend was throwing herself at the door, screaming like a banshee the last thing I thought of was using the computer. I only got on to see if she was gone after I heard the front door slam shut. \\n\\n2.\\nQ. Why did she get so mad when you said you were going to call her mom?\\n\\nA. She was living with both of us. I generally work 12 hour shifts 3-5 days per week, she will stay with me on my days off but usually spends her days with her mom. I figured I could speak with her mom about why the hell my girlfriend was having a psychotic breakdown.\\n\\n3\\nQ. Wow you were scared of a 110lb (50kg) girl? You are a pussy!!\\n\\nA. Well as an adult male that is about double her weight, I don’t think beating the shit out of my girlfriend is the best move, even if it is self defense. Yeah the cameras would likely clear me of wrongdoing, but why risk that?? If your first instinct is to beat the shit out of someone that’s sad.\\n\\n4.\\nQ. How old are you guys\\n\\nA. Definitely old enough to know better than what has been going on. 25+ for both of us.\\n\\n5. \\n\\nQ. Why don’t you post the video? Just blur the faces! You’re a big fat liar if you don’t!\\n\\nA. I’ll get into that more later. But after getting a shit ton of creepy ass reddit DM’s asking for my name, age, location, and basically every other identifying characteristic, why the shit would I even remotely consider letting strangers find me. Some of you are very deranged.\\n\\nNow, I’ll try to answer any more questions on the thread that get upvoted, so feel free to ask away and upvote questions you may have.\\n\\nAlright, fasten the seatbelts, hold onto your hats, grab your popcorn for the inevitable freaks of nature in the comments frothing at the mouth to burn the witch (me).\\n\\nI’ll start where I left off. My girlfriend leaves the house, slams the door, I make sure she’s gone. \\n\\nI peek my head out, heart still racing, wondering what the fuck just happened. Well I call her mom and say “uhh your daughter just had a psychotic breakdown in my home and I explained what happened.”\\n\\nShe legit calmly says, “yeah that’s happened before a few times.” I’m just thinking, “wtf? Wouldn’t it be important that I knew my girlfriend could contemplate murdering me in the middle of the night?” I refrained from asking this right then. I just told her mom, “well she can’t stay here, I’m gonna pack up her stuff and I can either drop it off or you can pick it up.” She tells me she will stop by tomorrow to pick it up. Fine.\\n\\nMy plan of action at this point is to batten down the hatches. I call a locksmith to get my locks changed that day (girlfriend had a key to the place) and I get some bars from a hardware store down the road so the windows couldn’t be opened (I’m renting a 2 story home). I bar the windows, change the locks, and have a couple of friends take my car to their place so it doesn’t get vandalized.\\n\\nI’m all settled in, bunker mode. I pull out my snacks and pop on some television with some friends over to try and escape reality. All in all, a pretty uneventful night. I thought about calling the police but I’m just relieved that she’s gone and I can finally forget about that shit.\\n\\nWell this morning rolls around. I get a call from her mom early. Apparently she wants to explain her daughters odd behavior and gives me her history. \\n\\nApparently my girlfriend had been abused my her dad when she was younger 8-12. Her dad is now in prison for violent crimes and has no relationship with either her nor her mom. Her mom remarries a seemingly nice guy, who was then again abusive to my girlfriend before she moved out at 18. She gave me some details of both abuse, which I do not feel comfortable sharing here, I’ll just say it is some of the worst kind of abuse you can endure. The legal system took care of both offenders. \\n\\nMy girlfriend never shared this with me, not that it was really any of my business. I think it’s terrible what happened and hope she can get the help she needs — I am not trained to deal with that.\\n\\nMoving on, after my girlfriend left last night, she ended up with an old acquaintance who just happened to be her old meth dealer. \\n\\nNow I had no fucking clue she had a history of meth use. If you saw my now ex gf she looks nothing like a meth user. She keeps herself very clean and presentable. Apparently her mom knew about this and she had just finished rehab prior to us dating. At this point I’m like “gee thanks for pawning off this burden to me as if I could heal whatever is broken in her.” \\n\\nSo she shows up to her moms house last night drugged up. Her mom takes her to a psychiatric rehab facility to, I hope, recover from her mental condition and drug addiction. \\n\\nI wish her nothing but the best but I cannot handle that in my life. I would describe myself as a pretty boring guy. I try to stay away from any drama, but apparently I didn’t do a good enough job.\\n\\nAfter hearing about the meth use and reading online about the weird shit that people on meth do, I decided to check my cameras for weird activity the week or two preceding these events. What I found was deeply disturbing.\\n\\nFirst, about 7 days before this breakdown I left for work (I generally work 12’s 7am-7pm). At around noon my girlfriend enters my home, and creeps around the place like a burglar in the night. Opening drawers and the fridge, looking under the couch, under the dining room table, basically turning the place upside down. Tidies everything back up and leaves. \\n\\nThe next day she comes in again. This time she isn’t alone. She comes in with some homeless looking dude that looks dirty as fuck and she searches the place. Not as thoroughly as before, but thoroughly enough. What pissed me off is this dude comes in and starts going through my pantry and eating my snacks. At this point I’m pretty grossed out that some dude on meth is putting is grimy hands in my chips and popping a hard boiled egg in his mouth. Like bro that’s my breakfast. He didn’t eat them all, just one. \\n\\nThis is when her fascination with the dish rag became apparent. They move to my couch and stare at the TV for 2 hours. Saying nothing, and thankfully not having sex. She wet the dish rag in the sink and stuffed the wet half in her mouth. Both of them just sat there and then after a couple hours they get up and leave.\\n\\nThird day, nothing. \\n\\nFourth day: my last day on shift, girlfriend comes in with guy again, he notices the cameras pointing in the living room. He points his finger at it, and holds it there for 5 or so minutes while he and my GF sit on the couch. She’s going full on zombie mode staring straight ahead and he finally pokes her to get her attention. She knew about the cameras but this is the first time she has a keen interest in them. They both get up and stand right in the cameras view. I get a good look at this guy. He looks like your stereotypical homeless man that does meth. They both look like zombies, similar to how my girlfriend looked when I woke up with her standing over me, although this was much worse. They stared at the camera for an hour before he decided he was hungry for some of my pretzels. And then they left.\\n\\nThis was a very disturbing thing to see today so if anyone has any idea what the hell happened please let me know. I have zero idea of what meth addiction entails along with mental health disorders. \\n\\nMy lease ends in October and I’m getting the hell out of here and never coming back. For now, I’ll be peeking over my shoulder and locking my doors at all times. I’m praying this Is the last update, I have no clue how long my ex will be hospitalized for.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo you’re probably dying to see the video. Well I won’t be posting it. She has serious mental and drug abuse issues. I’m not going to make her a laughing stock of reddit. The story will have to suffice.\\n\\nI figure I’ll put some phone numbers here for people struggling with mental health and or drug addiction (for US   Folks). People in other countries feel free to drop your numbers down in the comments.\\n\\n\\n\\nSAMHSA’s National Helpline – 1-800-662-HELP (4357)\\n\\n\\nTl;dr gf was abused as a kid, addicted to meth, now in psychiatric hospital. I’m hoping she gets better but the relationship is done. Title speaks for itself. I was trying to inject mice to give them cancer and accidentally poked my finger. It started bleeding and its possible that the cancer cells could\\'ve entered my bloodstream.\\n\\nCurrently patiently waiting at the ER.\\n\\nWish me luck Reddit.\\n\\nEdit: just to clarify, mice don\\'t get T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) naturally. These is an immortal T-ALL from humans.\\n\\nUpdate: Hey guys, sorry for the late update but here\\'s the situation:\\nDoctor told me what most of you guys have been telling me that my immune system will likely take care of it. But if any swelling deveps I should come see them. My PI was very concerned when I told her but were hoping for the best. I\\'ve filled out the WSIB forms just in case.\\n\\nThanks for all your comments guys. \\n\\nI\\'ll update if anything new comes up I finally get to post a fuck up. Happened an hour ago, still afraid for my life.\\n\\nMy gf and I were playing mario party 7 for the first time ever. Awful game by the way. Anyways, as most of you probably know, you can pick what direction you character travels around the map. The gf, in 3rd place with nearly 100 coins is making her way around the map.\\n\\nThe star was right in front of her at the crossroad. \\n\\nAs she approached the crossroad to pick up the star, i sarcastically suggested she go right.\\n\\nWhich she immediately did.\\n\\nI have never seen anyone so angry in my life, and I\\'ve worked both as nightclub security and loss prevention in my time. Nor have I ever been so afraid. She ended the game with 0 stars...\\n\\n\"I will kill you in your sleep\" she stated.\\n\\nThe rest of the game was spent in dread. Its now 3am and I\\'m hiding in the bathroom typing this while she makes serial killer noises.\\n\\nGoodbye.\\n\\nTl;dr Mario Party 7 is a terrible game. When I was 7 ,about 12 years ago, me and a few of my buddies here playing pretend as spies on the bus home from school. So spy\\'s have the cool invisible speaker in their ears to contact people and I thought it would be a good idea to use a googly eye that  I had lifted from school in the place of this speaker.\\nThe googly eye idea worked perfectly for a minute until I had pressed it too far into my ear and in trying to grab it out I pushed it even further in. I was kind of worried at this point and decided to ask my big cousin, who was on the bus, if she could get it but she said you couldn\\'t see it in my ear. I could hear it rattling and it was very annoying but being too scared to tell my dad, I stupidly decided to let it be for the time being. After a few days it stopped rattling and i assumed it had fell out and that was the end of that...\\n\\nSkip forward to this Tuesday;\\nI do kayaking at university and got a big slap on the head with a paddle and I was submerged under water, after I emerged and pulled my boat out I could hear a slight rattle in my ear and I knew instantly what it was.\\nIt\\'s now Friday and the rattling happens every time I turn my head and I still haven\\'t build up the nerve to go to the doctor and confess my unusual prosthesis.\\n\\nTLDR: Put googly eye in ear 12 years ago, thought googly fell out shortly after... It didn\\'t\\n\\nUPTATE:\\nSo this got alot of traction and a good few fellas are posting that they don\\'t believe it, which is fair enough cause I think it\\'s abit mental aswell.\\n\\nHowever I\\'ll get a doctor\\'s visit sorted by the end of this week hopefully and I\\'ll get some photos up onto the sub in an update post.\\n\\nAlot of people are saying about getting my ears checked up yearly and I can honestly say I don\\'t have yearly checkups or have had an ear exam by an actual doctor, someone correct me if I\\'m wrong but I don\\'t think they\\'re as big of thing in the UK.\\n\\nThanks for hearing me out This TIFU is still occurring but it started last week and that day started normal like always, I went to work and when I went to lunch it turned to the worst week of my life.  I was sent on lunch and while I was eating my tongue ring somehow came off and instead of what I initially thought was me swallowing it, the xrays at the hospital showed it was inhaled and went into my lung.   Since they had to do an X-ray and a cat scan, I was asked if I was pregnant, I told them absolutely not.  Since I have the Paraguard IUD implanted(birth control).  They did blood work and then came to speak to me and told me that I was in-fact pregnant!  I was absolutely shocked and scared, I called my husband and my mom and told them the news, my husband rushed to the hospital and when he got here he asked if I told them about the IUD which I had not yet.  When he told them they said after they performed the  bronchoscopy, they would have to immediately remove the IUD. The procedure was really simple and they removed the tongue ring in 30 minutes and I was fine for the most part other than a sore throat.  They came and spoke to me about the pregnancy and the problems the iUD can present to it, they immediately removed the iud and told me that it was bent and slipped down which is the reason it didn’t work properly after me having it for more than a year.  They also scheduled a ultrasound, when they went in for the ultrasound they couldn’t find the pregnancy which raised some concerns, ultimately after two days of waiting in the icu they confirmed it was an Ectopic pregnancy, they said the pregnancy was very early so they sent me home with a shot to kill the pregnancy and I was to follow up every two days at a clinic to make sure the pregnancy was being successfully terminated.  Everything was alright and even though I had cramps and all other sorts of side effects as long as they weren’t too sever I would be fine.  I was feeling completely better Saturday morning, but after a shower i suddenly felt a sharp pain on my shoulder and then sever abdominal pain that left me incapacitated, I’ve never felt such severe pain, after speaking to the clinic through the phone they told me to immediately head to the ER, when I arrived they performed an ultrasound which almost made me pass out from the pain and they confirmed my pregnancy burst inside my ovary and I was bleeding internally, so I’m now back home but after the worst weekend of my life I’m left out of work for at least 6 weeks and struggling to get out of bed.  They said if I had not come in I would be dead. Luckily the doctors were able to save my ovary.  \\n\\nTl:dr   Inhaled my tongue ring, got diagnosed with an ectopic pregnancy, the pregnancy burst in my ovary and almost killed me. This happened only minutes ago.\\n\\n\\nThe graphics card in my old PS2 decided it wanted to give up on me recently, so I decided to replace it when I had a little extra cash. I was out browsing different sites like Craigslist and the like, when I stumbled upon the PS2 mentioned in the title. It looked like a great deal at the time. $25 to buy it from this guy, whereas a secondhand store in town was selling them for around $45 to $60.\\n\\n\\nAt the time, this seemed like a no-brainer.\\n\\n\\nNow, I should preface this by saying that I have a strange faith in the honesty of others. Benefit of the doubt and all that noise. After all, the car I drive now is one I bought from a guy on the internet, and it runs great for something that is 27 years old. Why should this be any different?\\n\\n\\nStarting to sound like a mistake yet?\\n\\n\\nIf the answer is \"no,\" then have no fear. That is almost certainly about to change. The model the seller advertised on Letgo was one of the larger black brick models. Like, the first generation ones. When I finally met the seller, we had a brief handshake and exchange. When he showed me the goods, It was actually one of the slim and silver PS2\\'s from later in the console\\'s production run. He told me he had already sold the larger one.\\n\\n\\nMy first instinct, as many logical redditors would tell me, is that I should have walked away when I saw I was being sold something that was improperly advertised. Unfortunately for me (and I guess, fortunately for the rest of you reading this), I was not in the most logical mood. It was kind of a shitty drive to a pretty sketchy part of town, and it had already been a long morning. I just wanted to get this thing and go home.\\n\\n\\nBack at the ole ranch, I hooked up the console, slapped in Kingdom Hearts II, and got ready to enjoy the rest of my day. I\\'m off work and done with class, what else would I do with my evening, right? I was pretty happy with my life until I realized I had been waiting for five or so minutes and the disc wasn\\'t reading. Strange, but not altogether discouraging. I slapped in another game that I new for sure was working. Didn\\'t read. I repeated this several times with discs I knew would work; same story.\\n\\n\\nNow I\\'m starting to get slightly pissed. I\\'m sure you can see where this next part is going.\\n\\n\\nI open up the app to message the seller and let him know he had sold me a defective console. Not so much to my surprise, he had blocked me. I\\'ve now got no way to contact him. Of course not, he just took me for a fucking ride. All I could do at that point was report him and live in my shame. That, or I could get onto YouTube and try to find a fix for a disc-read error. I picked the latter option and went on my merry way. After a video about a quick mod I could make to the system, I was feeling pretty confident that I was going to get the last laugh on this one.\\n\\n\\nOh golly gee fuck was I wrong.\\n\\n\\nNow at this point, I begin to tumble from my perch of the high and mighty, and start snowballing right down that tall fucking mountain. I manage to get the appropriate screws out and pry that bad boy open. It\\'s putting up a little more of a fight than I saw in the videos, but why wouldn\\'t it? It was never meant to be opened this way in the first place. With a little elbow grease, it starts to give. I\\'m also starting to spot a bit of rust in one of the memory card slots. A bit annoying, but the other one was working a few minutes ago so I can live with that. The further I get it open, the more rust I see on some more critical pieces. I\\'m sweating again, but holding out hope. Finally, the plastic casing comes free, and I experience the joy of a man that is working with his own two hands to solve a problem.\\n\\n\\nI experience this joy for maybe a second and a half.\\n\\n\\nYou see, after prying the top casing off of the console, the bottom half sort of clattered back down onto the desk. The first thing I notice is that the inside is covered in rust. The second thing I notice is that some of the rust is moving.\\n\\n\\nOh, that\\'s not all rust.\\n\\n\\n*Ohsonofabitchthosearefuck-motheringcockroaches.*\\n\\n\\nDo you know that scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark where Indiana Jones is like, \"Snakes. Why did it have to be snakes?\" That was me. Except with Cockroaches. They are the one insect that fill me with more disgust than anything else. And now they\\'re crawling on my hands. And these are the quick little tiny ones that don\\'t give two fucks about whether you\\'ve stepped on them or not. I threw that whole console on the ground post haste, which only made them more riled up.\\n\\n\\nThey\\'re getting everywhere now. I\\'m yelling for help to my roommates and stomping the ground like a fucking mad man in a fit of terrified panic. You would think that something caught fire with the way I was yelling (which is what my roommate said he thought had happened), but no, just cockroaches. Tiny, $25 freaks of nature. Eventually I managed to eradicate most of the insect horde with stomping and shouting alone, at which point I grabbed a can of Raid from the laundry room and finished the job.\\n\\n\\nAt least, I *hope* I finished the job. I\\'m fairly certain there are at least two of those little fuckers still running around under the bed, but at this point I\\'m a little too emotionally drained to care. I also get the extreme pleasure of wallowing in the fact that I *basically* just paid $25 to get covered in my least favorite living thing on the planet. Jesus, it\\'s only 3 in the afternoon and I already need a stiff drink.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: I bought a used PS2 online, opened it up to fix it, and got covered in cockroaches.\\n\\nEdit: Hi, Reddit! I just wanted to say many thanks for the gold AND all the offers for cockroach-free PlayStations!  warms my heart, and I\\'m super happy you guys enjoyed my writing as well. Happy Redditing! I teach sixth grade, and today was the first day of (virtual) school. In an effort to make things less boring, we played “two truths and a lie.” I gave the kids my example, which was: “I have two brothers. I’m from Texas. I love horror movies.” Unfortunately, I messed up my own directions and gave them two lies—the brothers and horror movies.\\n\\nFor inexplicable reasons, I just...rolled with it, only corrected the brothers thing, and the kids were delighted at my “cool hobby.” Now I have kids excitedly emailing me to ask about my favorite horror movies, and they’ve promised to make me some really fun artwork based on our (presumed) shared love of this genre. Apparently a middle-aged, mom-type teacher who loves horror movies is some kind of unicorn to them, and I don’t have the heart to correct them. \\n\\nI feel my only option moving forward is to just embrace the lie. To get started, I watched a shitty (yet still scary to me) horror movie on Netflix after school. Now Netflix is suggesting other horror movies which I’m afraid of based on the title and font alone, and I guess I’ll never sleep again.\\n\\nTL;DR: Lied to children; must quickly become an expert in a genre of movies I truly hate.\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks for the suggestions! I have a long list of movies get through now. I may end up writing this story for my students (and thus coming clean) when we study personal narratives later this year. Also, thanks for the awards! 10 days ago, my younger sister started developing a cough. Understanding I\\'d now need to shut myself in for at least two weeks, I set about getting a few supplies. Near enough everything was completely sold out online, however, I managed to find an amazon listing for 40pcks of ramen. Couldn\\'t believe my luck! All were sold out bar the spicy chicken flavour. Not a problem - I like a bit of spice. Without reading the ad, I purchased immediately using the buy now button, thinking I\\'d found the listing just in time...\\n\\nIt arrived a few days later and I eagerly grabbed a pack. I noticed it read 2x spicy on the front. No worries, as a Brit, a hot curry and a pint is pretty much a weekly occurrence from birth. I excitedly cook my first batch. Pouring the included sauce on I notice it\\'s blood red, thick and viscous. Once mixed In though it looks OK. The noodles smell great. Oniony, chickeny tomato like smell. Right up my street. \\n\\nI took my first mouthful and messily slurped up the noods, getting the sauce all over my lips. It tasted pretty g- OH MY GOD WTF THE PAIN!!???\\n\\nIt was IMMEDIATELY screaming hot. Intense heat within 2 seconds flat. I coughed, inhaling some of the oily sauce and having it stick to the back of my throat, making me cough more and more. I ran for the milk, which offered me only temporary relief. I suffered through and finished the bowl. By the end, I was crying, sweating, pouring out from my nose and had turned a lovely shade of red. I had a Google of the brand and it turned out these are the hottest ramen available on the market. A limited \"nuclear fire\" edition release with double the spice of their already extremely spicy \"fire\" ramen. Just the originals are so hot that it\\'s become a trend online to film yourself attempt to eat a single pack. I now have 39 more packs of the twice as hot kind to get through.\\n\\nI refuse to let these go to waste. I\\'m 5 packs in so far, each pack literally makes me cry. I sincerely regret panic buying. Let this be a lesson for anyone. Just shop normally and read things before buying them. Don\\'t be a twat like me.\\n\\nTldr: panic bought the hottest instant ramen on the planet in bulk without reading the product description. Now suffering greatly for my stupidity. 35 packs of suffering left.\\n\\nPs. My sister had a common cold, nothing to worry about. :)\\n\\nEdit: the noodles are samyang 2x spicy fire chicken ramyun. Alternatively, Google \"worlds spiciest ramen\"\\n\\nEdit2: Please, get out of my dm\\'s. I will NOT send noods.\\n\\nEdit3: Wow, apparently saying as a Brit I can handle spice makes about as much sense as saying as a fish I can handle dry land. Apologies for triggering the spicelords...\\n\\nEdit4: So you\\'re saying ketchup ISN\\'T spicy????\\n\\nEdit5: I have started to piss streams of fire. Genuinely painful burning sensation up through the inside and tip of my wingly wangler. Who\\'d have thought that was a thing?? TIFU by dying in class\\n\\nI was in study hall yesterday morning, and I was hella tired cuz I had stayed up late the night before. So I put my head down on the desk and took a fat nap. Shortly after I fell asleep, my nose started bleeding. A lot. There was so much blood, it formed a massive puddle on the desk. \\n\\nEveryone else was gone at this point. My teacher is a G so he lets us play dodgeball during study hall from time to time. He figured I was really tired so he didn’t wake me up for it. \\n\\nEventually they all came back, and saw me with my head on the desk and a puddle of blood forming around it. They all started freaking out, and all the commotion woke me up. So then I sat up and I was like, “huh?”\\n\\nThe end\\n\\nTL;DR: fell asleep in class whilst everyone else was gone playing dodgeball, got a bloody nose, looked like I was dead when they all came back\\n\\nEDIT: did you die? Sadly, yes. But I lived This is like out of a damn cartoon.\\nA couple of days ago the cows in my village were going absolutely bonkers. Me not being able to sleep and having an exam in the morning had the billion dollar idea to take my most soundproof earplugs and go to sleep. I fell asleep in like 5 minutes. \\nI also like to set my ringtone to a very quiet bird noise so I dont wake up scared to death and stressed.\\nOf course, how I should have foreseen, I didn\\'t hear my alarm and overslept by three fucking hours. \\nWhen I woke up, my exam had been over for an hour.\\nNow this is not that big of a deal. I just have to get a doctor\\'s note and I can retake it.\\nSo off to the doctor\\'s office I go, trying to fix this mess.\\nI had to come up with a reason why I couldn\\'t go to my exam today. I told the doctor I had massive ear pain, a headache, and some nausea.\\nDoctor checked me and I ended up having an infected wisdom tooth. I just didnt notice it somehow. I had some pain here and there but it felt like it was coming out of my tempomandibular joint wich I have had problems with before.\\nAnyway at least I have my doctors note now. \\nFirst problem fixed.\\nI chose to get said wisdom tooth pulled because it was crooked anyway and the infection would probably reoccur.\\nMom drives me to the dental surgeon. I got drugged up real good.\\nTooth pulled, everything went fine.\\nGot in the car with mom, told her about every time I have done drugs, and about all of the gay sex i have had (she didn\\'t know I was gay). \\nNow I am in a shit ton of pain, my mom won\\'t look me in the eyes anymore, and I cant sleep because the cows are going insane again.\\nTL;DR: tried to bamboozle my doctor into giving me a doctor\\'s note because I overslept my exam, ended up having to get my wisdom tooth pulled and came out to my mother high of off my ass.\\n\\nEDIT: 1.this did not happen in one day. It was over the course of three days.\\n2.I will not use the enter button. Ever.\\n3. Earplugs are pura-fit moldex, work great if inserted properly\\n4. The drug was Triazolam\\n5. I barely passed the exam. It was math.\\n6. Some of the comments will look real stupid now So this started 2 weeks ago\\n\\nI went to my mom\\'s house for holidays just left today, so my younger brother(17) still lives with my mom. Doing the basic family reunion stuff catching up bugging my brother about women, when to my surprise he announces he had a GF.\\n\\n Naturally I start being an asshole and bugging him about the fact that she doesn\\'t exist, very cliche stuff. I get to teasing him about him not losing his V card, my mom is not liking the conversation. His gf ends up coming over, I stopped the teasing I\\'m not a monster. So I\\'m talking to his gf getting to see why she is with my brother, she\\'s a half decent girl says she\\'s throwing a party but my mom is being a stickler and not letting my brother go. I tell her not to worry about it I\\'ll talk her into letting my brother go out.\\n\\nI get to talking to my mother about how she should let him go, she is being very defensive. My argument was the fact that she sheltered him a little too much, we were raised Ying and yang I grew up partying, doing drugs, teenage gang stuff. He grew up in his bedroom talking to his friends, nothing wrong with it but little to no face to face. Saying how a party would be good for him I even offered to go, (I\\'m only 23) she was worried about if he had sex and what not, I told her he\\'s old enough she brought up that she had me when she was 17, and didn\\'t want him to make that mistake (I know how that sounds). So I finally convinced her she agreed.\\n\\nSo I decide that I need to give my lil bro the wrap your willy speech, he is super awkward about it. I knew my bro was losing it that night. Fast forward to the party, I drop him off so my mom thinks Imma be there. I pick him up he is grinning ear to ear. Bring him home and my mom is not happy with me appearntly her friend saw me at a bar, interrogation begins, he\\'s hung over not wanting to answer. \\n\\nSkip to  yesterday, his gf tells him she\\'s pregnant and going to keep it. Well holy fuck did I get reemed out, appearntly she convinced him to go in raw and make her a toaster stroodle. Well as you would all expect a virgins pullout game is not strong, but he has some strong swimmers.  So now my mom is pissed and blaming me, my brother is becoming a father, and I\\'m becoming an uncle.\\n\\nTL;DR Convinced my mom to let my brother go to a party and lose his V card, he got his gf pregnant. \\n\\n\\nUpdate 1: So she is swearing up and down she has not slept with anyone else, she agreed to a paternity test. So we gotta wait a bit for her to get it. I\\'m on the same thought train of all of you thinking they were getting frisky for awhile, they have been together for 2 months. My brother is getting tested for STI\\'s I was all over him about that. Also thanks for the gold and silver (I have no idea what that does). Thank you all for the input and advice, and compliments of my writing. \\n\\nUpdate 2: Everyone is asking for an update, can\\'t really give one we have to wait for her to be farther along for a paternity test. My brother does not have any STI\\'s or STD\\'s my mother is still being unreasonable and blaming me for this,I\\'m helping him look for work if it does turn out to be his. There are quite a few of you wondering what the \"teenage gang stuff\" was you can DM and I can explain what I did if curious, how I got out, how my life has changed and all. \\n\\nUpdate 3: *in Maury povich voice* the test results have come back and you are the father! Mother is crying brother is in shock and the GFs family is trying to convince her to get an abortion. Everyone pray for this child. \\n\\n\\nUpdate 4: They are keeping the kid, mom still doesn\\'t talk to me, I helped my brother get a job, and helping him graduate highschool. I\\'ve started a savings account for him, and my GF and I are going to move into a place with him and his GF to help them out. I work as a waiter in the biggest restaurant of my city, and today the mayor came here for dinner with his friends and his wife\\n\\nHe drank alcohol for all the time, and at the end he was drunk as fuck (when he is perfectly lucid he acts like a moron, so imagine how he could be a prick when drunk)\\n\\nAt the end of the dinner, after hours passed insulting me and my co-workers, he asked for the fruit and said: \"garçon, we want watermelon and you better hope it tastes good\"\\n\\nI said ok and I brought the watermelon, he tasted it and he said \"it tastes like dick\"\\n\\nAfter saying that, he assumed an arrogant facial expression and a stupid smile, and I literally lost my ability to be calm and patient\\n\\nI just wanted to jump on the table and slap him \\'till I was out of strength, but I couldn\\'t\\n\\nMy brain took control and said without my consent \"so you ate a dick?\"\\n\\nThe sad thing is that nobody laughed and I lost my job, but I was underpaid anyway.\\nHe lost his mind and he literally shout \"I\\'m gonna talk to your boss and after that you won\\'t be able to pay for a piece of bread\". I may be unemployed, but I\\'m happy\\n\\nTL; DR: I work as a waiter and the city mayor came here for dinner. He acted like a prick for all the time, treating me like a slave. When I brought the fruit to his table he said \"it tastes like dick\" and I answered \"so you ate a dick?\". At the end I lost my job, but at least I have happiness now... My Girlfriend and i love to try a lot of weird sex-stuff to keep things spicy. Yesterday she came along with a balloon fetish she read something about.\\nThis does not push any boundaries for wither one of us, so we sat down, had a lot of tequila and blew up some balloons. At one point our inner children came to shine and we just bashed each other with them, some occasional tickling, her screaming and one or another balloon popped. I\\'ll spare you further details, since I\\'m sure you get the idea.\\n\\nFast forward to when we were done.\\n\\nWe\\'re not tired yet, so we start up some streaming page and watch a movie. after like 5 minutes there is a blast, like someone hit the side of our building with a car, and again and again. i quickly grabbed my underwear from the floor and put them on while drunkenly moving towards the door to check what the hell is going on. I\\'m still one room from the entrance, but have a line of sight when the door blasted open and a Special Forces Police Unit team of 6 stormed into our apartment.\\n\\nwell.. i was standing there, in my undies and deaddrunk. my GF naked in the bedroom even more drunk.\\nI\\'m doing some occasional artsy craft, and from a sale I got to own about 7 completely disassembled mannequins and baby dolls. For a lack of proper storage they\\'re cutrently spread throughout the apartment. It kinda looks like a cheap horror movie at the moment.\\n\\nSo I was laying there, face down and surrounded by taped babydolls and limbs of mannequins. That for sure does not look good. They put a hood over my head and brought my girlfriend and me to the police station for questioning\\n\\napparently someone heard her screaming and the bangs and thought someone was murdered\\n\\nWell.. I just came home from the police office where I got laughed at for this story and I thought it might give you a good laugh as well.\\n\\nTL;DR spicing up sexlife with things we found on the internet lead to Special Forces Police Unit kicking in our door\\n\\nEdit: it seems important to mention that I\\'m not based in the US\\n\\nEdit2: yes this happened. i was there when it did. here\\'s the door with one of my babydoll projects in the background: http://imgur.com/gallery/U34z3OG\\n\\nEdit3: police paid for the door. carpenter will come in on monday\\n\\nEdit4: the hood was to protect the identity of the Police Unit since they also do a lot of undercover shit Happened this morning, about 5 hours ago. \\n\\nI was on my way to work, following a guy towing a trailer behind him. I noticed some sparks coming from somewhere underneath the trailer.\\n\\nNormally, I wouldn\\'t think twice about it, but I was having an especially good morning and wanted to help. Plus he was hauling a decent sized excavator and didn\\'t want something to happen to it, because it looked pretty new. \\n\\nWe pull up to a stop light, and I hop out of my truck to run up to him and let him know. Apparently he didnt see me, because when I said excuse me (his window was open) he turned and punched me in the jaw. \\n\\nBeing one who didn\\'t want to escalate the situation, I let him know about the trailer and proceeded to apologize for scaring him. \\n\\nAs I turned around to go back to my truck, the light turned green. The way this intersection is, there is the lights we were waiting at and another light 50 back down the road to tell incoming traffic what the light is, as it\\'s somewhat if a blind curve. \\n\\nAs I\\'m walking back to my truck, a woman comes around the corner and slams into the back of my truck, pushing it forwards into me. It didn\\'t move very fast, but hit me hard enough to knock me over and crack a few ribs. \\n\\nShe then gets out and yells at me for being stopped at the intersection as I\\'m laying on the ground in quite a bit of pain. The way she viewed it, I was an 18 year old kid who got out of my truck to do something stupid. \\n\\nThe cops got there and she got cuffed after trying to assault one of the officers. \\n\\nTL;DR I stopped to tell someone about a chain dragging under their trailer, got punched in the jaw and hit my my own car\\n\\nEdit: to all the people saying trucks often drag chains, this wasn\\'t a semi or tanker truck. It was just a couple dudes hauling their excavator to a dig site in a ford F-350 I\\'ve been a self-employed confectioner for the past two years and I recently started trying to get back into one of those fancy jobs with an office thingy again. I should also mention that for almost ten years I\\'ve used the same handle across multiple social media platforms. It\\'s by no means a secret identity, but it\\'s also not explicitly connected to my real name. Or so I thought. I had been happily emailing my resume and cover letters to many potential employers when I received this email from one that I was particularly excited about:\\n\\n***I have to say when \"Titty Boobowitz\" appeared in my inbox I got quite a chuckle, and had to figure out where that came from!  Your twitter profile is great - so much personality!***  \\n\\n***I look forward to reviewing your application and will be in touch shortly.*** \\n\\nOoops. My stomach fell right out of my ass when I read that. And of course the most recent thing I had tweeted was just a stream of swear words. I tried to do damage control, but I did not have high expectations. Today I finally received the follow up \"you\\'re not moving on to the interview process\" email.  \\n\\nTL;DR: Somewhere along the line while I was connecting social media accounts to my email, my real name was changed to Titty Boobowitz in gmail and I never noticed. Then I attempted job hunting. No wonder I got no responses.\\n\\nEDIT: Just because I didn\\'t make it clear - I emailed a gracious response to the person who does the hiring to let her know that it was my unintentional, embarrassing oversight and I appreciated the heads up. We had a warm back and forth, it was a positive experience overall. I\\'m relieved to know that this kind of thing happens to TONS of idiots like me. At least I didn\\'t put \"attention to detail\" anywhere in my resume. \\n\\n Sorry for the length and formatting. On mobile. \\n\\nTLDR; I ignored the warning of a friend about a guy who asked me out, I lived to regret it\\n\\nThis happened in 2008, shortly after I got stationed in South Korea (Republic of Korea, officially.) \\n\\nI was a lowly private, albeit a reasonably attractive woman in my early twenties. I was out one night with some friends, when a tall, funny redhead guy, who happened to be one of my friend\\'s soldiers, asked to take me out to dinner. \\n\\nFriend told me it was a bad idea. I asked why, but he wouldn\\'t give me details. My exact words were \"what\\'s the worst that could happen, I get a free meal and we don\\'t click?\" \\n\\nAs you may have guessed, this was not, in fact, the worst that could happen. \\n\\nThe following evening, we were supposed to meet at the taxi stand outside post, but he was late. He calls to tell me he\\'s at the ATM and ask if I have cash for the taxi. Not a great start, but, sure, I can spring for the taxi. \\n\\nHe gets to the taxi stand, we ask the Korean taxi driver, in our mash of Korean and English, to take us to the nearby Air Force base, which houses the only Chili\\'s on the peninsula. Something to the effect of \"Adishe, Osan ka-ju-sai-oh\" (Sir, take us to Osan, please.)\\n\\nWe\\'re going through back roads, and I ask what he thinks of Korea so far. He starts going off on a rant about how \"these people don\\'t even speak English\" and I must have looked at him like he had lost his mind. As I open my mouth to speak,  a little boy loses his ball and runs into the street to get it. This set Red off all over again, talking about \"these people have no common sense!\" and just really racist, weird and out of touch comments. \\n\\nWhen he finally takes a breath, I remind him that we\\'re in their country, not the other way around, and that everyone\\'s been really respectful, so I\\'m not sure what his problem was in the first place. He gets mad, and puts his headphones on, not saying another word to me the whole way to Osan. \\n\\nWhen we finally pull up to Osan Air Force Base, I lean forward to pay the driver, and he says, in perfect English with an American accent \"thank you, ma\\'am, that will be X amount of wan.\" and I could feel the blood rush to my face. Red does a double take at this man\\'s English and darts out of the cab. I apologize profusely, and the driver reminds me he speaks English, tells me he spent ten years in Chicago, and that he knows I wasn\\'t the one being awful. I tipped him as well as I could, thanked him, and apologized again. \\n\\nWe had to take another, shorter taxi ride once on base to the Chili\\'s. Red remained silent, and, not surprisingly, I paid for this one, too. \\n\\nRed, who is about 6 ft 2, dressed in baggy, bleach-white shoes, pants, t-shirt and baseball cap, decides to go to the restroom as soon as we\\'re seated. He comes back, immediately and loudly commenting on \"everyone\" staring at him. Trying to lighten the mood, I say that it\\'s strange how clear it is which guys are Army, and which are Air Force. He asks how I can tell, which is almost funny to me, and I use the phrase \"pretty boys\" to describe the AF guys, and say the soldiers all look a little tougher. He starts *yelling* actually *yelling at me* that if I like AF guys so much, I should go out with one of them. I just stared at him\\n\\nServer comes, I ask for a water- there\\'s no way I want to be drunk around this dude. He insists that the margaritas are the only reason to come to Chili\\'s, and orders one for me. The server is a young woman who looks at me nervously, but I just nod to let her know it\\'s fine. I ordered a Buffalo chicken salad, he orders two appetizers, beer and a steak. \\n\\nI had one sip of the margarita, and \"let\" him finish it, on top of the three or four beers he has. He snaps at the server, sends his food back, just everything he could have done. We don\\'t talk much. \\n\\nThe server brings the check and he says to her \"Oh we\\'ll split it right down the middle\" or something very clearly to the effect of I\\'m paying 50% of that number. She looks at me again, and I take the check from her. \\n\\nI am totally done at this point. \\n\\n\"Oh, if we\\'re going to split it, let\\'s split it! These beers are yours, the steak was yours, the appetizers are yours... technically the margarita was mine, even though you drank it, but I\\'ll take that and my salad, and you, *sir* can pay for the rest!\" The server is just standing there awkwardly staring as I finally raise my voice at this jerk. He opens his mouth to say something and I snap \"What?! Did I *miss something?!*\" and I hand her cash, as he hands her his card. \\n\\nHe didn\\'t even tip, but I did. (Off post, tipping is rude, but, frankly, she more than earned it.)\\n\\nHe was totally silent the entire ride back, which, of course, I paid for. \\n\\nI let his supervisor/my friend who had warned me know how it went down, and apologized for not heeding the warning. Somehow, at PT the next morning, Red had showed up in the wrong uniform and was smoked quite severely, I heard, but we never spoke again.\\n\\nEDIT: *Thank you* to everyone who has been kind in the comments. I didn\\'t think my default worst date story would cause this kind of ruckus. \\n\\nINFO: I was an Army medic, stationed on Humphreys at the time. *We were briefed that it was considered rude to tip servers in Korea.* At least one person with more personal knowledge than my own on the matter has clarified this in the comments. I was a server before joining, and strongly support people tipping their servers well and often where it is customary/necessary for them to pay their bills. &#x200B;\\n\\nSo some background: I\\'m a college student and due to the current situation I am using Zoom on a regular basis for all of my classes. Typically in my in person classes, I am usually just there and get my work done and leave, I usually just blend in and go under the radar in most classes.\\n\\nBasically, I have recently been seeing the memes and TikToks of students joining with funny backgrounds, and some are hilarious. So last night, I\\'m sitting in my room, bored, and decide I want to try some out for fun on my own Zoom call and see which one is the best. Basically, I found the best background to be [this one](https://imagez.tmz.com/image/12/4by3/2020/03/19/1231d07ca52a4a5ca98d72132a0c0e6f_md.jpg) and I\\'m just having a good time. I am thinking, “who could consciously join their class with something like this with your face and your name on it?” **Mind you, I am under the assumption that this simply stays in one call and goes away.** I am sure you can see the fuck up already.\\n\\nFast forward to this morning, I join my literature class for presentation day, and I am not paying any mind to my own screen as I am half asleep and just woke up for this. Suddenly the professor gasps and starts cracking up, as does everyone else, when the professor is like \"[/u/iamnotonaplane](https://www.reddit.com/u/iamnotonaplane/) WTF is that on your screen\", and I am like \"Whats what?\" when I open my own screen and see myself inbetween the legs of the one and only.\\n\\nTime to drop out.\\n\\nFML.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR accidentally joined my zoom call for my class with a large black dick in my background.\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks for the gold! So, the day started out wonderfully. I woke up around  half past six, went out to see that there is absolutely no one at the beach. I quickly ran downstairs, ate a bagle, while putting on my swim trunks. Looking at the clock in my living room I was happy with the amount of time it took for me to get ready and rushed off to the beach. \\n\\nOnce at the beach I took of my shirt and layed on the sand for a while. All that sun and the gentle rolling of the waves put me to sleep pretty fast. To my surprise I nodded off a fat one, three hours had past since I fell asleep. I was woken up by the screeching of seagulls and yawned while still laying on the sand. When suddenly something wet and mushy landed right in my mouth, yea that\\'s right a seagull shat in my open mouth. \\n\\nFour hours and 3 tubes of toothpaste later I can still taste the soury bitterness of the turd. \\n\\nTL;DR Yawned at the beach and a seagull shat in my mouth.\\n\\nEdit: Oh my, didn\\'t expect that this shitty story would blow up like this. Some say that that brings good luck, guess it brought me good karma, also thank you for my first award yay!\\n\\nEdit 2 lol: For all of you who were wondering if I got a sunburn. The sun here isn\\'t all that strong in the morning, so I got off without a sunburn. I am so beside myself with shame that I almost couldn’t bring myself to post this. \\n\\nBut reddit karma is my mistress and I must heed her sweet call. \\n\\nSo yesterday was my sister’s birthday (this fu didn’t happen today, yadda yadda), I was waking up from a dead, night shift worker induced sleep when my teenaged sister wandered into my room to proudly boast of her garnered treasures. \\n\\n“Look what mom gave me,” said my poor sister, unaware of what was about to happen as she placed a pretty little golden ring with her birthstone into my palm.\\n\\nNow, I cannot stress enough that what happened next took nothing more than a split second. I looked at that ring in my hand and I just got this image of me throwing back my head and swallowing the damn thing like a Bugs Bunny cartoon. My primitive ape brain said “funny joke!”\\n\\nSo I did it.\\n\\nI think it was the next split second when I saw the horror in my sister’s eyes and felt the ring slide past my gullet that I realized what a horrible mistake I had made. \\n\\nSo my little sister runs screaming from my room and I hobble out as well, head bowed in repentance and eyes brimming with shame as I admitted that I, a twenty year old grown ass woman, had swallowed my little sister’s ring. No, I didn’t know why I did it. Yes, I am an idiot. No one was amused and everyone was very mad, which is very understandable.\\n\\nSo brief intermission from my sister’s birthday as I make a quick excursion to the ER, where my story is once again not found funny by anyone and is met with either stern disapproval or a remarkable sense of passivity, like you could see in their eyes that they had seen endless shit and to them I was just a simple drop in the ocean of human stupidity. They took a couple X-rays and I hung around the ER for about 8 hours before they broke the news that I was going to live (much to my mother’s chagrin) and to go home and wait for nature to take its course. \\n\\nI shat out the ring this morning. \\n\\nHappy birthday sis. \\n\\nTL;DR: I am an idiot and I ate my sister’s ring because I thought it would be funny. \\n\\nEDIT: good fucking god my inbox. Tune in tomorrow morning and I’ll share a picture of the accursed ring\\n\\nEDIT 2: no, not a picture of it covered in shit.\\n\\nEDIT 3: front page!! We did it reddit. [Here’s the the divine artifact, as promised](https://imgur.com/gallery/PVA6Zvh). May it’s legend be told for many generations to come. \\n > So for a bit of a light hearted break from all those creepy incest  posts- this actually happened yesterday but I am ready to laugh about it  now.   \\n>  \\n>Theres  this other mom at my daughters daycare, and she is hot to trot. She  looks like a buff version of morena baccarin (sp?) and to top it off  shes super cool and fun to talk to. I don\\'t really know her outside of  drop off/pick up time but we\\'re always friendly and make basic chit chat  when we see one another- smile, say good morning, comment on parenting,  etc.  \\n>  \\n>Well  I recently had a pretty drastic schedule change at work and my husband  became the primary daycare drop off/pick up for about 2 weeks while we  all adjusted. Things settled down and I was able to start being the  primary again, and a few days ago I saw hotpants lady- she was still her  beautiful self, but had put on about 50lbs- I was astonished, she was  always ultra fit, how on earth did she do that in 2 weeks? To top it off  when I said hi the first morning I was back she barely made eye contact  with me and just gave me a half smile and curt nod. I asked my husband  if he noticed the change and he said he just thought maybe her recent  switch from workout clothes to big dresses were making her look bigger.  Maybe? No, she was definitely more voluminous. I spent 2 more days  trying to catch her eye and facing chilly disposition and I finally  decided to try and reinitiate friendly conversation with her.  \\n>  \\n>Me:  \"Hey, I haven\\'t been here for a while, good to see you again! You been  feeling ok?\" Her: \"Oh, yeah, but I haven\\'t been here in months.\" Me:  (not catching on) \"Oh? Haha, everything is such a blur with kids, I  never know what day it is anymore\" Her: \"I suppose, but I wouldn\\'t know,  I only watch my nephew when my sister is out of town.\" Me: (realization  hitting like a thunder clap) \"oh, OH! So you\\'re...\" Her: angrilly  interupting \"Yes, I\\'m the fat twin. I\\'ve seen you staring at me trying  to figure that out.\" She just sort of stalked off, leaving me mortified-  and now I\\'ve got to put my husband back on daycare duty for several  days to avoid the humorless wench who has clearly been eating all the  chips on her shoulder.  \\n>  \\n>TL;DR:  I didn\\'t see this sexy fitness goddess at daycare for a fortnight and  assumed she had put on an amazing amount of weight- only to be snapped  at by her plushy twin.  \\n>  \\n>edit: this sort of blew up and I realize I made some weird formatting error on mobile, making it hard to read- I hope I\\'ve fixed it! I work as a tutor for my university. This means a lot of students pop by asking for general academic assistance. \\n\\nThe place where I work is generally pretty loud, so it’s often hard to catch the student’s names. However, a nifty trick I’ve picked up is to look at the name that pops up on their computer log in when they open their laptops. \\n\\nThis usually works pretty well, but today was a completely different story. The student’s log in name was set to ‘Lenovo Signature,’ to which I thought, ‘huh, what an alternative name!’ \\n\\nI continued calling this student Lenovo throughout the entire tutoring consultation. (ie. “Yes Lenovo, that topic sentence is on point!”) \\nI got some funny looks from the student, but they didn’t correct me and were probably trying to be polite. \\n\\nThey left the consultation pretty damn quickly, and it wasn’t until my colleague pointed out afterwards (whilst in a fit of hysterics) that Lenovo Signature is a laptop brand. I had never heard of it before.\\n\\nI still haven’t recovered and will probably never show my face at work again. Lenovo girl, if you’re reading this, I am very sorry!\\n\\n\\nTl;dr: called a student the name of their laptop brand without realising that wasn’t actually their name. Happened about a week ago, but I\\'ve been hesitant to post this as I wasn\\'t sure if it really fits. No one involved in this story is a minor. Tl;dr at bottom.\\n\\nI am a freshman in college, and have fairly quickly settled in with a group of friends, which is awesome. There are about six of us, and we were all eating dinner in our university\\'s dining hall one night. We were just chatting when one girl went to show us a picture on her iPhone. She was scrolling through her camera roll when she suddenly recoiled and started nervously giggling.\\n\\n\"What?\" the collective asked.\\n\\n\"There\\'s some dude\\'s DICK here!\"\\n\\nWe gathered around her phone to see that indeed, there was a photo of a man\\'s penis, as well as a fully nude full body mirror selfie (notably, without face showing). We laughed about it for a second before trying to figure out how the hell the photos got there. We looked at the time it was saved to the phone, about noon, and figured out she was in class while it happened, so no one could have put them there when she wasn\\'t looking. We also realized it wasn\\'t a young body, it was a classic dad bod, and the guy was wearing a wedding ring. We couldn\\'t figure it out until something occurred to me.\\n\\nBefore I turned the setting off, everyone using my family iCloud account (my parents and brother) had access to my photo stream- they could see most of the photos I saved to my phone. This got annoying after my mom started questioning things I had saved (nothing bad, just weird memes or out of context texts from friends) so I turned it off.\\n\\nWithout thinking of the consequences, I asked her if she shared an iCloud account with anyone. She said she shared one with her parents. She got quiet for a moment before the realization hit the entire table.\\n\\nI\\'ve never seen someone go from laughing to crying so quickly. The rest of our group was silent for a minute until the situation was explained to the android users among us- that this poor girl had almost definitely seen her father\\'s penis. We sat there for probably another fifteen minutes trying to comfort her with an alternative explanation, but what can you say in a situation like that.\\n\\nThe image is burned into all of our minds. I\\'ve never met her father but I\\'m terrified one day I will, and that he\\'ll have a dad bod and a gold wedding ring and I\\'ll know exactly what his penis looks like.\\n\\nTl;dr: Friend found unexpected dick pic on phone, I can\\'t keep my mouth shut, told her it was near certainly her dad\\'s penis shared through iCloud, and now none of us are okay.\\n\\nEdit: Clarifying the tl;dr\\n\\nEdit 2, electric boogaloo: Why on earth is this on the front page of reddit. Also thanks for the silver\\n\\nEdit 3, freud enters the chat: Since like half of the comments are \"why would you cry from seeing your dad\\'s dick\":\\n\\n* We are all Americans and nudity, esp with your family, is more taboo for us\\n* We are assuming these were taken in a sexual connotation, which isn\\'t really how we like to think about our parents\\n* It wasn\\'t crying like OH MY GOD WHAT WILL I DO, it was more a mix of laughter and crying like \"I can\\'t believe this is what just happened\"\\n\\nEdit 4, the (provable) finale: I’m not posting a picture of this man’s penis you nasties (UPDATE AT BOTTOM!)\\n\\nThis happened yesterday. I can\\'t wait until it\\'s much further away than that.\\n\\nSo this is a throwaway, I have \\\\*(had) another account where I like to post nudes of myself. That can be your judgement, and why I do it is a whole other conversation, lol, but I do. As a straight guy who posts nudes, most replies I get are from guys. But occasionally I get replies from girls who frequent these subs. My face is never in the photos, nor anything very defining about my outer appearance. Just my... ya know, body.\\n\\nSo I had a girl reply to me a week or so ago from a throwaway account and we chatted and actually hit it off pretty well. Our conversation was sexual and non sexual, but was really fun. She said she had some nudes too but she didn\\'t want to post them, so our conversation moved from reddit. A lot of people in the \"nudes\" community use Kik, so that is what we used (no phone numbers exchanged).\\n\\nShe is from a large city on the other side of the country as I am, but conveniently I was traveling there next week (this week). We started sharing some fantasies and ideas about what fun it could be to actually meet up. She worked in a big corporate building, and told me she always had the fantasy of a delivery guy coming in, no words exchanged, and he would drop to his knees and lick her pussy and ass until she came, and then he would leave. This idea turned me on like crazy too, so we started to work out the logistics. We decided I would carry an envelope and say its for office \"XXX,\" she would already tell reception she was expecting this delivery and that she had to sign for it personally. No names needed.\\n\\nMost importantly we decided we weren\\'t going to exchange face photos...we had already shared WAAAY too much, and were super attracted to each other based on bodies and conversations. We literally shared dozens of nudes, even some videos. And lots and lots of dirty dirty sexting.\\n\\nSo along comes yesterday, the big day. I\\'m so worked up. She\\'s so worked up and sending me photos of where in her office this will happen, what kind of panties she wore today. Shows me that she is already masturbating. Etc. Oh lord, etc. I text her and tell her I\\'m in the building. I get to her office, my heart is racing but I\\'m beyond excited. I see the receptionist, tell her I need a signature from office \"XXX\" and she points me in the right direction. As I walk up, I see the name on the door. My cousins name. My first cousin, who I have known my whole entire life. My cousin, who I spend every holiday with and am very close with. It can\\'t be, I think.\\n\\nSo I knock and she says to come in, and, yes...it her. And she is obviously masturbating under her desk, assuming this \"guy\" was going to walk in. I just peak my head in, leaving my body and the envelope outside of the door and say \"Heyyyy Cousin, I was in town and thought I\\'d stop by!\" She is blushing bright red and obviously flustered and says \"OMG COUSIN!\" and gets up to hug me. I literally drop the envelope in the hallway and come in, and we have a really awkward conversation. She tells me she is about to step into a meeting, and to hit her up and we\\'ll get drinks that night.\\n\\nI race out, grab the envelope, go downstairs and delete all of my accounts. She surely thinks this guy ghosted her, I really don\\'t think she thought it was me. Maybe I read her face wrong, but her embarrassment seemed to be more about maybe catching her in the moment. I\\'m sure the receptionist told her that the delivery guy came, but maybe she just thinks there was a confusion with me sneaking in. I don\\'t know really though. I texted her later and told her I was too busy for drinks, but maybe tonight. We\\'re supposed to get a drink tonight. I\\'m petrified and don\\'t know how in god\\'s name I will be able to make eye contact with her.\\n\\n\\nedit:  It\\'s hard to reply to all of the comments, so I\\'ll say some stuff here.  She works for a very large company in a very large city.  She told me what floor to go, I honestly didn\\'t even pay attention to the company name when the elevator opened.    I DO know what company she works for, and its not hard to find the address if I wanted.  Like I said, it\\'s a big company, and not a shock that I could pop in.\\n\\nYes she is on reddit but I highly doubt she will see this post.  She told me she uses reddit for porn only lol.\\n\\n\\nedit 2:  Headed out for drinks now.  Wish me luck guys.  I think i’m going to be honest.  I don’t know.\\n\\nedit 3:  Well, first of all, Id like to address everyone calling BS on this.  It seems highly unlikely, implausible, and all of that.  I agree and would call BS reading this also.   I can’t really defend it or prove it (or can I?  if i can let me know how.  also this a throwaway, not sure what i get out of this karma?  let me know if you want my account or my gold lol, I could give a shit!)\\n\\n• She doesn’t have a reddit account, she just goes to porn pages with the r/subshelikestovisit.\\n\\n• She lives in NYC, it’s big.  The buildings are big and the company she works for has multiple offices and does many things. It didn’t occur to me, I guess I was worked up.\\n\\n• I come here often, it’s not that I didn’t call her, but sometimes when i’m here she’ll dm or comment on my insta story and say “hey come by and visit next time”\\n\\n• In our scenario setup she told me she would tell reception she was expecting a package that she needed to sign for.  There was no door man or anyone else I needed to get past.  I don’t know if that is weird in an office building but that is what happened.\\n\\n• We didn’t actually say “hey cousin” lol, i’m just censoring our names for the post.\\n\\n• Yes guys post nudes to reddit, I would mostly post to ladybonersgw, penis, and massivecock. (purposely not linked, check them out at your own risk/interest)\\n\\n• I’m 35, she’s 26.\\n\\n• I deleted my account after freaking out, but I’m sure I’ll post again and I’ll let you know lol.\\n\\n\\n\\noooookay, so now onto drinks.\\n\\nI decided to just come right out and tell her because i felt bad ghosting and also couldn’t fucking focus on anything else.  And as many of you guessed, she knew. She didn’t buy the “i just popped in”.  She figured it was me, asked the receptionist to confirm, and even worse, thought that I knew it was her all along and felt kind of gross.  I assured her I didn’t, it was really weird.  We slowly got past it and had our drink, and another, and got a little more comfortable and started to actually talk about all of the things we said and showed each other.  We complimented each other on our, assets lol, and realized freakiness must run in the family and shared stories we had heard about relatives over the years.  We talked about if we actually did anything, it’s a slippery slope, because we do see each other fairly often.  And then we had another drink.  And then I licked her pussy and ass in the bathroom of the bar.  I stroked myself while I did it, and after I made her cum she helped me out.  We promised we would never do this again, but I think we’ll get drinks one more time before i leave.\\n\\njudge away, people.\\n\\n\\ntl:dr - Post nudes on reddit, girl replies with elaborate sexual fantasy, go to act out fantasy and realize girl is my cousin. About two hours ago I was heading home with a bunch of shopping bags, and I saw a cat sitting in the corner of a side street, so I approached the cat and went \"psps hey baby!\", and I see a woman coming out of that side street. We lock eyes and I immediately say that I\\'m talking to the cat and point at the cat, only to do a half step on the sidewalk, twist my ankle, fall down, hit my right leg hard on the street (not sure exactly how it happened as I just ended up on my back with a lot of pain in my leg), with one of the bags I was holding ripping open and my things scattering near me.\\n\\nI heard laughter and a dude ran towards me and helped me get up while another collected my things and put them in the other bags for me. They made sure I was ok and left. Then I stood there in pain and extreme embarrassment for a couple of minutes.\\n\\nTl;dr I catcalled a cat, worried a woman would think I was harassing her, tripped, fell, got hurt and embarrassed. Obligatory this is a throwaway and this happened last winter yada yada yada.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI had this couple matched on tinder for a while, never messaged them before, never really cared for the idea but I still swiped out of boredom. They were listed about mid 30\\'s, and the woman was big, but had huuuuuuge boobs. Couldn\\'t see her face, but that didn\\'t matter to me. Only boob. There was no picture of her husband. I take a few shots and message them.  After like an hour of talking, I decide to just do it. We never traded any other pictures, the conversation was only about sex. She wanted me to have sex with her while her husband watched. At first I was like really not for it, I originally had no intention  of actually doing anything but more and more it didn\\'t feel like it was me at the wheel, and I was at the peak of not caring what happened to me, even if it resulted in something tragic. At 2AM I left the house, and this is where I regret everything.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAfter driving for about an hour, I miss their street  by a turn, and decide to turn back around through a parking lot, and while doing so drove over a curb that popped TWO of my tires. I\\'m in a shitty ghetto town that I\\'ve never been to, with two popped tires, not a fucking clue how I\\'m getting home now. I thought I was going to have to sleep in the car and call a friend and make up some story the next day. But since there was no turning back now, I decide to just walk the rest of the way to the couples house.\\n\\nThe husband is there waiting for me, and as soon as I see him, my gut and inner voice are SCREAMING at me, don\\'t do this, turn back. And I wish I had listened. For reasons unknown, I followed him into the house. It was pitch black, not a single light was on. He lead me down into the basement, unsurprisingly it reeks of must and beef stew. I was unsure if they were going to rob and kill me or if this was just normal to them. If there was ever a time I disassociated, it was then and there. It was no longer me behind the wheel. The dude leads me to their bed, and shines a flashlight on his wife. Does anybody remember the scene in Blade where he shines the light on that mega obese vampire? That was what I saw. A disgusting ogre wildebeest, with a crooked line of teeth. I was horrified but at the same time, I didn\\'t care. They both fucking STINK, that was one of the worst things. The smell took forever to wash off my hands after. Months later I\\'ll get a whiff out of nowhere. That disgusting beef stew and body odor smell.\\n\\nI take off my clothes and get in bed with her, meanwhile the husband is talking THE ENTIRE TIME, like fucking Gollum. Saying things like \"yeah it\\'s been a while since she\\'s had another. Look at that beautiful pussy. Ain\\'t she so fuckin wet?\" Nonstop. Meanwhile shining the flashlight on both of us to get a look. Like I said before, it didn\\'t feel like it was me at the wheel, I managed to perform to a degree but I never did finish. It probably didn\\'t help I was wearing a condom but I\\'m extremely glad I was. The entire time there\\'s about 5 different things running through my head at the same time.\"How the fuck am I getting home? This smell is going to kill me. How do I end this? How do I get out of here?\"\\n\\nI decided it was time, I had to get the fuck out of there asap. I told them I couldn\\'t cum, it wasn\\'t going to happen. They insisted I put it in her ass, and me being a polite dude, didn\\'t want to offend them, obliged. I just wanted to make it look like I at least tried. If the smell was bad before, it took on an entirely new dimension with the smell of shit burning the hairs in my nose. I pulled out and of course there was a fat wad of shit glued to the head of my dick. I stuck it back in to hopefully wipe it off inside her asshole and called it quits. I politely reiterated I wasn\\'t going to be able to finish. I blamed it on my tires being popped and I was too tired. They were cool about it, and I quickly gathered my things and left.\\n\\nI BARELY had the money for a tow truck driver to get home, and at least he got a kick out of the story. So we both had something to talk about for the hour long drive home. My hands reeked for at least another week, no matter how many showers I took and how many times I washed them. I blame it on a poor mental state with lack of self care for doing what I did. It took many months for me to even think about sex without being able to smell them. Easily the biggest regret of my life, and probably ruined sex for me for forever.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR; Drove an hour to pop both my tires in a shitty mystery ghetto town, then had traumatizing sex with a female version of Shrek while her husband shined a flashlight on us and muttered the entire time.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: I\\'m really glad I was able to make a lot of you laugh, even if it\\'s at my own expense, I\\'m laughing with you. A lot of you have kind things to say and it means quite a lot, thank you. I hope anybody that can relate to the self destructive mindset finds happiness. Obligatory this didn\\'t happen today. This is a project I\\'ve been working on for the past week, but the FU only became apparent yesterday.\\n\\nThe characters in this story are:\\n1. Me, father to a 16-month-old\\n2. My wife, mother to the same 16-month-old\\n3. Our 16-month-old\\n\\nFor the past couple of months, Kiddo has been saying \"Dada\" and \"Da\" quite a lot to refer to me. He says it when I walk into the room. He says it when he hears my car pull into the driveway. He says it when he wants my attention. A dozen times a day at least. Let me tell you, there are few pleasures in the world as great as coming home from work and having a toddler look at you and exclaim \"Da!\" with a huge grin on his face.\\n\\nNow, he\\'s said \"Mama\" and \"Ma\" before to refer to his mom, but it\\'s rare. I know she wishes he would more, and I want her to get that feeling as much as I do, so I decided that I was going to work with Kiddo on saying \"Mama.\"\\n\\nIn my 16 months of parenthood, I\\'ve learned that my kid picks up skills ok from watching and listening, but that they stick best when he learns by doing. With this in mind, I\\'ve been trying to get him to say \"Mama\" on his own accord. He has already demonstrated in the past that he knows his mom\\'s name is \"Mama,\" so I\\'ve been working with that. Whenever she walks into view, I\\'ll excitedly say \"who\\'s that?\" He basically never says that it\\'s \"Mama,\" but he does run over and give her a hug. At least there\\'s that, I guess.\\n\\nAfter a week of no progress, Kiddo came running into the kitchen yesterday morning, looked right at his mom, gave a big smile, and said, \"who\\'s that?\"  Ouch.\\n\\nMaybe he learns better by listening after all. \\n\\nTL;DR - My toddler now calls his mom \"who\\'s that?\" because I tried to teach him using the Socratic method. I guess this is more of a positive fuck up, but still a fuck up.\\n\\nAnyway, I\\'ve been smoking (just cigarettes) regularly for a bit over 4 years now. I really like smoking, it relaxes me, clears my head, and I love the taste of different tobaccos. Well, loved.\\n\\nI don\\'t smoke a lot unless I\\'m out with friends, which as you can guess it\\'s something that\\'s just not happening during this pandemic. As a result, I\\'ve spent the last month or so smoking just a couple of cigarettes a day, which really enhanced my sense of smell.\\n\\nWell a couple of weeks ago, I\\'ve had a terrible sore throat, to the point of not even being able to talk; smoking was out of the question, as it was simply too painful. My cravings were easy to manage, as I already didn\\'t smoke a lot.\\n\\nFast forward 10 days, I\\'m feeling alright again and I finally grab a cigarette. I light it up, inhale... And it tastes like absolute shit. It feels like I\\'ve licked clean my ashtray, nothing at all as what I\\'m used to! The smoke itself that\\'s coming from the cigarette has a barely tolerable smell, I just can\\'t stand it.\\n\\nSo here I am now, almost a week later. I\\'d really like to smoke, I loved it so much, but it\\'s just so disgusting I can\\'t bring myself to do it. I\\'ve tried, but it\\'s just horrible and the taste just seem to get worse. I had no plans to stop smoking anytime soon, this was 100% not intended and I\\'m actually pretty annoyed by it.\\n\\nI guess it\\'s good for my health and everything, but I\\'m probably one of the only idiots in this world that accidentally quit smoking. This whole thing sounds so stupid.\\n\\nEdit: holy hell somehow this reached r/all I’m getting a lot of comments and while I might not be able to reply to all of you, please know that I’m reading them all. With so many people sharing their positive experiences about quitting and showing support, I’m actually quite happy this happened to me now. I might be pissed off today but I’ll probably be happy about it in the long run. Thank you!\\n\\nEdit 2: I’ve literally just received the results of my Covid test: I’m negative!!! I saw a lot of you guys were worried since altered taste and sore throat can be Covid symptoms, so I thought I’d update on my test results here. No Covid for me, the cigarettes taste bad for real!\\n\\nTl;dr: Had a really bad case of sore throat that forced me to give up cigarettes for 10 day. Now they taste like absolute shit and I\\'m actually pretty pissed of because I had no intentions of actually quitting. This is a throwaway account, and this happened about two years ago. \\n\\nI was fresh out of high school (18F), and in desperate need of some funds. I already had a job that I didn’t make enough money doing, and I needed cash fast. \\n\\nNaturally I became a prostitute. \\n\\nI’m not one anymore but I used to average about 5 clients a week, and it was really good money. I actually ended up enjoying the job immensely. \\n\\nOne night I had a brand new client (35M) contact me and ask to meet up. I texted him my address and got ready. \\n\\nWhen he came over, i asked him what he wanted and how he liked it, all the usual questions. I started to undress him and make him comfortable, and soon enough I was on top, riding him. \\n\\nWe started to a bit rougher when all of a sudden there was a sharp extreme pain in my pelvis. I could barely breathe from the intensity of the pain. He asked if I was alright, and like straight out of a movie with the timing, I looked straight at him and just threw up all over him. \\n\\nHe pushed me off and was naturally very alarmed as I kept throwing up. The sheets, both of our clothes (and his very expensive leather jacket), and the area was just covered. He immediately asked if he should call an ambulance and all I could do was nod as I moaned in pain and kept throwing up. \\n\\nEventually I went to the hospital that night to find out that I had an ovarian cyst that ruptured. I was in the hospital for a week after surgery, being watched and on medication before I was able to go home. \\n\\nHe ended up texting me later on asking if I was alright. I apologized for everything, and told him that of course I would pay for the damage to his jacket and he didn’t have to send me anything. \\n\\nHe was such a sweetheart he still paid me, and he actually asked me out on a date which I said yes to. We don’t talk anymore but I’m very grateful for him. \\n\\nTLDR; I was a prostitute and threw up all over my client in the middle of sex. Ended up in the hospital with a ruptured cyst. So this happened last Sunday night.\\n\\nSo I was organizing the storage closet at my apartment, and pulled out a hard case containing my .308 bolt action deer rifle. I haven’t touched this thing since 2018 when I last took it to the range to sight in my scope. The storage room isn’t climate controlled, and the house is super old, so I decided to crack this thing open to make sure it’s still in good shape. \\nI laid it on the floor, opened the case, and cleared out the old paper target that was folded up in there. I came back and knelt down at the front of the case (I.e. the muzzle-like a dumbass), grabbed the rifle by the foregrip, and picked it up. The sling must have caught on the trigger, because it immediately went off and shot me through the thigh and dug a tract out of my calf. \\nFuck. \\nWords cannot describe the amount of fear and pain that coursed through me. I reached back and gently touched where my hamstring should be, and it felt shredded and wet. My ears were ringing so loud I couldn’t hear myself screaming “Oh fuck, I’m shot! Oh my God, I’m shot, call 911!”\\nMy ex gf was there getting some of her things-we had broken up days prior but remain friendly. As she was calling 911, I had enough composure about me to direct her to grab a tourniquet that I had from my Army days as a medic, put it high and tight in my groin, and immediately began losing motor function as I slipped in and out of shock.\\nI remember a few things from what ensued as emergency services arrived on scene. I remember the feeling of bones in my femur grinding together as they moved me onto a spine board. I remember being repeatedly shoved back down as I kept sitting up trying to assess the damage for myself. I remember my family being outside in a panic as they brought me outside to the ambulance and hearing the police tell them there was no time to speak to me because I was dying from blood loss, and that I’d be lucky to keep my leg.\\nThe rest of that night is a blur of narcotics and panicked health care personnel, and me holding the hand of a nurse who kept me reassured that I was going to live. \\nI woke up in another hospital after something like 6 hours of surgery where they drove a shaft up the length of my femur, followed my 3 screws to hold together what was shattered. I’ve had 3 surgeries this week to include a 7”x11” skin graft, and I am remarkably recovering well. \\nI have so much ahead of me in terms of recovery, and I am blessed to have the support of my family who completely packed up my apartment today, since it has stairs that I won’t be navigating any time soon. \\nI fucked up you guys. I am such a stickler about firearm safety and never carry a weapon with a round in the chamber, even when carrying concealed to prevent things like this from happening. My rifle didn’t have a magazine in it, the mag was loaded and packed in the case with my rifle. I should’ve never even been oriented at the muzzle of that weapon, but I got complacent. \\nMy message to everyone is this: firearms have a place as an important tool, but they are inherently hazardous as their only intended function is to maim and kill. With that being said, double, triple, hell clear your firearms as many times as it takes to make it a habit EVERY time you touch a weapon. Even if you briefly put it down, clear it again when you pick it up. Practice firearms safety 100% of the time because it only took a fraction of a second to really fuck me up and that could be you. Just please use my story as a lesson to encourage proper safety practices because this week has been the hardest, most painful days of my life. \\nThank you. \\n\\nTl;dr: shot myself in the leg with a .308 rifle because I had a lapse in safety and almost died. Please be safe with guns because if they hurt you it really fucking sucks.\\n\\nEdit: For those grilling me about storing a loaded gun, I never said I packed it up at the range. We were alternating between a few rifles and I didn’t go behind and open every case to double check that they were all clear once we got loaded up. Don’t be dicks about me making soldiers look bad or questioning my competence therein. I’m a responsible gun owner who made a mistake that anyone could have which led to an accident. I never even got the rifle in my arms to check it, which would’ve been my first move.\\n\\nEdit 2: No, you can’t have pics right now because it’s literally just one big ace wrap from hip to toes. I’ll see what I can do about getting you some pics of the X rays though, and if you guys are really into it, I’ll take one when they change my bandages. All I can say is that I had an entry hole the size of a golf ball. Some shit band aids can’t fix.\\n\\nEdit 3: Picture from my dressing change today. This is the most that the doctor would let it be exposed without setting up a sterile field. I’m hooked to a wound vac, and we’re just trying to keep everything clean while it heals. \\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/vi8LBYy This happened last month during a staycation in the U.K. with my (25M) girlfriend’s (25F) family. \\n\\nMy GF, her mum and her sister decided to go shopping for the day. Her dad, sister’s boyfriend and I headed for the pub. We were about 3 pints in when the FU began.. \\n\\nGFs Dad: “OP, how long have you and my daughter been together now?”\\n\\nMe: “Almost 6 years”\\n\\nGFs Dad: “Wow, that long already. No 7 year itch yet?”\\n\\nHere is where it started to unravel. I couldn’t recall the exact meaning of the phrase “7 year itch” but i thought it was meant to be a tongue in cheek question, basically asking if my GF was getting impatient about when I was to propose and when we would get married. \\n\\nExcept, It doesn’t mean that at all. \\n\\nMe: “Yes, in fact, I have been thinking about it more and more recently and I expect it to be on the cards soon. Of course, when the time comes, I will ask for your blessing.”\\n\\nMy GFs dad choked a bit on his beer and stared at me blankly, visibly uncomfortable. I smiled and took another sip of my beer. We finished up, and headed home. \\n\\nAfter dinner that night, I asked my GF if her Dad was okay as he seemed off with me. I briefed her on the conversation in the pub. She stopped me halfway through, with a huge grin on her face, struggling to contain her laughter. \\n\\nShe went on to explain that the phrase “7 year itch” is in fact a saying or popular belief that after 7 years, a relationship or marriage declines and often results in one of both parties having an affair. \\n\\nSo in essence, I told my girlfriend’s father that I had been thinking about the decline of our relationship and when the time came, I would be asking his blessing to sleep with other women. \\n\\nThankfully, my future in- laws are good people. Once I explained my FU and apologised, they laughed it off and we forgot about it :)\\n\\nTL;DR \\n\\nI misunderstood a common phrase and effectively told my girlfriend’s father that our relationship was in peril and I would be asking his blessing to have an affair.\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nWow this blew up! Thank you kind strangers for the awards and all the wholesome comments. Just to clear a couple things up.. \\n\\n1) There are a few people calling me out and calling me an arsehole for wanting to ask permission to marry my girlfriend. First of all, I would like to say this is a common and traditional practise in the U.K. one which I don’t particularly agree with. That said, my girlfriends family are very traditional people and would likely be offended if I didn’t ask. I am going to respect their traditions, even if I don’t agree with them. My girlfriend is fully aware of this and agrees it is the right thing to do.\\n\\n2) Many people have questioned why the hell my girlfriends dad would ask that and they are trying to somehow psychoanalyse the situation. I have known my girlfriends dad for many years, we are good friends and often go to the pub, watch football etc. He didn’t ask the question seriously and was joking. I think it was meant rhetorically and my response took him by surprise (probably the stupidity of it) and was trying to make sense of it before the girls turned up shortly and we had to leave.\\n\\n3) I have changed “permission” to “blessing” as it has been pointed out that the former implies it’s ultimately the decision of her parents, which it isn’t. Thanks to those who pointed this out :) Obligatory this happened over the course of a few days, ending a couple days ago\\n\\nSo I was on a certain adult website having a browse of certain adult products, ended up popping some stuff in my cart until I hit the free postage amount. I was pleasantly surprised when I was offered 20% off as a new customer, and applied the discount. However, this then took me below the amount I needed to get free postage. So I decided to get one more thing to push me back over that limit. \\nI did not know how far I had pushed the limit until it was too late.\\n\\nI kept browsing and then decided I would get a new buttplug, maybe a slightly bigger one than current just to try it. I found a reasonably priced one in 3 sizes, 3.5 inches, 4 inches and 4.5 inches. I, the anal NOOB that I am, assumed this was in reference to LENGTH. So I clicked on the largest one to add to cart, because you know, new experience, the length doesn\\'t seem that bad, worth a try.\\n\\nFast forward a couple days and my delivery arrives! I\\'m excited, I don\\'t know what\\'s coming. I wait for my partner to get home and we unbox it together. It\\'s all fun and games and lighthearted until...\\nWe unearth a MONSTROSITY of a buttplug, it is quite literally the SIZE OF MY HAND. Theres a stunned silence before I rush to explain this was an ACCIDENT and all my partner can do is crack up. (No pun intended). I tore off the packaging incase it was some sort of optical illusion making it look bigger but NO ITS JUST MASSIVE AND IT IS GOING NOWHERE NEAR MY SCARED AND NAIVE BUMHOLE.\\n Hope this brings you all more joy than it brought me. Honestly the best part of this is I now have an interesting story to post on reddit.\\n\\nTL;DR -  I\\'m out a bit of money, own a MASSIVE buttplug and have caused a small injury to my partner when I jokingly threw it to him and the WEIGHT OF IT CAUSED HIM PHYSICAL PAIN. Normally, students can beep into my school with an ID card.\\n\\nIt\\'s RFID, and pretty reliable, so most people don\\'t take their card out of their wallet or purse, they just hold it near the waist-height reader, wait for the beep, and the turnstile unlocks.\\n\\nI\\'m a junior, and I\\'ve been getting into the building the same way for years. I keep my ID Card in my back pocket, so I just bump my butt up against the reader, and then side-step through the turnstiles. That sounds a little weird to write, but I promise it\\'s easy to do in one smooth motion, and I\\'m definitely not the only girl who gets in this way.\\n\\nOnly issue was today, when the turnstile broke and wouldn\\'t lock. As a temporary fix, the security guard was standing by the turnstile in front of the reader, and we were supposed to have our ID out to show him as we walked in.\\n\\nComing in at 8:00AM, after years of habit... I was on autopilot.\\n\\nI approached the security guard, he said, \"ID?\" and I nodded at him... and turned around, bumped my ass up against his crotch... and then did it again, slower and more forcefully. (Obviously I didn\\'t hear the beep, so I guess my brain thought I wasn\\'t close enough to the \"reader\"?)\\n\\nIt all took about two seconds, and when I felt his crotch against my ass instead of the metal turnstile, I suddenly realized what I was doing... but before I could say anything, he had taken a huge step back and started going all \"Woah woah woah! Miss! I just the need the ID, please, not a lap dance!\" and then turned up to the security camera with his hands in the air like he wanted it on record he didn\\'t cause this.\\n\\nI tried to explain, but he wasn\\'t willing to listen, telling me to just go in... and that\\'s that. Couple of other students saw so I\\'m waiting for the rumor-mill to get back to me.\\n\\nTL;DR: Decided I could bribe my way into school without an ID by giving the security guard a lapdance... I was right. This morning I was out for a walk with my two dogs. Now it\\'s important for context that you understand how pretty my dogs are. They are both rescue husky mixes that look fairly unusual and have really beautiful blue eyes. It\\'s not out of the ordinary for people to stop me and ask about them, compliment them, and want to pet them. Having these ridiculously gorgeous dogs has somewhat desensitized me to people yelling out of car windows and across streets because maybe three times a week someone will yell a dog-compliment at us.\\n\\nSo we were walking along the sidewalk when a man working on some new construction across the street yelled, \"Oh my God, I love your doggers!\" \\n\\nI gave him a big smile and yelled back, \"Thanks! Wanna say hi?\" He looked slightly surprised but smiled and started walking over. When he crossed the street he was suddenly acting a bit awkward and not really paying much attention to the dogs. I had them sit so maybe he\\'d feel comfortable petting them, but honestly I was getting a weird vibe now and wanted to get on my way. We then had the following interaction: \\n\\nHim: So do you want to give me your Snap? \\nMe: Um, no thanks. You can say hi to them here, and I\\'m going to get going. \\nHim: Here? You just wanna... *mimes pulling down a shirt*\\n\\nHere\\'s where I realize all at once that I\\'d fucked up. I had been desensitized by years of dog-compliments and am now putting the pieces together that this man had very-likely catcalled me and I was basically a cat-callers dream, friendly and receptive to his advancement by smiling and inviting him over to say hi. My mind locked on to what he had originally yelled. \\n\\nOh my God, I love your doggers!\\n\\nI love your doggers!\\n\\nDoggers!\\n\\nFinally, my dumbass brain puts the peices together and I squeak out a horrified, \"Did you say you love my knockers?\" He nods yes and I wish I could say I had some cleaver retort, but honestly I just gave him a firm point of my index finger and an exasperated, \"no!\" before the pups and I hightailed it outta there. \\n\\n\\nTL:DR I thought a random man was complimenting my dogs. Invited him to come say hi. Turns out, he was cat-calling me.\\n\\nDog tax: http://imgur.com/gallery/ExbqwCx I’m still trying to process what just happened. Today was my daughters 19th birthday and I wanted to surprise her by coming home early with a cake. I brought the cake home, slowly tip-toed to her room to surprise her and heard something I will never unhear. She was having sex with her boyfriend and saying “please stop it hurts, stop it.” I ran in, screamed for him to stop and pulled him off my daughter. I was shouting at him and my daughter was mortified and screaming at me. I threw him to ground and accidentally knocked him unconscious. My daughter was frantically explaining to me that it’s a fetish and he wasn’t actually hurting her. I told her to get dressed, found a blanket to wrap her bf in and I rushed him to the hospital. He’s doing okay now and isn’t suffering any major injuries but I feel awful. I’m not an aggressive person but it was my daughter and I truly thought he was hurting her.\\n\\nTLDR; mistook my daughters fetish for her bf hurting her and knocked him unconscious\\n\\nEdit: I’m her strong mom 😆\\n\\nEdit: Wow this blew up. Thanks everyone for the nice messages, advice, and sweet comments. I haven’t been able to get through it all but I will, and I’ll reply to whoever I can. It’s currently 3am and I just cooked him some food and I’m going to visit him and my daughter at the hospital. His parents live out of town and want to visit tomorrow. Please pray for me. TIFU by giving my old sports car to my stepson (16), instead of my actual son (20) who wanted it since he was a child.\\n\\nThis happened last year, but yesterday I got a grim reminder.\\n\\nBefore we start off with this trainwreck of a story, here is some background information.\\n\\nI\\'ve been a car mechanic since the age of 19 and I have my own garage/store since I was 28 years old.\\n\\nAfter my first marriage went to shambles, I remarried a few years later. Just like my current wife, she had a son from her first marriage. My stepson was around 4 years old back then and he sees me as his real father, seeing his own father walked out on him.\\n\\nMy son from my first marriage was living with his mom, but I saw him quite often shop was on his way back from school, he dropped by occasionally to say hello or look at the cars I had in the shop. My wife and ex-wife actually got along well, there was never any issues with my son staying over or staying for dinner, he lived with his mom though.\\n\\nWhen I turned 17 my dad bought me a black Chevrolet Chevelle SS, through my entire live I\\'ve always taken care of that car. I loved that car to dead, 90% of that car is still consisting of it\\'s original parts. Seeing I\\'m a mechanic I had no issues doing everything myself, this car was standing in front of my shop most of the time or in my garage at home. My son, loved this car as well. He always wanted to go along for rides and he knew everything about it. He even had a small model car that looked just like it.\\n\\nSo, where did it go wrong you wonder? My ex-wife remarried as well 8 years ago, but they moved a few states away seeing her new husband got a new (and better paid) job offer. After that, I spoke to my son mostly on the telephone and saw him maybe once every 3-4 months for a long weekend or half a week. The phone calls became less frequent and he said he wanted to focus on his schoolwork. Seeing he was a teen and I couldn\\'t blame him for that. My stepson was already 10 at that time. When my son was 16 he went to univeristy a few states away, I barely had time to speak to him or to see him, my business was doing bad at the time and my wife had also gotten really sick at the time with E. coli and got kidney failures. It was a tough time keeping everything together, but somehow we made it through all of it and my wife is doing far better now.\\n\\nFast forward to april 2019, my stepson was turning 16 that month. My stepson always got on with my son, so he invited him. My son was busy at the time, but promised he would show up a few days later. After all that happened I didn\\'t see him for almost 4 years, so I was glad he was coming over. Now here comes to part where I fucked up badly. My stepson was a grade A student, even when times where tough he managed to get good grades at school and even got into the university where he wanted to study Medicine. My wife and I where so proud of him. So I decided to give him my old Chevrolet Chevelle for his 16 birthday.\\n\\nHe was pretty amazed by it and so were his friends, it\\'s a car that to this day still makes an impact. It so on my son as well, one that would cost my relationship with him.\\n\\nI texted him a picture of my stepson with the car on his 16 birthday party, not knowing what would happen next. My son texted me back with \"Is this a joke?\"\\n\\nI didn\\'t understand at the time and texted him back with \"No, why?\"\\n\\nHe called me not a few seconds later, yelling at me to tell him that it was a joke.\\n\\nHe told me that I promised him the car when he was 10 years old, that if he did well in school I would give it to him. The part that made me yell back at him through the phone was when he called me a \"louzy father that didn\\'t care about his real son\", let me tell you things were said from both sides that weren\\'t nice from that point onwards.\\n\\nMy wife told me to calm down and to talk it out because there was some misunderstanding.\\n\\nI then did the most regretabble thing I\\'ve done and If I could take it back I would do it, I told my son in a fit of rage that \"he didn\\'t deserve the car\" and that he could call me back if he changed his attitude. After I hang up the phone, I got into a fight with my wife, who stood up for my son. At that moment in time I didn\\'t care, I was insulted for being called a bad father.\\n\\nI tried to contact my son a few days afterwards, but I wouldn\\'t get any response. I think he changed his phone number a day after the fight. I couldn\\'t care any less at the time.\\n\\nThree weeks later my ex-wife called, furious as hell. My son had apparently gratuated from University and I was (in hindsight) not invited by my son. My ex-wife already found it strange that I wasn\\'t there, my son told her there and then what happened and that he wanted to invite me on the day he would come to visit for his graduation. The worst thing is, he was graduating as an automotive service technician and was apparantly one of the best in his class. I then realized that I was indeed, a bad father. In those 4 years of not seeing him and all the stress around me I didn\\'t even bother to ask what he was studying. My ex-wife told me that he was heartbroken and felt like he was unwanted unlike my stepson. She started crying on the phone, saying he just wanted to be a mechanic just like you. He apparently wanted to move back and work with me in my shop and take over when I was going to retire. My entire world crumbled up in front of me, I felt and still feel so encridibly stupid for saying those things to him. My ex-wife wouldn\\'t give me his new number and adress, seeing he wanted no contact with me ever again. She also told me to never reach out to her ever again.\\n\\nIt\\'s been more then a year now, I\\'ve had a few fights about it with my wife. My stepson gave the car back and settled for something else if it ment that my son would come back.\\n\\nI\\'ve tried getting into contact with him for the last 11 month\\'s. Until a few months ago the last thing I found out that he was probably working for some big car manufacturer, but they didn\\'t want give out any information about the people working there.\\n\\nYesterday I got a package from him, unexpectedly.\\n\\nIt didn\\'t come with a letter or return adress on it, but I knew it was from him.\\n\\nIt was a box with his old Chevrolet toy car, an old picture ripped up of him and me on the hood of the car and a videotape. I watched the videotape, he was probably seven years old at the time, in the video I was fixing a car. I cried halfway through this, because I then knew why he mailed me the tape.\\n\\nI said to him while he was filming it, if he wanted and kept up his grades that the shop could be his one day including my Chevie.\\n\\nTLDR: I didn\\'t keep my promise to my son and gave away my sports car to my stepson.Things were said and now I will never see him again.\\n\\nEdit: a part I left out\\n\\nEdit 1: Some of you didn\\'t clearly read everything and that\\'s okay. I would be mad to while reading this. My stepson is not to blame here, he gave back the car and the car is now stored in a garagebox. This car has become a thorn in my eye and I can\\'t look at it tbh.\\n\\nEdit 2: Me and family tried to search for him on facebook and all the other popular social media apps, seeing how he never was into any of those we couldnt find anything.\\n\\nEdit 3: I\\'ve been searching for him for quite some time already. If this virus clears out I can travel to some states to see if he actually lives or works there.\\n\\nEdit 4: After actually contacting my ex-wife a few times over the course of months, she told me half a year ago that she would ask him once to contact me. But she couldn\\'t force him to if he didn\\'t want to.\\n\\nEdit 5: Some of you have reached out to me, I\\'m grateful for the help from some of you to try to help me track him down. But as you can understand I can\\'t give out personal information about myself or my family and my son. There is already to much at stake.\\n\\nEdit 6: Deleting this account. I know a lot of you people are angry. Believe me I know the feeling, I hate myself as well. I came here to share a story of how I fucked up badly, hoping some people maybe would learn of it. But the nasty messages and death threats I\\'m receiving in my inbox from other car enthusiasts and other upset people are really not worth it.   \\nFrom one worthless father to any father or future one, please learn from my mistake. Happened just now. Sorry for my possible slips as English is not my mothertongue. I mostly only lurk around, but this time I decided that it\\'s something worth sharing, given the spirit of the sub.\\n\\nI\\'ve been in quite a low mood because of some job related bullshit. Usually when I get depressed at home I start doing the dishes, dusting the rooms, and what not, not even because I like keeping things clean but removing my so to say \"traces\" are a small subconscious obsession of mine. \\n\\nSee, since I\\'m not under a huge load of work it suddenly occured to me that checking my email\\'s \"Accounts\" folder and terminating the ones I don\\'t use anymore would be a nice idea (both out of privacy-related paranoia and just for the heck of it). The thing is I used to have an Imgur account a lo-o-o-ong time ago (plz don\\'t bully), so I decided to delete it as well, but that didn\\'t seem quite possible to do the traditional way, since I didn\\'t get it by registering at the service directly. I\\'ll omit the details of all the cyber sex I went through with my keyboard and the browser, but I somehow got the long awaited notification confirming the fact that my account got discontinued, so I pretty much forgot about the whole deal. But little did I know.\\n\\nLater in the day I get back to browsing some picture subreddit and notice that some Imgur posts linked on the page suggest me to delete the image, although it wasn\\'t even submitted by me. In addition to that I still seem to be logged in, although no username shows up in the top-right dropdown user menu. Being the total jackass of an idiot that I am, after checking and confirming this with a few more links, I decide to google the #1 top Reddit post of all time, which, of fucking course, is a link to a post on Imgur (yeah, the one about the Senate, with a total of whole damn 310K updoots). I open it and see the tempting red button suggesting me to praise Satan himself. Of course Imgur won\\'t allow me to do that, those buttons probably don\\'t work, do they? It can\\'t be this bugged, right? (I hadn\\'t clicked one by then YET). So I click the button a-a-a-aand see the title of this TIFU.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry. I didn\\'t want to. Please, forgive me everyone.\\nI\\'ll commit Sudoku before the shame befalls on the name of my forefathers.\\nIf somebody working for Imgur sees it here, please, report it to who it would be most appropriate.\\n\\n**TL;DR: I deleted Reddit\\'s [#1 top post](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/62sjuh/the_senate_upvote_this_so_that_people_see_it_when/?sort=new) picture by playing around with Google sign-in on Imgur.**\\n\\nP.S.: resubmitted because it didn\\'t have TL;DR in the beginning\\n\\nEdit: link for clarification (try clicking the original \"Senate\" post\\'s title link).\\n\\nEdit 2.0: **I guess *I am the senate* now**\\n\\nEdit 2.6.5.32: I submitted the bug to Imgur\\'s contact form just in case...\\n\\nEdit 4.1.15: **just got from work to find a message from [u/_BindersFullOfWomen_](https://www.reddit.com/user/_BindersFullOfWomen_) on the behalf of Imgur\\'s team, so the bug seems to be closed by now, the picture\\'s back too** That\\'s pretty cool and fast of a reaction for such a huge service, especially for me since it\\'s already post working hours for me (I know, I know, time zones\\'n\\'shiiieeet).\\n\\nEdit over 9000: [to all the guys telling me about the difference between Seppuku and Sudoku](http://i.imgur.com/fs3Lkmj.png)\\n\\nEdit \"I lost the count\": [666 updewts](http://i.imgur.com/ilXdUsJ.png)\\n\\nEdit from the high ground: What the heck? Gold, 30K+ updanks, /r/all and numerous crossposts? **IRONIC**\\n\\nEdit from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away: **holy shit, now [the title of the Imgur post attached to the original Senate one](http://imgur.com/ChYwfMq) has my username engraved into it!** Obligatory; this happened a few months ago.  \\n  \\nI was relaxing in my living room while my parents were out. I had just pulled an all-nighter to finish my paper and I was watching TV and browsing random junk on my phone to relax when I had a small itch on my testicles (This is a warning that this post will be getting a little graphic)  \\nI went downtown to scrotum town to give the crown jewels a scratch and, in my unfocussed state, I missed slightly and scratched down the back of the tube-like thing that\\'s attached to your balls. (which I later learned is called the epididymis) This made me flinch slightly as the sensation on my jubblies was completely unexpected.  \\nI didn\\'t think about it though, scratched the itch in the correct place and carried on watching TV.  \\n  \\nWithin about half an hour though, my lack of sleep started to catch up on me (very suddenly) and I felt myself drifting off to sleep at about 2pm.  \\n  \\nI woke up at 2:45 to a numbing, sort of dull ache on my left penny in my coin purse. I thought nothing of it though and hoisted myself upright to drink water and then went back to sleep.  \\n  \\nI woke up a little later completely keeled over in the fetal position with my arms between my legs. I don\\'t remember waking up but I was in this incredible pain, like I\\'d snapped a muscle in my balls. I can\\'t really describe it but my left testicle felt \"different\" almost. Like it had gotten lumpy, bigger and soft. As I tried to right myself, sit up and adjust my pants, the pain struck all the way up my body and I vomited onto the carpet.  \\nAt this point I decided I needed to go to hospital so went on my phone and ordered an Uber there.  \\n  \\nIn what ended up being the most excruciating pain I\\'ve ever felt, I lay on the floor next to my vomit and waited an agonising 10 minutes for the Uber to arrive. Once it had, I bit my tongue and dragged myself (as upright as possible) to the front door and into the back of the Uber. The Uber driver didn\\'t really give a shit as I groaned and clenched in the back of the car and sort of dumped me outside the hospital. The next thing I remember was standing in line for the emergency room before trying to sit down. (I found out later that I had actually collapsed)  \\n  \\nI woke up the next morning with one less testicle, a very scared mother and a lesson in something called \"testicular torsion\".  \\nGentlemen (and people with testicles) of Reddit.  \\n  \\nPLEASE DON\\'T IGNORE YOUR DULL BALL-ACHES  \\n  \\nTL:DR - Ignored a panged ball. Ended up sans ball. this is a case of me being a chronic dumbass.\\n\\nI thought that because it was Halloween today that other people in a normally holiday loving school would wear at least a prop or one of those bouncy antenna headbands with pumpkins or ghosts but NOPE!\\n\\nNOT A SOUL.\\n\\nNobody wore or did ANYTHING to celebrate. I know it is a holiday that you eventually grow out of but since costumes are my passion I spent months on a bright orange pirate coat and made a costume to go underneath. I\\'m not usually the extrovert and due to a few recent unfortunate events and my shitty mental state I\\'m only at school like 50% of the time, and I thought \"maybe this time I can have a bit of fun just this once\" but fate had other plans for me on this rainy Halloween.\\n\\nits safe to say I was embarrassed and felt bad and surrounded and like a freak.\\n\\nif I see someone else with a costume on I might feel better but this was overkill, I\\'m in 11th grade and thankfully because of that I likely wont be made fun of but costuming will ALWAYS be my passion and someday I will feel okay being the only one in a crowd of people.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: since so many people wanted to see it, here is the link! [https://imgur.com/a/y9kUsVW](https://imgur.com/a/y9kUsVW)\\n\\nEdit 2: thank you all so much for telling your stories and comments, reading them I was honestly about to cry. I felt so alone today and you made me feel like I could do anything. thank you for all the love and support and there are no words to describe how much I love everyone that said something. this means so much.\\n\\nTL;DR wore bright orange pirate coat I spent months on and looked like a freak in front of an entire school Obligatory \"this concluded today\" - I\\'ve been working for Uncle Sam for about 7 years now. I\\'m severely desensitized to government fuckups and one day I received a letter from DFAS (the guys who actually pay us) that I was overpaid two whole cents.\\n\\nSilly I thought, between the postage (which for the government is free, but for someone it costs something) which I could probably estimate to be around 75 cents, The man-hours of sorting, sending and tracking that damn letter, and the gas money used to ship the thing to my front door - It was probably a 5 dollar letter.. to collect 2 cents.\\n\\nLaughing it off I taped it to my fridge as a reminder of whom I work for and why I should always pay my taxes as they are put to good use (looking at you F-35), and forgot about it. A month later, two weeks ago I get another nastygram in the mail but at the job. \"we contacted you at address XXXXX, if this is not your place of residence please update it and give us our 2 pennies.\"\\n\\nNow I\\'m kinda miffed and beyond amused that not only do they pay me before I ever see my money, meaning that fuckups are entirely on them - but now I\\'m being hounded for their fuckup and collectively we are all down about 10 bucks of taxpayer money. Being the Class A humorous guy that I am, I send an envelope with three pennies in it, and a poorly written sticky note saying \"heer yore 2 cent, I kunted et al myself. I lobe me job.\" Covered the entirety of the envelope in stamps, harry potter style, and threw that fucker in the unit mailbox.\\n\\nThis was a bad play because apparently Feds have no sense of humor.\\n\\nTwo weeks later, one week ago I got called into my officer\\'s office. Not a place an enlisted man ever wants to be, I was sketched out but \"it does what its told\".\\n\\nI\\'m standing there on the rug when he pulls out from his desk an envelope from our paycheck people. \"[me], mind explaining to me why I received a letter containing a single penny with a note explaining how you overpaid 19 dollars postage on a letter, over a two cent payment?\"\\n\\n\"uhh.. well sir, They spent like 15 dollars now sending me mail, so I thought I\\'d compensate them with a cent extra and some stamps to help out. Patriotism, y\\'know sir?\"\\n\\n\"Well, if you feel that patriotic, you can patriotically volunteer your free time too - We need these floors clean for [reason] and were looking for a class A go-getter to clean them.\\n\\nApparently captains have no sense of humor either.\\n\\nUntil tonight, I\\'ve been spending my free time mopping a lot of floor space.\\n\\nThank you Army. I will never forget you.\\n\\nTlDr; Army overpaid me 2 cents, I paid them back three and had to mop floors for their fuckup because feds have sticks up their asses by birth. This is the most horrifyingly disgusting thing that has ever happened to me. Fair warning. \\n\\nLast week, I adopted my first dog. His name is Franklin Beans and he is the absolute shit. Apparently his last owner was the human equivalent of a wet sandwich without any condiments on it. My dude was not in great shape when the fosters got him a few weeks ago. Since coming home, Franky B has been a real treat though. He has, unfortunately, had some nervous shit. I took this as further proof that Franklin and I were meant to be. My butthole is also afraid of working in new places. \\n\\nYesterday morning, I woke up in bed with my partner and Beans. My alarm goes off around six and I wake up to start another glorious day of teaching first graders online (yes, I have recently developed a drinking problem). As I\\'m fixing my tea in the kitchen, I hear a tiny dog fart. Franklin Beans is taking a shit in my living room. Oh rats! This seems like a slide backwards in the progress we made this week. Whatever. I go grab a baggie to remove the dookie from my beautiful original hard wood floors and see that there are WORMS on it. Little flat white 1/4 inch MOVING GODDAMN WORMS. I freak the fuck out, quietly because my partner is still sleeping. As I\\'m cleaning this up, I remember a reddit post about a cat with worms and rush to my bed to find just what I suspected: HUNDREDS OF TINY LITTLE DEAD DRIED UP WORMS. I unsuccessfully do my best to coax my partner to the couch without scaring him. I take Franklin outside to let him get the evil out of him. He immediately starts shitting again. But wait, that doesn\\'t even look like poop... it looks like...MORE AND BIGGER WORMS. DEAR GOD. Poor Frankin is now dragging his tiny little snake hole across the cement, desperately trying to get these fuckers to unlatch. It was breaking my heart so I tried to use the plastic bag I carry for his booty presents to pull the stowaway from his tunnel. Guys, this worm was at least six inches long. It was HORRIFYING. On our walk around the block, this happens about ten more times. By the time we reach my apartment, I\\'m honestly impressed that I haven\\'t fainted or screamed or thrown the whole dog out into a neighbor\\'s bin. \\n\\nI get back to my apartment and the poor little dude is still scooting all over those beautiful wood floors I mentioned previously. I call up the vet and start describing the nightmare that I am living, because at this point I\\'m pretty sure my dog is just a big cute bag of worms. While pacing around, I step in something wattery. I look reluctantly look down to see what appears to be a writhing fistfull of ramen noodles in a puddle of strawberry jam. I lose my ABSOLUTE SHIT and let out a blood curdling scream. This only frightens poor little Beans into releasing more worms from his bowels. I cancel my first live lesson and rush this spaghetti maker over to the vet for a drop off appointment, so I can get home and teach those tiny little psychopaths about verbs and shit. Around lunch time they call me to diagnose him as having a literal butt-ton of tapeworms. We talk care and recovery and I, still, am feeling slightly proud of myself for being as calm as I am. I hang up the call and return to my students, who are finishing up with lunch. As I log into the Teams Meeting, I see one of my students eating the worst possible food for this day: A fucking Cup O Noodles. I can no longer handle this situation. In a shameful display of squeamishness, I proceed to vom all over my couch. On camera. In front of students and parents. Children are shrieking. I\\'m shrieking. I have no idea how I\\'m going to explain this on Monday. \\n\\nTL;DR Unknowingly got myself a pup o\\' noodles and lost my lunch over a cup o\\' noodles. Happened years ago, but I was told to post this here.\\n\\nMy girlfriend (at the time) and I were dating for just shy of 6 years. We were high school sweethearts and still in school. She had always struggled with jobs and keeping them, and since we lived together, I usually had to pick up the slack. \\n\\nI was working as an assistant manager at a video game retail store at the time, probably not hard to figure out which one. It was honestly and easy job as long as you gave little effort, pre orders here, couple warranty sells there. As my girlfriend loved video games more than I did, I had the BRILLIANT idea to get her a job. She\\'s an attractive girl while 80% of our customers were neckbeards who hardly get to interact with women. Should be easy for her to make sales.\\n\\n\"There\\'s no way she can fuck this up\" I said, confidently to myself. There is a policy as of most companies that people in relationships can\\'t work at the same location. No problem. We have 12 stores in our district that are within a 5 mile radius. \\n\\nThey seriously put these stores on every other block.\\n\\nI do a little digging and hook her up at a neighboring store that had a vacant position. She would also be working with the head store manager of the district (indirectly one of my bosses). Few weeks in, and its going GREAT, what took me about a year to get moved up she does in weeks. I\\'m not a self conscious person, so I didnt care. Plus she could help pick up her half of the bills. \\n\\nHere\\'s where I started to realize I FU. Girlfriend comes driving in with a BRAND NEW CAR. Considering we were living paycheck to paycheck, I was pretty upset. I asked her where she got the car from and she told me \"I\\'ve been saving up\". Bullshit but okay. I loved her, so as long as shes happy, I\\'m happy. \\n\\nNext comes in with write ups. I started getting write ups and customer complaints left and right. I\\'m a very good employee and I very rarely make anyone upset. I couldn\\'t even find where these customers were coming from. Even though my performance was the best out of most employees, I was starting to fear for my job.\\n\\nAs to be predicted, I ended up getting fired. I tried to fight it but I live in Texas, and the rules are that companies can fire anyone at anytime for any reason. I\\'m absolutely crushed. I turn to my girlfriend for emotional support to find her extremely distant. \\n\\nShe dumped me days later, double whammy. I loved her for 6 years. She told me she felt this way for a while, things are the same. I\\'m absolutely heartbroken, I\\'m angry, depressed, jobless. Felt like my life got flipped upside down. One week later her Facebook status put her in a relationship WITH HER BOSS. MY BOSS. \\n\\nNot sure when it happened, but he bought her a car, and then got me fired. Turns out all the customer complaints about me originated from that store somehow. Total BS. I set her up to absolutely f*ck me over and to bone my boss.\\n\\nTl;dr: I got my girlfriend a job only for her to f*ck my boss and to get me fired \\n\\nI\\'m still a little sad about it, but it is what it issss.\\n\\nEdit: perhaps the biggest FU is the fact I didn\\'t sue. I was such an emotional wreck from everything it didnt even cross my mind. But I\\'m doing pretty well for myself now, and whatever money I\\'d get wouldn\\'t be worth bringing her to court for. Just the thought of seeing her sends chills down my spine.\\n\\nUPDATE: A couple of you guys were wondering, but they dated a few months and broke it off. Neither of them work for the company anymore. A little detail I forgot to mentioned that when she came to take her stuff from our place, he was helping carry the stuff to her car. That was probably the most gut wrenching moment for me. Both of them are POS.\\n\\n2nd Update: I really appreciate all the positive feedback, I\\'ve been mostly over it but the love really helps. Some of you guys are asking where she is now, she\\'s doing alright, shes engaged to one of my old high school friends (also slightly suspicious). Still driving that same car, too, from the looks of it. I\\'m doing pretty well for myself, and if theres any happy ending to this, is that I\\'m genuinely happier than I\\'ve ever been in my life.\\n\\n3rd AND PROBABLE FINAL UPDATE: Again, I really appreciate the positive messages. Reliving and retelling the story made me angry and I missed a few details.\\n\\n-I can\\'t prove that he bought her a car, but I was pretty aware of her finances, and she couldn\\'t afford a new car without significant help. It wasn\\'t a fancy car, it was a new Prius that was worth about $18,000, in addition to trading in her old car. And the rumor around the block was that he did in fact help her. \\n\\n-i was not a perfect boyfriend, I got upset at silly things, I could have been more attentive, but I never raised my voice, and I was very loyal. \\n\\n-the course of when she got promoted to when she got the car was roughly 3 or 4 months, the separation and firing happened about 2 months after that. I didn\\'t clarify that detail. \\n\\n-\"the boss\" was a DM in training, recently got promoted, and the kind of guy that would spend money to impress a girl. This happened over the summer. After work one day I went to a hotel bar. The bartender was super cute and the bar was practically empty so we chatted for over an hour. As I was getting ready to leave a bunch of people sat down at the bar and she got busy, I didn\\'t want to ask for her number in front of a bunch of people who were trying to order, or wait around, so I wrote my number on the check and left. I was half way home when I got a text from her. I excitedly opened my phone to \"hey it\\'s Sara the bartender at (hotel name), you didn\\'t pay your bill\" and my heart sank into my stomach. I texted her my card number and apologized. She never texted me back.\\n\\nTL;DR - Tried to leave my phone number on a check. I left, and got a text from her saying I didn\\'t pay.\\n\\n***EDIT: Ok guys I went through my phone history and found the texts. Yes it\\'s embarrassing. https://imgur.com/a/531ds7h\\n\\n***UPDATE: The last text she sent was the end of the conversation. It\\'s been over 7 months since this happened and I never texted her back after that. I did send her a link to this post though... and she replied!\\n\\n**** She commented on this post! Sort by new to find it. Her Reddit username is Ginascolaro96 she made an account just to respond \\n\\n****** She\\'s agreed to hang out! We\\'re going out for a drink soon! TIFU because I ran my mouth. This was not today, but last week. I had completely forgot it happened until I went out doing groceries with the wife and she reminded me to know my place.\\n\\nLast Sunday I went to do groceries. I always do them at 9 am on Sunday, nice and quiet here. I buzzed around the store, got everything I needed and proceeded to the check out. All was well. 20 minutes, in and out. \\n\\nAs I walk to the line up to wait for the cashier\\'s to call me forward, I stop behind a rather large lady. As I wait my turn to be called forward, a man comes out from behind a shelf with a couple items and steps in front of me. Just as I was about to say the line is behind me, he says \"I am with her.\" And puts the last of his shopping in the cart they have. \\n\\nWithout even thinking, not even attempting to process where I am, or who is around, the words just come out of my mouth.\\n\\n\"Sorry about your luck!\" \\n\\nYes. They came out with the happiest of tones. Like I was joking with the boys. But nope. I said it to a stranger in the line up. \\n\\nAs it dawns on me what I just said, I tense up, preparing to get hit, like I oh so deserve. But no, he starts to howl. He\\'s in tears over my comment. However, the lady was not. She reams me out, up one side, down the other. \"How dare you, you know nothing about me. Just because I\\'m over weight doesn\\'t mean I\\'m a bad wife!\" So on and so forth. I just stood there, dumbfounded, not sure what to do. \\n\\nShe then looks at her still laughing husband and says \"and what are you laughing over?! We just finished with the marriage counseling and you find this funny?\"\\n\\nShe walks out of the store in a huff, the man still laughing and everyone around starting at me. He gets called up and then I do and I proceed to pay and get out of there. He made it out before me and she was in the parking lot yelling about how they will be getting a divorce and how she can\\'t be with someone that finds things like that funny. \\n\\nI\\'m pretty sure I ruined what was left of the relationship. \\n\\nTL;DR: Went grocery shopping, told a stranger that I was sorry he had shitty luck for marrying a large woman. Pretty sure I caused a divorce. Went to fancy movie theater with date. Decide to buy a bottle of wine. Go back to bar. Ask for two glasses. Bartender says he needs two ID\\'s. I\\'m too lazy to go back to seats to grab dates ID. Tell him I\\'m alone and was embarrassed to ask for just one glass. He is clearly sympathetic. Idiot me then tries to sell the story and continue on about how lonely I\\'ve been recently. He tells me he\\'s off in a few minutes and insists on watching the movie with me. I try to fight it but I could only argue so much without giving away the truth. Bartender is insistent. I text my date what\\'s happening. Go back to theater with my new date. Sit a few rows in front of my first date. She has the stupidest grin on her face as me and the bartender (Jared) sit a couple rows in front of her. He ends up being super cool and bought me and him another bottle during the movie. Movie ends. I thank him for his gesture. He didn\\'t even ask for my number or anything. I think Jared was just a genuine guy trying to comfort someone. Met back up with my date in the parking lot and thankfully she found the whole thing hilarious.\\n\\nI don\\'t deserve Jared. So a little back story, my family moved to a whole new country were we didn\\'t speak the language when I was 12 years old and they put me in a normal school and told me to just deal with it. I struggled like hell because I didn\\'t speak a single word of English. The school they put me in was also rated one of the worst schools in the country, not just because of academic performance but also due to crime statistics (two separate stabbings happened on school premises while I was there). Anyway, I tried my hardest to ingratiate myself in the culture, the people and the language. One guy just completely hated my guts from day one. No idea why or what I did to him but he just absolutely hated me and showed it. he was your typical delinquent, stealing, ruining people\\'s property, skipping school, drugs fighting, gang related activities you name it he\\'s probably been involved in it. So that\\'s he kind of person I\\'m talking about, he would beat me up with his friends in tow, constantly taking the piss out of my accent and my English in class, in front of the teachers and all. There was a couple of occasions where they pushed me into a puddle of mud just before school started, or would follow me into the toilet while I was pissing and try to choke me out from behind. I naturally had to find ways to survive by knowing which toilets to use and when. When to leave school and which exist to use. Where to sit in class etc. Once this failed and him and his friends found me outside of school and beat the brakes off of me. Literally couldn\\'t do anything there was like 20+ boys and some men who came after to school to meet him. I just curled up and tried my best to protect my head.  The only thing that kept me sane that entire time was the knowledge that none of this would matter when we grow up. I would have a family, a job be an upstanding member of society and he would be in prison or at the very least not doing well. Karma has to work right? The world can\\'t be that unfair. \\n\\nFast forward 15 years. I haven\\'t kept in contact with anyone from that school. I didn\\'t make any friends and I didn\\'t develop Stockholm\\'s. I looked him up on Facebook. \\n\\nHe owns a very successful business he has a beautiful wife and two young kids. He lives in the best part of town, he owns a huge house and a few very expensive cars. He is doing incredibly well as opposed to me, not married, no kids, no job and back living with my parents. This has completely fucked me up for the past 5 days and I just can\\'t get over the bullshit I was fed, karma will get him for you. I think karma missed. \\n\\nTLDR: looked up my school bully and he is doing way better than I ever will. I know it sounds bad. It is bad. \\n\\nThis happened about three months ago. For context I live with my girlfriend in an apartment with one bedroom. \\n\\nMy sister was visiting from out of town. She said she\\'d sleep in the couch. I thought that would be that. We ate dinner, chatted, had a good time. When  it was time to go to bed, however, i was feeling horny. I turned off the hall light and then opened the door to crawl onto out Queen size bed. I don\\'t see shit. So I crawl in on my side, wait a few minutes, and then it happens. \\n\\nI turn to my girlfriend. Her back is facing me. I grab her ass and whisper \"I\\'d love to fuck you.\" those exact words. \\n\\nTurns out my girlfriend is a good hostess. She had offered to sleep on my couch instead of my sister. I ended up grabbing my sister\\'s ass and telling her id love to fuck her. \\n\\nMy sister turned to me. \"Max?\" I recognized her voice. \\n\\nI hoped out of bed. I was mortified. I ran into the living room and, sure enough, there was my girlfriend. I ran back into the bedroom and apologized to my sister. We both got a good laugh out of it, at least, even if I was laughing through the tears. \\n\\nTL;DR My girlfriend and sister switched rooms without telling me. I ended up grabbing my sister\\'s ass and saying I\\'d love to fuck her.\\n\\nEdit: I am now single. 23 male. Bisexual. Please fullfill the empty hole left in my life.\\n\\nEdit two: So the reason she broke up with me is two reasons: She\\'s a controlling ass and she thought I had exposed her privacy because my full first name is in the username. Such bullshit. So I’m a curious gal. I was bored at my grandparent’s house. My grandpa is a smoker who unsuccessfully tried to quit, so he has a bunch of unused nicotine patches lying around.\\n\\nNow my grandpa is a big guy with decades of smoking history. I’m an underweight young woman who has never touched a cigarette in her life.\\n\\nI thought “its just a patch.” So in my infinite stupidity, I slapped it on my arm.\\n\\nMistake. Within 20 minutes I felt like I was dying. I was lightheaded, my pulse was crazy fast, and I felt more nauseous than I ever felt in my life. I proceeded to vomit my entire breakfast and lunch. I was sitting on the toilet, pooping, and barfing into a bag at the same time.\\n\\nI feel better now and thank God I ripped off that patch. I am never, ever touching a cigarette or alcohol or any other drugs ever again. I’m also going to be eating nutritious foods everyday and start to really take care of my body. Jesus take the wheel.\\n\\nTL;DR: Never fucking smoke or do drugs or drink, holy shit, being healthy and feeling good is so important. So I have always had extremely long hair. Just yesterday it reached the floor when it was down. It was thick and healthy and well cared for. Recently my mother was diagnosed with cancer and it’s been a horrible time for all of us. She recently started her chemo treatments and no one is sure what’ll happen, but we all hope she’ll be okay. She began losing all her hair from the treatments, it wasn’t nearly as long as mine, but she still loved it and had really healthy hair. So I started talking with my boyfriend about donating it and we agreed I should. So yesterday I shaved my head completely bald even with a razor and everything. I had it all nicely separated and donateable and I went to a pretty highly regarded charity (I did ask if they could make one for my mother and they agreed). Afterwards I went about my day. Then I went back home and me and soon after my boyfriend came home, he was shocked to find that I was bald and thought when I was donating it I’d only cut off a little bit. I thought this was weird since I mentioned buzzing everything off since my mother was bald as well. He said he never thought I’d do it. But we changed the subject quickly and ate dinner before going to bed. This morning I woke up when he was getting up for work and he told me he couldn’t be with a bald girl. I kindly reminded him it would grow back to which he replied that it would take too long. So he broke up with me and left my apartment. Leaving me alone, hairless, and scared. \\n\\nTL;DR: I donated all of my super long hair and my boyfriend broke up with me because he didn’t want to be with a bald girl\\n\\nEdit: I’m feeling a lot better now. The only thing I’m sorry about now is that people keep giving awards to a throwaway account that I entered random letters into as the password\\n\\nEdit 2: Guys this is a throwaway, stop giving me all these awards lol. I do really appreciate all the kind messages though lol *****UPDATE: YA GIRL MIGHT GET ANOTHER CHANCE\\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/NAxCp8y\\n\\n*Edited to say: yes, he explained that he was “micro”, that’s how I learned the term. Not a grow-er. 2, of course I’m not going to tell anyone and 3, no he hasn’t texted me back yet. \\n**edit #2: the movie was Parasite \\n\\n\\nThrowaway, because obvious. \\nThis happened last night and I feel so bad and embarrassed. Before now I had no idea micropenis was a thing. Some people are big, some people are small. That was the extent of my penile knowledge. I’ve only had sex with 2 people, so I’m not very experienced, anyway. \\n\\nThis guy and I have mutual friends and have been flirting for months, and he’s *so hot* with a great personality. Last night after a few of our friends canceled I asked him if he wanted to come over and watch a movie.\\n\\nHe comes over, I make dinner and we have a great time. We have a couple glasses of wine and I’m not quite tipsy, but loose enough that I don’t think about what I’m saying. We move over to the living room to start a movie, and he starts making a move. I’m thinking oh yeah, here we go. Finally. It’s getting hot and heavy and I start making my way downtown because blowjobs are my favorite thing. I pull down his pants and for a minute I’m shocked. He has absolutely no length at all, basically just a head. I think something happened to him and say “oh my god, what happened?!” And he kinda freezes and says nothing happened. I’m confused and he starts awkwardly kind of explaining that everything works, obviously, that’s just his size. At this point it’s awkward enough that it kinda kills the mood and he says “I mean, we don’t have to do anything” and I starts babbling that no no, it’s fine, everything is okay! I can tell he feels weird at this point and kind of sits up on the couch, and I’m thinking I’ve ruined this and he doesn’t want to hook up anymore. I say “are you still turned on? Do you want to?” And he kind of gives me a blank look which prompts my dumb ass to say “I’m sorry it’s just that I can’t tell”\\n\\nWhat I *meant* was that I can’t tell if he still wants to have sex by his body language, *not* that I can’t tell if he’s turned on because of his lack of noticeable erection. This completely extinguished whatever we had going and he pulls his pants up while I’m trying to explain. He won’t let me talk and keeps repeating that no, no, it’s fine, we should watch the movie. Not knowing what to do I sit back on the couch and we awkwardly watch the tv in mortified silence. Eventually when it’s over (I’m surprised he stayed) he basically rushes out the door. \\n\\nI texted him this morning asking if he wants to hang out again and apologized for making things weird. He hasn’t texted me back and he’s been on Instagram so I know he’s seen it. I feel so bad! And it doesn’t really matter that his penis is small, I’d still go out with him anyway! It’s not enough to deter me. But I totally ruined it and now he hates me\\n\\nTL;DR insulted my hookups penis and made him feel weird and now I not only ruined sex but ruined any future chances It\\'s not really a fuck up, it\\'s more of a chaotic scenario i made for myself.\\n\\nSo back in 1988, my dad went with his friends to a vacation in Greece. By extreme luck, somehow, my dad found David Bowie, riding on a rented motorcycle. My dad, who\\'s a really big fan of him, went to him and asked him if is it cool to take a picture with him. David agreed and even let my dad to seat on the motorcycle behind him for the picture. My dad, overly excited, set down on the motorcycle *really* close to David, and one of my dad\\'s friends took the picture for him. \\nBack for today, i asked my dad if it\\'s cool if i\\'ll upload the photo for r/oldschoolcool because i knew that sort of pictures are welcomed in the sub. So instead of thinking an extra second, i wrote in the title \"my dad with David Bowie in a vacation in Greece. 1988\"\\n(I didn\\'t even noticed the typo \"in a vacation\")\\nBecause of my dumbass title and my dad sitting to close to Bowie, literally all of the comments are how my dad and Bowie had sex on that vacation and how my dad is actually gay. For now I posted the picture about 7 hourse ago, and it reached to r/all with 55k upvotes and 2.4k comments with with almost all of the comments are in the style of \"your\\'e adopted\" your dad and Bowie def banged bro\" etc. \\nAt the start it was really funny, i showed some of the comments to my dad and he laughed his ass off, but now with like 2.5k comments like that it\\'s just straight up chaos.\\nThe internet is a beutiful mess.\\n\\n \\nTL;DR: i posted a picture of my dad with David Bowie with a bad title and everyone thinks my dad is gay and he and Bowie fucked.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe original post:\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/OldSchoolCool/comments/eltj5q/my_dad_with_david_bowie_in_a_vacation_in_greece/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share Obligatory “It’s 7 AM. This didn’t happen today, but very recently.” I have been packing a lunch for work for about the past two months. I pack it usually, but if I’m behind schedule, my fiancée will sometimes help or do it for me.\\n\\nI got home from work, and we were talking about how the day went. She asked me how lunch was, and I told her it was good and thanked her again. After a pause, she kinda laughed and said “Did you like the note today?!”\\n\\nPuzzled, I told her I didn’t know what she was talking about. She said “The note. The one I put it your lunch today.” I told her I didn’t see a note. But the way she said “today” made it feel like this wasn’t the first time. I said “Wait. Have you written me a note before?”\\n\\nShe said “Yes. Have you never seen them?” So apparently this is the 9th note she has written on a napkin, and I’ve thrown every one in the trashcan at work.\\n\\nTLDR: my fiancée was being sweet as per usual, and I was literally throwing it in the garbage can. For context I\\'m a grown ass man, I was helping my cousin out over the weekend to sand and oil his newly built deck when we got talking about me not being able to find a damn ps5 in stock. I told him I was pissed that scalpers were buying them up and flipping them for twice their msrp and just bitching like a bitch in general, when he tells me his nephew just got a ps5 for free, I was like what? Little ray ray? That little fucker got a ps5 for free? He doesn\\'t even play his ps4 pro you guys got him for his birthday 3 months ago! that little dude is a mobile gamer. I ask my cousin how the hell he got a ps5 for free, my cousin was like \"cancer\"......FUUUCCCKKK......I totally forgot that kid had cancer, my cousin was like yeah dude make a wish hit him up and asked him if he wanted a ps5, he said sure. Now before the devil comes and takes me to hell, the kid is in remission, he\\'s a little fighter from what I know and is overall a good kid. I don\\'t hang out with little ray ray much but damn did I feel like a giant asshole after I got home.\\n\\nTL;DR called my cousins cancer stricken nephew a fucker for getting a ps5 for free from make a wish foundation\\n\\nEdit: woke up to this on the front page of TIFU, lots of different opinions on the matter, I obviously changed little ray rays name just in case some of his family is on reddit and comes across this post. Don\\'t get me wrong, the kid is a cool kid but he isn\\'t exactly family to me as he is my cousin\\'s wife\\'s sister\\'s son. Just glad some of you all found the humor in this as I definitely laughed at my self for being such a dumbass about forgetting the cancer thing.\\n\\n2nd edit: so I guess this dude thought my story was good enough to rip off as his own.\\n\\nhttps://vm.tiktok.com/ZMJxG2Tgx/ I’m an adult now but an Ask Reddit thread brought up a memory from 5 years ago so I thought I would share. \\n\\nTo paint a picture, my parents were not sex positive, or negative. Was never given the talk but was never told to abstain. I went to college my freshman year, and now that I had a mailbox that wasn’t my parents, I bought a vibrator. I broke my back freshman year (100% recovery, minor surgery) and so I subsequently took a gap year back at home to recover. Enter vibrator. I was 19, still a horny teenager, and banned from sexual intercourse for 6 months because of my back. I did the deed frequently to say the least. Door closed, locked, whatever. \\n\\nOne day I’m home alone, and I decide to get down to business. I turn the vibrator on when I realize I left my phone in the other room, so I run out to grab it. I leave my room without turning off the vibrator and ITS SO LOUD. The room I’m going to is at the end of the hallway, PAST my parents room. Meaning, if I can hear this buzzing from this room, my parents can 100% hear it. I do a quick canvas of the house and realize there is not a single spot where you can’t hear the vibrator. I had flashbacks to the countless times my parents were in their room at night probably listening to a faint buzzing and laughing at me. \\n\\nI’ve never thrown out something so quickly in my life. My parents never addressed it, but they know.\\n\\nTL;DR my vibrator is a sonic jet that can be heard from the entire house It’s as stupid as it sounds.\\n\\nYesterday my girl had her weekly friends evening with her BFFs. They usually come over to our flat and they drink, talk and watch movies.\\n\\nAround that time I’m usually at the gym so to not disturb them. But yesterday a friend of mine wanted to come along so I went there an hour earlier.\\n\\nSometimes after I come home from training we have spontaneous sex, as she likes me being sweaty from the gym.\\nSo I come home early and hear the TV running and I assumed, that she didn’t hear me.\\nThat’s when the dick-driven idiot part of my brain forgot about the fact, that she had girls evening and suggested to get rid of all clothes and jump her on the couch.\\n\\nI busted through the door and...have more eyes on me than planned.\\nHer best friends stare at me in complete disbelief, nobody saying a word. Some get red and look away, some stare at me like they’ve never seen a man’s privates before and my girlfriend started to gasp, followed with more gasping and stumps of words and ending with a well deserved WTF. \\n\\nThe silence after that was fucking killing me, but my girlfriend came to the rescue. I uttered a loud FUCK and she instantly replied with: „Good plan, bad execution.“ Her friends all laughed and even I had to smile at that before fleeing the scene to get some clothes.\\n\\nI even joined them after that, although still embarrassed. Of course my dick was the talk of the town, but they at least all took it with humor.\\n\\nTl;dr: Busted naked into my SO’s girl evening.\\n\\n**Edit:** Holy shit, rip my inbox. Thanks to everyone for their funny comments, upvotes and to the anonymous benefactors for their gold/silver.\\n\\nAnd now to answer the most asked questions:\\n\\nYes, I asserted dominance by slapping everyone with my dick and yelling „Piñata! Piñata!“\\n\\nOf course I ran home naked to surprise my girlfriend.\\n\\nYes, I plan to marry my SO. Plan includes me naked-manning her girls evening again with her ring around my cock and a bow tie. \\n\\nYes, I will post an update when the time comes. Don’t know how long that will take though.\\n\\nYes, the update will include a live stream.\\n\\nAnd the most asked question: yes, I’m well equipped and stormed the castle with a raging boner and in helicopter motion. Dick stopped at 2 o’clock, when I realized the fuck up. Obligatory this didn’t happen today, but almost ten years ago.\\n\\n\\nMy GF (now wife) and I were spending time with her family at her grandma’s house. Her grandma had a Nintendo Wii at the time, and my GF’s brother would have been five years old. As you can expect, he always wanted to play the Wii and any mention of it would guarantee his excitement and begging for inclusion.\\n\\n\\nIt was nearly the little guy’s bedtime and I whispered to my GF, “You want to play the Wii when your brother goes to bed?” She said, “Yes” and we were excited for him to go to bed. Since the Wii was located in the family living room, I decided I would sneakily let the family know we were reserving the TV for an epic match of Wii Tennis.\\n\\n\\nI approached my GF’s mom, uncle, and grandma and said, “If you guys don’t mind.... we’d like to use the living room once the little guy goes to bed.”\\n\\n\\n*silence*\\n\\n\\nMe: “You know..... for....”\\n\\n\\n(me thinking)\\n\\n\\n“Three letter word....”\\n\\n\\nHer family made faces I will never forget as they thought of a different three letter word that I wanted to partake in with their beloved daughter/granddaughter/niece in the living room.\\n\\n\\nI realized my mistake after a good ten seconds of funny faces being throw my way, and I fumbled over my explanation of “oh dear god I meant we want to play the Wii!”\\n\\n\\nTLDR: Wanted to play the Wii with my GF, and told her family we wanted to do a “three letter word” in the living room which made them think of sex.\\n\\n\\n**Edit: Since enough people have asked, we actually wanted to play Wii. This was not a cover up for sex.** Tonight I caught my wife telling my kid a bedtime story involving a wombat. I paused when I heard her say, “And then the wombat waved goodbye and off he went. Wiishoo! Wiishooo!!” I asked her later what those sounds represent and she told me his wings. When I explained that wombats don’t have wings and are essentially huge marsupials, I broke her childhood.  Her dad, a wonderful man who passed last year, used to tell her and her sister this same bedtime story. She immediately called her 40-year-old sister and asked her if she knew wombats didn’t have wings (“no!”), then her widowed mom (“no!”). All three were used to her dad’s wholesome story about the talking womBAT and apparently never came across a photo of the Australian animal in 37 years.\\n\\nTL;DR: I broke it to three adults that a wombat doesn’t have wings, so their treasured childhood bedtime stories proved to be “inaccurate.”\\n\\nEdit: Thanks for the wonderful thoughts, awards, and interest from many of you. I know people want the bedtime story, but it’s actually a series of stories; think fairytale meets Princess Bride. He intended to make some children’s books, but for now they’re still favorite bedtime stories. We may write them down soon, but it’s hard to translate the sound effects and voices to text. I just worry that some of you might not like the story, especially if you find out that the wombat is the villain(!)....and don’t worry, the kids still think wombats have wings! Bit of context; I was a fairly dumb, nine year old at the time this happened. I\\'m 26 now. \\n\\nWell it begins at a small-ish, outside, family gathering on my dad\\'s side, (my parents split up some few years earlier, and my mom had primary custody) and I had spaced myself from the other children and took up refuge beneath the adult table. It\\'s where I got to hear all the awful rumors and jibberjabber, so why not, right?\\n\\nWhile I sat amongst rubble and dirt, I had this amazing idea to put pebbles in the ridge of my ear now and again, and treat them individually like a car on a racetrack.\\n\\nAgain, I wasn\\'t bright. \\n\\nWell. I drove one of them bitches right into my ear canal.\\n\\nThat said, I flipped out at the idea that this object slid into my ear, and suddenly I can\\'t remove it. Not a single adult was even aware I was under the table by this point,  because of course all the brats were locked in the backyard.\\n\\nSo when this screech of terror left my mouth, all that was heard otherwise would\\'ve beeen knees against the table and dining-ware clattering.\\n\\nI lost my mind.\\n\\nMy dad yanked me up and immediately took me to the bathroom and started the hydrogen peroxide treatment to the ear, assuming it was just a panic attack, and that it was earwax agitating my ear drum or something. Probably not the most keen reaction, but the thought process was sound. Whatever really.\\n\\nEither way, after what seemed like hours, him, his mother, brothers, and sisters reassured me it was fine, saying it probably fell out and that I was overreacting.\\n\\nOkay. Sure.\\n\\nLet\\'s skip ahead a bit, it was roughly a two year span between 14 and 16, and I\\'m in highschool.\\n\\nThis is where the real fun begins. Equalbrium (Equilibrium) issues immerge, sprinkles of lost balance mostly. I could no longer submerge my head in water for more than a few seconds, high and low pressures made me sick. Plus general discomfort over little things like showering, sleeping, traveling. Was a nightmare, really.\\n\\nI get to thinking about things, and grab a simple paperclip then bend it straight, putting a little loop on the end before fishing around my ear for that \"imaginary rock\" I had long ago forgotten.\\n\\nAll I hear is scrapes.\\n\\nScrrch, skkkrt, shhhhh\\'sh.\\n\\nI\\'ll admit, I immediately started to panic before running off to my mom, who rightfully rushed me to hospital while demanding why she hadn\\'t been told up until now. That\\'s another topic entirely.\\n\\nWell wouldn\\'t you know, though? The doctor said I was faking, examined my ear, and said I just had compacted earwax and was likely trying to get out of school. Right. It was probably June at the time.\\n\\nMy mom didn\\'t really believe him, but I decided \"balls to it. Let\\'s get some Hydro-Perox!\", because fuck hospitals really.\\n\\nSkip along the years a bit more, I\\'m 18 and I know for a fact there is something In-My-Fucking-Head. I\\'m losing it. So I hit the hospital again, and this time the doctor outright states, \"There\\'s definitely blockage. I\\'m not sure if it\\'s a rock, but I can certainly try to help.\"\\n\\nSo this Professional, pulled out this gnarly looking pair of Scissor-Hemostats and gets to just.. having his absolute way with my ear canal, trying to get a grip on this smooth object. It was audio torture, hands down. Rubbing steel to granite, but centimeters from your eardrum and this went on for at least four minutes, until my ear began to bleed lightly.\\n\\nThe end results? \"You\\'ll need to see a specialist\", the specific type eludes me, but basically it was the same guy that removes peanuts from toddler\\'s nasal cavities.\\n\\nI\\'ll admit right now, my choices here forward were dumb as all hell.\\n\\nThe sight of my ear bleeding sent me off the deep end, and I began refusing all help entirely; only trying to remove it myself from that point on and truthfully just torturing myself when I reflect back.\\n\\nLet\\'s time jump one last time. I\\'m 22, couple months away from 23, I have a wonderful girlfriend, things are great, but headaches have developed and are a reoccurring thing, however my balance issues have been basically been worked out. Great.\\n\\nBut now, out of the blue, I\\'m losing Hand-Eye coordination. Well damn, you know? I attributed it to the rock in my fucking skull.\\n\\nI lost it yet again, and went on a rampage this time, demanding my girlfriend give me all her dental and dermal tools so that I could dig this chunk of earth out myself.\\n\\nThree different sized hooped, still sticks, a couple of mirrors, a flat ended rod and a hooked stick. But that last one was phased from the situation immediately.\\n\\nThis was the beginning in some sense, to my 20 minute conquest to become a pro- surgeon, and I locked myself away to be alone; working and prodding these weird little hooped rods around in my ear, mostly loosening wax and grinding against the round sides of the, admittedly small, stone.\\n\\nEventually the rod\\'s end slipped absurdly close to my ear drum, and wrapped around the rock. In an instant I froze but my heart began pounding through my chest.\\n\\nJackpot.\\n\\nNow, you see, this is a difficult feeling to explain in person, let alone through text.\\nThe pain from pulling this earwax lathered object from my ear canal was like.. a migraine shifting from my left ear to my right, while in the same sense it felt like I was passing a kidney stone from my skull.\\n\\nAll in all, 2/10. Wouldn\\'t do again.\\n\\nBut now it\\'s totally out and I have it put away in a ziplock bag.\\n\\nI had no real recovery issues I guess. As soon as the rock was out, my hearing was incredible in the one ear!.. for an entire day. Now it just rings occasionally.\\n\\nMy balance won\\'t ever be the same I feel, but it\\'s fine enough as is. Otherwise, underwater swimming is a no-go, I have minor sensitivity to changing atmospheric air-pressure still, and I get occasional headaches around the right side of my head.\\n\\nNot a bad trade out.\\n\\n[Size reference](https://i.imgur.com/xAxLEG9.png)\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n**_EDIT_**: For everyone calling me an idiot, trust me I know. For everyone concerned about my follow through, it was 3 years ago and I\\'ve been to the hospital between then and now for basic check-ups and have mentioned the stoned-ear before. It\\'s fine. This is why I can laugh it off.\\n\\n**_Another Edit_**: 9yrs old at the beginning, 22 at the removal. Had to check a few timestamps.\\n\\nI\\'m currently 26.\\n\\nAlso, spelling\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\nTLDR: I put a rock in my ear at 9yrs old, went to two doctors, one didn\\'t believe me, the other couldn\\'t help. Pulled it out myself after 13 years when I was 22 and now I can\\'t swim underwater, storm cells give me minor headaches, and I have poor balance. Last night I saw something no 16 year old, let alone any year old should ever see.\\n\\nMy dad works in construction and spends most of his time around very loud power tools. He just recently went to the doctor to check out his ears and he was told he was losing his hearing (even though everyone knew that because you have to shout to talk to him.)\\n\\nWell last night I woke up from a 4 hour mid-day nap at around 10 o\\'clock and I deliriously remembered I had to take my medication. My mom keeps my meds in her room so she can distribute them to me when I need them + my parents room is in a loft so I have to shout upstairs to let them know I\\'m coming. \\n\\nI go to their door and knock\\n\\n(no answer)\\n\\n\"Hello!\" I shout up the stairs\\n\\n(Nada)\\n\\nI proceed to walk up the stairs to see if they\\'re even home... they were. My dad had his face buried in my mothers crotch, he was eating her out.\\n\\n(Goosebumps)\\n\\n   I quickly shuffled down the stairs as quietly as I could, hyperventilating from the H.P. Lovecraft X Blumhouse Production I just witnessed. My mom didn\\'t hear me, she was covering her face with a pillow. My dad didn\\'t hear me, he is deaf.\\n\\n   That image has stained my memory and I spent the next hour lying in bed staring at the ceiling. I am truly sorry to any kid who has to witness their dad performing cunnilingus on their mother.\\n\\nTL;DR- Forgot dad was deaf and walked upstairs to my dad eating out my mom\\n\\nEdit: Grammaarr\\nEdit 2: more grammaarr I\\'m 7 months pregnant. I\\'m at the point where I\\'m large and uncomfortable and regular sex is getting awkward. I\\'m also dealing with a lot of pain in my back, hips, and legs. So, we decided to just play around. Kinda felt like my teenage years when i didn\\'t want to give it up, yet. He got me off a few times with mouth and fingers. It was amazing. \\n\\nI went down to return the favor. I was getting into it and doing my best work. Just as he was coming in my mouth, I suddenly thought, \"everything I swallow goes to my baby.\"  It grossed me out. I started gagging and had to run to the bathroom and threw up all my dinner. I couldn\\'t stop the reaction. He comes in and holds my hair and cleans up the splatter on the toilet while I\\'m brushing my teeth and using mouthwash. \\n\\nSo, now I\\'m worried that I\\'ve hurt my husband or made him feel like he\\'s unattractive or something. He\\'s not acting weird about it but I\\'m afraid he\\'s bothered and hiding it, even though he\\'s assuring me that he\\'s not. \\n\\nI feel like a shitty wife. Damn hormones and overthinking brain.\\n\\nTLDR hormones and overthinking caused me to throw up after giving my husband a blow job because I didn\\'t want my baby eating her siblings.\\n\\n\\nEdit: I did explain right away. He just said, \"Well, I guess we\\'re not doing that for a while.\" Also, I\\'ve taken biology classes. I know it\\'s an irrational thought. Pregnancy is full of those. As for brushing my teeth, we were headed right to bed and I didn\\'t want to sleep with puke breath so I weighed the pros and cons and figured it couldn\\'t hurt too much to brush right after once.\\n\\nAlso, he found this. And he said, \"You sold our sex life for a reddit silver.\" Lmao, guess I did. The repercussions happened today, the labeling of the titty juice was done yesterday.\\n\\nMy wife and I have a newborn and we\\'ve been calling her breast milk \\'titty juice\\' from the moment it came out.  We found it funny and as we\\'re finding out right now, having something to laugh about when you have a newborn around is very precious.\\n\\nWhile I was at the office today my mother in law, who is a very strict and traditional Asian lady came over to help my wife out and give her a bit of a rest.  That rest was very short lived.  The baby decided it was hungry so grandma reached into the fridge to grab a package of breast milk...\\n\\nWhen she read \"Freshly Squeezed Titty Juice 21/07/2019\" she lost her got damn mind.  She woke my wife up and aggressively expressed thoughts on how her one and only grand child is going to be corrupt from the get go.  Raised with no manners or respect.  She then left the house saying she doesn\\'t know if she can come back.\\n\\nMy wife in the other hand, besides being extremely tired has had some of the hormonal challenges that can come from giving birth and getting reamed out by her mom was a tipping point.  She passed on the reaming over the phone (not the norm for her) with pretty much the gusto as her mother.\\n\\nI didn\\'t get upset because I\\'m not the one who squeezed out a 7.5lb creature that does not keep a schedule, respect your time and is completely dependent on you for its very survival.\\n\\nTL;DR  I labeled the breast milk a crude and offensive name.  Now I have an even more tired, emotional and pissed wife to come home to who may have lost some extra support... and a mother in law who thinks I embody everything that\\'s wrong with western culture and parents these days. I’ve been dating this guy for a few months. He has a fetish for petite Asian girls, that I know. But he also has a thing for big breasts, which I attribute to his “hentai porn” fascination where women are depicted in strange and inhuman proportions. \\n\\nIn the past month, he has been making comments here and there about breast implants. He would send me articles on the joys of saline vs silicone implants, for example, and would tell me I’d be “perfect” if I got some saline implants to fill a DD cup, as a “joke” of course. (DD is not crazy actually because my band size is 30, which is equivalent to a 34C, but still insulting to me.)\\n\\nSo I finally had it a week ago and told him to stop making jokes about implants because they are not funny and insulting. I told him most petite Asian women are not big breasted contrary to his hentai fantasy. He did stop for a few days, then today again he mentioned to me how great I’d look in a double D while we were out having brunch. \\n\\nSo I snapped, and I said well maybe he should get some testicle implants to augment the size of his cherry testicles. Well he didn’t take my suggestion too kindly and went home in a huff by himself. He hasn’t returned any of my texts since. \\n\\nTL;DR: I underestimated how fragile my bf’s ego is concerning his balls and I insulted him deeply by suggesting he get implants.\\n\\nEdit/Update: looks like he is breaking up with me by ghosting. I tried calling him to apologize since he’s ignoring my texts and he is sending my calls directly to voicemail. :(\\n\\nMore Edit: I’m very sorry if I gave the wrong impression of him here. Words are very limited. He really is a good guy otherwise. I know and I hear everyone: he is really foolish in how he expresses his fetish. But I really like him (AND his balls big or small!). I did not mean to hurt him this deeply and I’m just so sad right now that I hurt him this much. I feel like a terrible person. I shouldn’t have reacted with cattiness that I didn’t even mean because I like his balls just the way they are!\\n\\nOne last edit tonight: he just texted back a short message saying he needs a little time before he can consider my apologies. Not sure where this will go but I guess I’ll see. Actually, it was my wife and a couple months ago during the boy scouts’ popcorn sales (or whatever they are selling this year.) We always buy popcorn or whatever the boy scouts are selling since my son was once a boy scout and was a great salesman and won lots of prizes for his sales. So the boy scouts in the neighborhood can always count on us buying a few boxes from whoever shows up at the door.\\n\\nWe have three dogs. Two of them go into a barking frenzy when anyone rings the doorbell. To combat this, we keep a water gun by the door since being squirt a couple of times shuts them right up. One day, the doorbell rings, the dogs go into their frenzy, and my wife notices that the squirt gun is not sitting by the front door but had been moved to the kitchen. So she yells “It’s boy scouts. Get the gun!” to my son in the other room. \\n\\nWhen she opened the door the two boys were about to bolt until they see the small purple water gun in her hand.\\n\\nTL;DR Boy scouts at our front door thought they were going to be met with deadly force.\\n\\nEdit: Thanks for all the generosity! [Dog tax.](https://i.imgur.com/tOHmu5r.jpg) They hate being squirt but get into water whenever they have a chance, even in the middle of the winter. Spike is the cairn terrier. He\\'s over 15 years old and has never barked at people or the doorbell. Pepper is the schnauzer, and a true watch dog since he\\'s a yapping machine. Annie was a starving stray we found living under a bridge about 7 years ago. She is likely part basenji since although she barks, especially when Pepper instigates her, she mostly whines loudly when she\\'s excited.\\n\\n[The deadly weapon.](https://i.imgur.com/nUiTeJa.jpg) Highly recommended squirt gun. It has lasted for years, goes to about 20 ft, and is accurate. I heard about it on reddit to keep cats off counters. I debated whether or not this belongs here cause it\\'s more or less just me being an awkwo-taco. But my coworker seems to think this counts as a fuck up so here we go. \\n\\nSidenote: This happened a few years ago and still makes me want to cringe into oblivion and facepalm myself to freaking mars.\\n\\nI work at customer service at a hardware store and one of things that we typically handle are returns. I had this older, tough looking guy come in who wanted to return a hose. He was a real nice guy compared to the majority of assholes I get who tend to speak down to me just because I\\'m a girl who works in a hardware store. Anyway, he wanted to return his hose and he didn\\'t have a receipt so I said I could give him store credit if he had his driver license on him. He agrees and he opens his wallet and I notice a picture of a little girl inside it who looks no older then 8. Trying to make conversation I decide to comment on it:\\n(OP: Me | OG: Old Guy)\\n\\nOP: Oh is that your granddaughter? She\\'s so cute!\\n\\nOG: Oh no... That\\'s my daughter.\\n\\n*FUCK, I basically just implied this guy was old.*\\n\\nOG: Oh cool! She\\'s really cute! What grade is she in?\\n\\n*Guy gets real quiet and looks really solemn all of a sudden*\\n\\nOG: She\\'s dead. She was hit by a car. A week after the picture was taken \\n\\nIn my mind I FUCKING PANICKED. I literally didn\\'t know what to say and my brain was malfunctioning. And this is what I came up with:\\n\\nOP: Oh, well... that sure is a daughter to be proud of! It\\'s too bad she died!\\n\\nThe guy literally says nothing and just starts fucking crying. In record time I get his return done and hand him his store credit with the typical, \"Have a nice day!\" And he leaves in tears, clutching his wallet to his chest.\\n\\nGuys. \\n\\nI told him \"you must be proud of your fucking dead daughter\".\\n\\nAnd that, \"oh geez, sucks that she\\'s dead!\" That\\'s what my fucking brain came up with. \\nFML.\\n\\nTL;DR - Subtly implied to a customer that he was old and told him that he must be proud of his dead daughter and that it sucks that she\\'s dead.\\n\\n**UPDATE: Holy shit.**\\n\\nI did not expect this to get that many upvotes or comments (also thank you for the gold and silver). Appreciate the comments that sympathize with my dumbass (as well as the ones that have left me in stitches).\\n\\nTo answer a few comments: \\n*Why didn\\'t you just say \\'I\\'m sorry\\' and move on?*\\n\\nBecause that would of been the smart thing to say and as I have referenced, I am a complete and utter dumbass. Also, I am incredibly socially awkward and this situation was literally my worst nightmare so I was trying to backpeddle as fast as I could and in my panicked state this is what came out of my mouth.\\n\\n*Why would you comment on the kids picture? That\\'s weird.*\\n\\nYeah your right, it was kind of a weird thing to say looking back on it. But like I said I am very socially awkward and was honestly just trying to be friendly. This happened when I was still pretty new to the job and I had never worked in retail before so I wasn\\'t really knowledgeable on what you should and shouldn\\'t talk about with customers. After this happened I learned my lesson and I have only ever asked how a person\\'s day is going or have made comments about the weather. \\n\\n*Why do you work in customer service? You clearly don\\'t belong in that department.*\\n\\nLike I said this happened a few years ago when I was still pretty new and I have since not made the same mistake again and have improved. I now train people for the job and I am also a assistant supervisor of the department. I usually tell newbies this story when I am training them so they don\\'t make the same mistake as I did (which would be hard to do because it requires a certain level of dumbass and social awkwardness to achieve this). Also so they can realize that some of the interactions that they have with customers could be a lot worse. \\n \\n*Did you ever apologize to the guy?*\\n\\nNo, and that\\'s the one thing I regret most of all. I\\'ve never seen him come back to the store after this happened. I truly wish him all the best and hope he is doing better.\\n\\nAnyway, thanks for reading my post guys. While I\\'m sure this made some of your cringe, hope y\\'all have a good day!\\n\\nTL;DR - Subtly implied to a customer that he was old and told him that he must be proud of his dead daughter and that it sucks that she\\'s dead. Few years back I was a bit drunk and saw online that the \"Red Hot Chili Pipers\" were playing in Edinburgh...I thought it was the Red Hot Chili Peppers! £30 for a ticket I thought it was a bargain! Bought two tickets one for me and one for my girlfriend (at the time).\\n\\nI am a huge fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers and I was super stoked to finally see them in Edinburgh! Most bands play in Glasgow so I couldnt believe my luck when I saw they were playing in my city!\\n\\nSo we turned up full of excitement really ready to get into the music and then I heard some bagpipe music was playing.\\n\\nI thought hmm interesting...not what I expected from a warm up act but seeing as we are in Scotland and the capital city I really did not think it was anything out of the usual.\\n\\nAbout an hour in I was getting a bit impatient, the music was great with good vibes but I was waiting for the Red Hot Chili Peppers to come out so I could do a bit of headbanging to some sweet guitar riffs!\\n\\nI turned to the man next to me and asked when the Red Hot Chili Peppers were coming on he laughed and said \"aye pal good joke eh\"\\n\\nIt was at this moment I realised I was not going to see the Red Hot Chili Peppers.\\n\\nTL;DR: bought tickets to the Red Hot Chili Pipers thinking it was the Red Hot Chili Peppers.\\n\\nEdit: changed “bought two tickets one for me and one for my ex gf” to “bought two tickets one for me and one for my girlfriend (at the time)” to let redditors know I am now single and available.  So here\\'s the deal, my friends and I made a cannabis cake containing 8g of good flower. So I kinda forgot about it and left a piece in the fridge, to my surprise I come home today and the piece is gone.\\n\\nWhat should I tell them. Or should I tell them at all? They are anti cannabis.\\n\\nHelp.\\n\\nUpdate: My father found a joint in the ash tray and I just said it\\'s from my friends. He said that cannabis is a shit drug and doesn\\'t want me to smoke this \"shit\". Well if he would know that he just had a piece of \"shit\" cake...\\n\\nUpdate 2: My father is going around our house with a candle and Christian church songs. I\\'m holding my laugh back\\n\\nUpdate 3: My mom just made burgers for us and my dad never ate a single one apart from those like from McDonald\\'s (2 times). He said that it\\'s the most delicious thing he has ever eaten.\\n\\nUpdate 4: My dad is just chilling right now and talking with my mum. My mum, I think, hasn\\'t felt anything. \\nWill update tomorrow. Good night folks. \\n\\nUpdate 5: I talked a little bit with my parents and they don\\'t seem to suspect anything. Guess I got away. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL:DR: my parents ate my cannabis infused cake and my father is having a good time \\nThis happened just a few hours ago. Using my actual account because my husband will know it’s me and there’s no way around this embarrassment. Hi sweetie. \\n\\nOn with the fuck up. It’s my first time voting and I’m dropping off my ballot. I’m thinking about how nice it is that I did my part as a citizen, and oooohhh stickers! I took more than one and I noticed the large circle was about the same size as my areolas. The wheels in my head start to turn. I get home and strip all my clothes off. I’m feeling quite patriotic as I censor my teets with these sticky knockoff nipple covers. \\n\\nWhile my husband is on the phone, I lift up my bra to show off my work. He makes a face. I know this face. I’m reeling him in. I push a little further. I squeeze them together, wiggle them a little, and do whatever necessary to get the D. He hangs up the phone and gives in to my tempting ways. I start to go down on him for a while. Then I move to give him a taste of what’s underneath the sticker. I start to peel it off. FUUUUCK. \\n\\nThat shit is STUCK on there. Trying to keep a brave face, I lift it again, but the sticker has latched on to my nipples like a baby. Should I rip it off like a bandaid? Sweet lady liberty NO! Ladies, do not rip anything off your nipples. Actually, take my advice and don’t be stupid enough to put stickers on your nips in the first place. I end up hopping in a hot shower praying they come off. One of them rips in the middle down my nipple. When I pull on both, my nipple is stretch sideways almost bringing me to tears. After taking the time to slowly lift it, it finally comes off. I will now treat them extra special and put oil on them or something. Never again. Not even to get dicked down. \\n\\nThe foredaddies of this country, would be ashamed.\\n\\nTLDR; I put I Voted stickers on my nipples for the sake of getting in my husband’s pants. It was painful to remove. Don’t do this no matter how sexy. I regret all of my decisions from the past 2 hours.\\n\\nEdit: My top post is a fuck up about my boobs lmao! Thank you for my first awards internet friends 💛\\nI would like to address some things. \\n1) I’m married, so no I will not send pics of my breasts. I ask kindly that stop messaging me about it. \\n2) Believe this story is real or don’t. I couldn’t care less. I know it happened and I don’t need anonymous people on the internet trying to discredit my story. I’m sure lots of you have more important things to do than cry to the mods over this.  \\n3) Sorry if my 5 erotic sentences awakened something in you or offended you. I would suggest putting away your torches and pitchforks and moving on. \\n4) If people are so adamant on trying this out, fine. Don’t say I didn’t warn you. I used those big red circular stickers in Utah. The O in voted has an image of the state of Utah around it and a checkmark in a box on the bottom. I kept it on for like 20 minutes total and put them on when they were soft and unaroused. I’m not sure how true this is, but i’m pretty sure women have more sensitive, pliable nipples than men. At least that’s the case for my husband and I. Maybe I just have very sensitive nipples. I don’t know. So I don’t think this would work for everyone. Anyways, enjoy. You’ve learned nothing. This actually happened about thirty minutes ago and I still can\\'t process it.\\n\\nSo my fiancée and I live together in our house and because of the whole quarantine thing, she was worried about her mother being all alone so we invited her to stay with us and she agreed. A bit awkward at first but she\\'s good company and passed the awkward stage within two days.\\n\\nYah so I woke up this morning and my fiancée wasn\\'t in bed but I could hear the shower in our bathroom. Feeling a bit frisky, I decided to join her and maybe play around a bit. Got fully naked and ready to go. I opened the door and the speakers in the bathroom were playing music and then it hit me. Maybe I should tiptoe in and seductively start kissing from behind like in the movies. It looks hot there so maybe it\\'ll be the same in real life right? So I stealthily made it into the shower and wrapped my arms around \\'my fiancée\\'. When she screamed I just started laughing (second wrong move) and said in a deep voice, \"it\\'s just me baby\" and tried again. It was only when she shouted my name and told me to get the fuck out I realized that it was actually her mother. Since I\\'m a slow idiot, I just stood there for about 5 seconds just staring at her as she covered herself before apologizing and running out.\\n\\nI\\'m sitting in my car in the garage right now typing this and I still don\\'t know where my fiancée is or why the fuck her mother was showering in our private bathroom instead of the house bathroom. So that\\'s my life right now and I don\\'t know how I\\'ll live through this.\\n\\nTl;dr I woke up and thought I should join my fiancée in the shower but it turned out to be her mother. My life is over.\\n\\nEDIT: I didn\\'t realize it wasn\\'t my fiancée sooner because the both of them literally look like sisters. Her mother doesn\\'t age at all and they share the same hair color and body type(for lack of a better word).\\n\\nUPDATE: After spending the past hours across the street with my friend building up confidence, I finally went back home and found both of them sitting on the couch. I first went up to kiss my fiance and greet her but she sort of turned her cheek as I came (I was bloody sweating bricks at this point) and said something around the lines of \"So my mother says you two had quite the morning\". *Holy shit*, I can\\'t even explain how scared I was since they both looked serious so I just started explaining my side of the story. When all was said, they both kind of looked at each other then broke into laughter. Apparently her en suite\\'s shower had terrible pressure this morning so my fiance said she could try ours.\\n\\nSo basically we\\'re back in the awkward phase and her mother can barely look me in the eye and though my fiance says she\\'s fine with it and understands, I can tell she\\'s a bit angry/disturbed by the fact her mother and we saw each other naked and also that I didn\\'t realize it wasn\\'t her soon. Needless to say I\\'ll never surprise my fiance in the shower ever again. My kids go trick or treating. We live in a great candy neighborhood, so every year they come home with 100-200 pieces. \\n\\nWhen they’re young we tell them Santa brings every boy and girl a present on Halloween and the more candy you leave him, the better a present he’d leave in exchange. \\n\\nWhen the kids get old enough to realize Santa is a hoax, that’s when we start paying in cash. 25 cents per piece. \\n\\nDid this with our oldest two and it worked great. They’d give up about 3/4 of their candy and buy a toy. \\n\\nOur third child is 8 this year so called us out on the Santa thing. We explained the new deal. \\n\\nHe said “So then it’s my money and I can buy *whatever* I want with it? A new skateboard even? *Anything*?” “You bet.” “Swear?” “Yep.” \\n\\nHe goes and brings us **all** his candy. Even every Kit Kat, his favorite. I was shocked, but he’d been saving up for a skateboard for a bit so must’ve decided to go all in to push his savings over the edge. \\n\\nGetting all the sugar out of his room was a best case scenario, easiest $31.75 I’d spent all week. \\n\\nNext day I brought the candy to work. Then we went to Walmart after school and the kids ran to pick out their stuff. We met at the check out. \\n\\nThere’s my son, who has raided the clearance aisle and found two hundred Kit Kats for $10.00. \\n\\nI started to tell him to put it back, but he said “What? You said I could buy *whatever* I wanted! You swore! I want my candy back then.” \\n\\nHis candy had already been eaten by my coworkers. And I did swear, and we put a lot of emphasis on the importance of keeping your word. \\n\\nSo... my son has almost twice as much candy as he would have from just keeping his trick or treating... and a new skateboard. \\n\\nI don’t know who’s more pissed, my wife that this plan backfired so horrifically, or his older brothers that they never thought to do this. \\n\\n*tl;dr I bought my son’s Halloween candy back from him to get the sugar out of the house. He spent the money on twice as much candy as he had gotten trick or treating.*\\n\\nEdit: Thanks to everyone for all these awards! This actually did happen today at about 2am. \\nTL;DR at the bottom\\n\\nMy dad is out of town so I’m home alone this week. I was up really late because I fucked up and didn’t do this assignment that was due in the morning. \\n\\nI was starting to get really tired so I decided to get a little hit of caffeine. I went down to the garage because we have an extra fridge there and I grabbed a soda. I walked back to the door to go inside but the door wouldn’t budge. \\n\\nThis is when I realized I fucked up, because not only did I just lock myself out of the house with no shirt, no keys and no phone. I also failed to remember that my home security system was armed. \\n\\nRight as I finished that thought: \\n\\n“WooooOOOOOooo WooooOOOOOooo!” \\n\\nMy surprisingly loud security system went off (there’s a 30 second delay to allow someone to punch in the security code before it goes off).  I start panicking and trying to force the door open so I can shut the alarm off. I realized that wasn’t gonna work and just started pacing and freaking the fuck out. It took longer than I’m proud of realize that I’m in a garage and I can just open the garage door. \\n\\nAfter I raised the garage I ran to the front door and... locked. Of course. Fortunately for me though there’s 3 other doors on the side and back of the house that I could get into the house from, unfortunately for me those too were locked. I defaulted back to stress pacing until I decided fuck it, the cops will be here soon and maybe they can help me. Well, I was half right. \\n\\nI open the side gate and walk back to the front of the house when all the sudden someone screams at me “STOP! LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS!” I freeze up in fear because I’m realizing that two cops who are responding to a home invasion are now pointing a gun at me, the weird shirtless guy coming from the backyard. \\n\\nI complied with their orders and explained that I live here, I just set off the alarm and locked myself out. They looked up the homeowner, my dad, and gave him a call. Needless to say, my dad wasn’t too happy to be receiving a call from the police at 2am asking if the dumbass who locked himself out of his own house was his son. \\n\\nOnce they were satisfied that I lived there, one officer brought out this device that just sort of popped the door open for me. I thanked them, shut the alarm off, and used the adrenaline coursing through my veins to bust out the remainder of my homework. \\n\\nTL;DR: I was home alone late at night and got a drink from the garage, not realizing that I locked myself out and that I just set off the alarm. While I was trying to find a way into my house the police showed up and pointed a gun at me, thinking I was trying to break in. This happened just moments ago.\\n\\nI have a co-worker that works in a separate department.  In my old position we had to communicate fairly regularly, but since changing positions I rarely see him.  It has been about a year and a half since I have seen him and I was surprised to see him in my area today.  He has lost about a hundred pounds so I thought it would be a nice gesture to recognize and compliment him.  I said it was good to see him again and rather enthusiastically told him he looks great and to keep up the hard work.  He responded with a cold smile, said it was nice running into me, and just continued walking.  We aren\\'t incredibly close but we usually stop for small talk, which I was completely expecting as I awkwardly stood in the hallway.  \\n\\nWhen I got back into my office I brought up the weight loss to my office-mate and said our coworker really looked great, and he was inspiring.  My office-mate somberly responded that he was diagnosed with cancer and has been losing the weight because of that.  \\n\\nTL;DR I enthusiastically complimented a co-worker about his weight loss, got a cold response, then learned he was diagnosed with cancer. Standard not today, but 4 yrs ago.\\n\\nSo when my wife and i first started dating (7yrs now) she was fairly naive to the world. She grew up in a strict southern Baptist environment and was never allowed to date, watch certain things, etc. etc.\\n\\nShe moved out of her parent\\'s house in 2013 at 21yrs old. I met her 7 yrs ago on oct. 28th. We started talking and messaging each other things fairly quickly and getting frisky. \\n\\nNow I\\'ve never done this with anyone else, but because she was very innocent to various pop culture references i decided to give it a try. During one of our early make out sessions... without knowing a lick of french aside from Dexter\\'s Labratory (yes my dear reader we are going there.) I proceded to whisper the phrase \"omelette du fromage\" into her ear... this turned her on immensely.\\n\\nSo for 3 solid years this went on until I F\\'d Up and told her what the phrase meant... ever since then i\\'ve regretted telling her (and she never thought to look it up) because i always got a kick out of it.\\n\\nomelette du fromage = cheese omelette \\n\\nMarried for 6 years this past June so i did something right!\\n\\nTL:DR - For 3 solid years my girlfriend and then wife got weak in the knees to me whispering cheese omelette into her ear because she had no clue what \"omelette du fromage\" actually meant.\\n\\n---------------------------------edit-line----------------------------------------\\n\\nEdit: forgot to add that she in fact HATES cheese.\\n\\nEdit2: Thanks for all the laughs and first awards lol. My wife and i are both laughing because we\\'ve held off on posting this, but it\\'s a hilarious story.\\n\\nEdit3: I\\'ve only seen a few (2-3) nay sayers. I can fully assure you that this is infact true. It\\'s still hilarious to this day that i managed to go for so long and give her the feels by using a cheesy line ;)... did i mention we have 2 kids? So dad joke included at no extra charge.\\n\\nEdit4: I am aware it\\'s not actually omelette du fromage. However it\\'s parodied from Dexter\\'s Laboratory as i have stated above. I implore you to google or youtube omelette du fromage, and you will be enlightened.\\n\\nEdit5: elvisharchercrafts is indeed my wife. Prior to today she has never been on reddit. \\n\\n* she did not create her profile to drum up business, we are both horrible at naming so she just used her business page.\\n* I do own a business myself, but i believe it would go against TOS to go into detail on that despite the fact that I\\'d love to drum up business.\\n* If it is against tos I\\'ll delete because ive had a couple people ask. --- I do credit card processing and 100% elimnate fees for the merchant privately owned and large to keep them afloat, especially these days.\\n\\nElvisharcher and myself did not anticipate the huge interest of this story. It\\'s been fun! Sadly i don\\'t think i have many other funny stories that come to mind. I\\'m glad it brought a smile to quite a few of y\\'all! *Throwaway account because that\\'s where this fuck up deserves to be buried.* \\n\\nThis happened yesterday. I was watching porn on my phone, one of those daddy/daughter videos. I will state, for the record, I do not advocate incest. My girlfriend however was all about that role play life and wanted me to be in \"bad dad\" mode when she sees me this weekend. All I wanted was to be the best bad dad she ever had, so I went on pornhub for some incest-inspiration. That\\'s all this was. Research. \\n\\nSo, the \"daughter\" was just about to climb on the cock that supposedly spit her ass out when all of a sudden my own fucking father phones me. Of all people. If there was a camera in my room, that would have been that moment I look straight into it. I answered the phone. The old man said he needed me to come pick him up at the airport because my brother, who was supposed to fetch him, wasn\\'t answering his damn phone.\\n\\nCut to my dad and I driving home, catching up, roasting each other, you know, wholesome father/son shit. Then, there came the silence. It wasn\\'t the awkward kind. But I guess we just kinda said enough at the time. My father, who\\'s super religious btw, took the silence as an opportunity to switch on the car radio and tune in to his favourite gospel station. He was in the mood to get jiggy with Jeezy. But instead of hearing voices worshipping the OG upstairs, we heard the distinct sounds of bodies smacking against each other, moans of pleasure, and of course, the coital Q&A: \\n\\n*\"You like fucking me don\\'t cha, daddy?\"* \\n\\n*\"Arrrrggggghhhh.... yeah... \"* \\n\\nMy old man unknowingly activated the car\\'s Bluetooth, which immediately connected to my phone, and began playing whatever I was listening to last. In this case, it was fucking incest porn. Now, I never closed the video before I left the house, but I did pause the motherfucker. Yet, somehow, my phone went Skynet all over my dumbass ass and auto played that traumatic shit.\\n\\nI frantically turned off the \"radio\" and did what I do best in extremely uncomfortable situations, prevent eye contact at all cost. \\n\\nDad: Suppose that\\'s one way of bringing up the birds and the bees conversation with your kids. \\n\\nMe: \\n\\nI immediately contemplated crashing the car just to escape the cringy silence between me and my dad for the rest of the drive home. \\n\\n^^Siri ^^might ^^have ^^sabotaged ^^me\\n\\n**TL:DR Drove my dad home. Accidentally blasted incest porn over the Bluetooth speaker. The end.** During my second year at my current school, I (25 m) was teaching a cover lesson. Normally, during a cover lesson im a lot more relaxed since the work is usually simple and the kids know it\\'s just trying to fill the hour. I got chatting with a couple of students about reddit and talked about a post I\\'d made which i thought was fairly ambiguous and buried, and totally SFW anyway. The students i was talking to were two lads, both around 14 or 15 and both pretty nice kids, who i have a good relationship with. Little did i know, one of them would go all super sleuth and track down the post. It must\\'ve taken him ages, since the post was at least 4 months old at this point, and my username contained nothing related to anything i could be identified by. A couple of days later, i see one of the lads on the corridor, and he says \"what would you if you were a girl for a day, sir?\". At first,i have no idea what he\\'s talking about, but then his smirk helps the horror melt into my brain. A day or two previous i had rather immaturely answered that question on askreddit with \"fingerblast myself into oblivion\". After a mad dash across the school to the staffroom, which is the only place in the school that i get signal, my reddit account was no more.\\n\\nTL;DR - I idiotically gave a student an in to finding my reddit, which he found, then cleverly teased me with a pretty immature and vulgar post I\\'d made a couple days previous, resulting in the end of my reddit account with all my sweet sweet internet points.\\n\\nEdit: thanks for the awards and reimbursing my lost sweet sweet internet points. Also, as many of you have pointed out, im aware that he may see this. Oh well. Ill repost from my new account  next week and the cycle can continue So this is an old story, from when I was about 11, so somewhere in the early 2000\\'s. I was working on my homework in my room, when suddenly an unrelated question came to mind. Considering my dad is pretty knowledgeable I decide to ask him for the answer. I walk into the living room where my parents are watching television. Since this is before you could simply pause your show, or at least before that technology was common, I decide to ask my dad if its okay to interrupt his show, thinking he would tell me to wait till a commercial or something.\\nMe: \"Dad, is it okay if I ask you a question?\"\\nMy dad stiffens and slowly turns his head to look at me. He looks a bit pale and stricken, \"W-what?\"\\nMe: \"I was wondering, if you aren\\'t busy, if I can ask you a question?\"\\nDad: \"Uh, yeah... just... go wait in my room.\"\\nI happily go to my parents bedroom, the only other room with a TV, and turn it on as I wait.\\n\\nThis next part is my mom\\'s perspective, which she shared with me years later. She was still focused on the show, unaware of my dad and I\\'s conversation, when the TV suddenly turns off. She looks at my dad in confusion and asks whats going on. Without looking at her, he says in a shaky breath, \"Our son has... questions.\" She eventually figures that my dad believes I want to ask him about sex, and that he has to give me the \\'sex talk\\'. They spend a few minutes discussing what to talk to me about, and preparing for whatever questions I might have. She bolsters his confidence and sends him off to talk to me.\\n\\nI\\'m watching TV in my parent\\'s room, completely unaware of what\\'s about to happen. My dad enters, turns off the TV, and rigidly sits on the bed next to me. He clears his throat, \"Well, son, what questions do you have for me?\"\\nMe: \"Okay, well, are there #1 pencils? They always say \\'use a #2 pencil\\' at school, but I\\'ve never heard of any other number. Do they exist, and how are they different?\" \\nMy dad slumps over onto his knees. He stares at the floor for a solid 30 seconds of silence. Finally, he takes in a deep breath and sits back up and answers my question. (For those who are curious it has to do with the quality/softness of the graphite in the pencil.)\\nMe: \"Okay, cool, thanks dad.\" I stand up to leave, but he puts a hand on my shoulder to sit back down. \"Wait a minute, there\\'s something else I wanted to talk to you about.\"\\nHe proceeds to give me the \\'sex talk\\'. It wasn\\'t anything overtly graphic, focusing mostly on puberty and biological changes I can expect. But it comes so out of left-field for me that I am completely bowled over. He finishes talking and asks me, \"So, do you have anymore questions for me?\". I reply \"No, no more questions\" as i shuffle back to my room. I sit down at my desk and stare at the pencil that started this, while I can hear my mom\\'s cackling laughter in the living room as my dad tells her what happened.\\n\\nTLDR: Asked my dad a question about pencils, got the sex talk as a bonus. My wife has extremely sensitive skin and she has always\\xa0struggled\\xa0with it. I\\'ve never cared about her having acne despite her being really\\xa0insecure\\xa0about it. She has seen\\xa0countless\\xa0dermatologists and other\\xa0professionals\\xa0trying to get rid of it to no avail.\\n\\nWe have a small drying rack thing for our cleaning sponge in our bathroom.\\xa0It\\'s where\\xa0a\\xa0square\\xa0cleaning sponge is kept and it\\'s used to\\xa0quickly\\xa0clean the counters and mirrors if needed. Pretty\\xa0handy\\xa0right? My wife got it for us, she is so awesome coming up with these things.\\xa0\\n\\nWell I was in the bathroom today and saw that my wife had bought a new cleaning sponge. But it was a super weird egg shaped sponge. I found this\\xa0eggsponge\\xa0hilarious and asked my wife why she would get such a weird shaped sponge and not just a normal square one. She told me it would be easier to use than the old one to put makeup on.\\n\\nWhat. My wife uses our cleaning sponge for makeup. I don\\'t understand. She saw the confusion on my face and asked me what\\'s wrong. I asked her why she would use our cleaning sponge for her face.\\n\\nI don\\'t know anything about makeup. Did you know that people who wear makeup use a sponge to spread the makeup on their face? Well I didn\\'t. But now I do, my wife made sure to explain that to me very carefully.\\n\\nI\\xa0had used\\xa0my wifes makeup sponge for cleaning. She used that same sponge on her face and we believe that\\xa0that\\'s\\xa0the reason for her\\xa0reacuring\\xa0acne. The wife is not happy and I feel horrible.\\xa0\\nI asked her why was it on a drying rack and not in her makeup bag. To let it dry out after use obviously. She\\xa0didn\\'t\\xa0want any bacteria growing on the moist sponge which could happen if she left it in her bag. Great thinking! If only I didn\\'t make it a nest for bacteria by cleaning with it.\\n\\nI went out and bought her a bunch of new sponges all different shapes and sizes, but not the square ones. I hope she can forgive my dumbass soon.\\xa0\\n\\nTldr; My wife has acne she can\\'t get rid of. I had accidentally used her makeup sponge to clean the bathroom for years. She has used that same sponge on her face and we believe that has caused her acne. I am an idiot\\n\\nEdit: Thank you everyone for the\\xa0skin care\\xa0advice and kind words. I\\'ll be sure to tell my wife about it all. I\\'m\\xa0definitely\\xa0going to have to buy more than just sponges for her so thanks for all the suggestions too. To answer a few\\xa0questions\\xa0that keep getting asked: My wife likes her privacy while using the bathroom when she gets\\xa0ready\\xa0in the morning. She doesn\\'t use make up that\\xa0often\\xa0because apparently\\xa0that\\'s\\xa0bad for her face. So I\\'ve never really seen her using her makeup sponge or then I\\'ve been too\\xa0absent-minded\\xa0to notice. I guess I\\'m not the sharpest tool in the shed. The makeup sponge I had mistaken as a cleaning sponge was a square one. They come in sheets and you just take one square piece out of it, honestly just like you would take out a cleaning sponge.\\xa0Thats\\xa0the best explanation I have for them I hope that makes it more clear. So this didn’t happen today but has been happening for my entire adult life. However I DID come to the realisation today.\\n\\nFor context, I grew up in New Zealand and now live in Australia.\\n\\nI’ve always loved Mexican and American foods, and over the years I’ve added quite a few recipes to my go-to list. One of those being chili.\\n\\nI’m definitely a fan of spice, and I always thought I could handle it, but the all the recipes I found for chili ended up being mind blowingly spicy. Like, tears running down my face, nose running, can’t feel my tongue spicy. I do enjoy this level of spice from time to time as the rush I get is like a drug. I just thought that’s what chili was supposed to be like, as all the recipies I’ve tried called for a similar amount of chili powder.\\n\\nHowever today, after finding a new recipe I wanted to try, I decided to actually read the blog post that came before it instead of scrolling past it like I normally do. Today was the day that I realised that what we call chilli powder is not what Americans call chili powder.\\n\\nIn New Zealand, chilli powder is pure dried chillies. And here I was thinking that the spelling difference was just an American English thing...\\n\\nI found out today that for the past 13 years I’ve been loading my chili with about 50x more ground chilli than the recipe calls for....\\n\\ntl;dr: I thought when the recipe called for chili powder it meant 100% pure ground dried chillies and loaded my chili with about 50x more spice than the recipe called for.\\n\\n**edit: For clarification, the chili powder the recipe called for was a mix of cayenne, paprika, cumin, onion powder, garlic powder and oregano**\\n\\n**edit: Just as a disclaimer, this specifically refers to American recipies that call for chili powder (one L), don’t go putting this stuff in your curry** First off, I‘m pretty sure no one reads the related keywords for porn as long as the title and thumbnail are appealing. But if y’all do, then you’re smart. \\n\\nThis has only happened once to me but after this happened... I’ll just say, I learned my motherfucking lesson and it ain’t happening again. Those titles can be a bit UN-DESCRIPTIVE as HELL apparently and I’m about to tell y’all why I now have god damn trust issues. \\n\\nI was at home relaxing and missing my man because he was at work and I was horny. So I did what anyone would do in that situation and pulled out the old iPad/vibrator combo and started scanning for hot videos. I watched a good bit of videos. Some good, some boring. But all were fine, ya know? until this one video... this one video. I won’t go into full detail on what all was in it but all you need to know for now is there was anal in it. I clicked this video bc it had a very generic title like “hardcore anal session with petite blonde Susie floozy” (not the exact name but u get the point) and a generic thumbnail. \\n\\nSo, ya know, I was expecting a generic video. Either way I’m already close at this point and need to let it rip. \\n\\nIt was normal, at first. and I was getting into it. I was ready to GO. You know when you’re in that perfect spot like a few moments from when you’re about to cum? Where nothing matters to you at all except what you are doing right the fuck now? The house could catch on fire and your ass ain’t moving till you finish? You aren’t mad at anything in the world. Perfect bliss and desperation. Yea, that’s where I was at.\\n\\nUntil it happened... that fateful moment when my orgasm became Game Of Thrones. It started out amazing and then it was taken away and quickly ruined for good. \\n\\nAs this pornstar is getting piled-drived into oblivion over the couch....... \\n\\nshe. starts. shitting herself. \\n\\nA lot. Everywhere. And a lot. And did I mention it was EVERYWHERE?? OR that she was shitting herself?? I froze dead in my tracks in shock and then I became even more shocked when the guy KEPT GOING... He liked it...... He started saying shit like “Mm oh damn baby you couldn’t hold it in could you?” \\n\\n...\\n\\nI closed my iPad fast as hell and just sat there, cold, and dead inside. Winter had come, but not me. There was no chance it was coming back either, not after that. \\n\\nSo Pornhub- There is no need to trick a bitch. When the kink is that extreme, put it in the title ffs. \\n\\nAnd lastly, my fellow Redditors- check the god damn tags/description on a porn next time you’re watching it. Also make sure to exit that shit out before your boyfriend gets home so he doesn’t use your iPad and then be scared to touch you for a week bc he thinks you wanna shit on his dick. \\n\\n(TIFU update: first off, I don’t have a link guys, I’m sorry :( \\nsecondly, I’m sorry I said “allot” lol, I’m illiterate and had no idea that was improper until I saw the comments so thank you to those of you who brought it to my attention. \\nAnd finally, how tf did this blow up like it did?? I honestly expected this to be taken down when I posted it, I sure as hell didn’t expect 38k upvotes. You guys rock, thank you for the upvotes!)\\n\\nTLDR: I tried to relax and watch porn, but didn’t properly check the tags and ended up pranking myself with shit porn, killing an orgasm and then making my boyfriend think I wanted to shit on him. This has been going on for two months and I just found out today. Throwaway account because many know my real account and I don’t feel like getting roasted for 3 years about this. \\n\\nSo I signed up for tinder after breaking up with my girlfriend a few months ago. I set up my account...set my interest in ‘women’ and started swiping. Now when I signed up for tinder I linked my Facebook account and apparently my dumbass 13 year old self thought it would be funny if I set my gender to woman. I had completely forgot. I’m not a terrible looking guy and have had success on other apps, but I was getting barely any matches and couldn’t figure out why. Figured the algorithms were just screwing me. Over the course of the two months I would think “wow short hair must be the new thing” or “so many bisexuals on here” but never really thought anything beyond that. Then this morning I woke up to a new match. She said I looked great, to which I replied thanks, you too! But then she replied with...”how long ago did you transition?” I thought she was talking about puberty...but she was not. That’s when it all came together and I realized I’ve been swiping on lesbians the entire time.\\n\\nTldr; My 13 year-old self is an asshole.\\n\\nEDIT: I AM NOT 13 YEARS OLD, THAT’S WHEN I MADE A FACEBOOK. I AM 25. Now, it should be noted, this story happened when I was much younger. Yeah I get it I was a dumb kid, you don’t need to remind me.\\n\\nI’ve always been a very curious person and have procured information that I often will never need. One of the best ways to gain knowledge is to ask questions, so I do, A lot. Sometimes it’s for the better, often it’s for the worse.\\n\\nlets cut to the chase.\\n\\nin third grade, there were 4 classes, one of these had two teachers, one for the morning, and one for the afternoon. The one we will be speaking about today is my afternoon teacher. her name was Mrs. “Virgin”\\n\\nat The time, I thought a “Virgin” was someone originally from the Virgin Island, if you are from America, You’re American. If you’re from Canada you are Canadian. Britian? British. Makes sense right? So when I thought about her name, curiosity got the best of me. So I waddled up to my teacher blissfully unaware and stated the dire inquiry\\n\\nMe: Mrs. Virgin, I have a question.\\n\\nMrs Virgin: Go ahead sweetie\\n\\nAnd then, I ask it.\\n\\n”Are you a virgin”\\n\\nShe gasps, Stares at me for a moment, Regains her composure, grabs my shoulder and says “Not an appropriate question.”\\n\\nI, still unaware of what I had just asked simply said ”okay” and waddled off to the bus\\n\\nAs I rode home I had wondered what I had said wrong. It was in the back of my mind so I eventually forgot about it, until a couple years ago, when I remembered the story and realized what I had asked. I swore to myself I would never tell a soul, but here I am, bored and typing a story to 16.5 million people. Hope you enjoyed my suffering.\\n\\nTL;DR dumb kid asks if teacher is a virgin\\n\\nEdit: wupti-doo Looks like I got feature on R/slash, what a treat. Thanks everyone! This happened about a week ago. It still gives me shivers.\\n\\nObviously, I never thought this would happen to me of all people.\\n\\nI spent a lot of money on the app store and I think they blocked my card and so I had to call them up to restore my account.\\n\\nA female representative picked up and said she was going to ask a few recovery questions to verify my identity. Even at this point I had no clue what was coming. Until she asked,\\n\\n\"What is your most prized possession?\"\\n\\nI froze. My head goes blank not because I forgot what I had written for the answer, but because I knew exactly what I had written. The answers were all the same, all the time... \\'dong schlong\\'.\\n\\nI wanted to hang up right then and there, but I knew she was looking at the answer I had written.\\n\\nSo, I mustered up the courage and said in a soft voice,\\n\\n\"uh... ^(dong schlong)\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m sorry? You have to speak up sir, I can\\'t hear you well.\"\\n\\n\"... dong ...schlong... like big peepee (FUCK), you know schlong dong, dong schlong (FUCKING KILL ME)\"\\n\\n\"Dong schlong. Thank you, sir.\"\\n\\nI was surprised she didn\\'t crack up or anything and was very professional.\\n\\nI\\'ve sinced changed all my restore passwords to something else than \\'dong scholong\\'.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR: I wrote my recovery password as \\'dong schlong\\', and I had to confirm it to the customer service rep. on the phone that it was indeed, \\'dong schlong\\'.\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nHoly mother of schlong this blew up... Thank you kind sir/ma\\'am for the shiny silver!\\n\\nAnd yes, looking back, I should\\'ve definitely owned it, like one of the comments mentioned. But this had never happened to me and I think I just panicked. I\\'ll remember to be confident about my profane recovery names next time.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT2:   \\nGOLD?? PLATINUM? Seriously?? Wow, you guys made my day. I\\'ll make sure to keep my shiny medals clean and sparkling :) This happened just today. I (male) was in a lingerie store with my girlfriend, she was shopping for new underwear and I was just following her around, bored as always, staring at my phone to keep myself occupied.\\n\\nAfter about 5-10 minutes a man grabs my arm, I turn and it\\'s the security guard. He asks me to leave and starts escorting me towards the exit. I\\'m confused about what\\'s happening and look around for my girlfriend, who I can\\'t find.\\n\\nApparently at some point, while not paying attention to anything other than my phone, I\\'d stopped following my girlfriend (who was wearing a white cardigan and black trousers) and instead had started following some other random woman who was wearing similar clothes. I\\'d apparently been doing this for at least a few minutes, silently standing closely behind her as she browsed underwear and following her to do it again as she tried to move away. She\\'d alerted a member of staff with a horrified look towards them.\\n\\nTL;DR Started following a stranger who I thought was my girlfriend and creeped them out So this happened last night and I’m not sure how this is going to end.  I’d like to begin by stating I am not a perv. That being said, I may have done something pervy and I now hate myself. This fuck up is innocent enough, I think, but the implications are terrible. I’ll let you be the judge. \\n\\nSo yesterday my lovely, beautiful, 35 year old wife went to her grandmothers house to help clean out her old room. She lived with her in her high school years because her mother moved away and she didn’t want to change schools, so she stayed. Her room at grandmas has gone pretty much untouched since she moved in with me, 16 years ago. Anyways, she got home late last night and was very excited to show me some of her treasures for decades past that she recovered from her childhood bedroom.  Unfortunately her show-and-tell session coincided with a playoff game so she did not have my undivided attention (even though the Titans clearly had it in the bag, you have to watch until the end just in case). She showed me her sketch book, (very nice dear, you could have been an artist) an article she wrote that was published in a local newspaper (wow babe, you coulda been a journalist... FUMBLE!) and some other stuff. Then she breaks out a dusty photo album from the good old days of disposable cameras. I got detailed history of every picture of her, her friends, her siblings, people she doesn’t even remember, places that no longer exist... I was not paying attention. I’ll admit that. She flipped through page after page as she sat beside me on the couch and I glanced at the pictures, and gave my obligatory “that’s nice” or “wow, look at that” response. \\n\\nEverything was going peachy. Until she flipped the page, and said “this is a picture of me at the beach” and I glanced. And it was her in a bikini. Her, my wife, in a bikini. I said “daaaaaamn”. And looked back at the TV. Silence from her. I feel something is wrong. I can feel her eyes on the side my face. I said the wrong thing. What did I do? I risk a peek at her face; she is shocked. I have obviously grown a grotesque second head on my shoulder, because the look on her face could not be the result of anything less. \\n\\n“What?” I ask stupidly. \\n\\nWhat the FUCK does that mean? I show you a picture of me when I was 15 FUCKING YEARS OLD and you say “daaaaaamn?” You find that fucking attractive?! You are disgusting! I have no answer, I just kinda look at her wishing she’d start laughing at let me know she’s fucking with me. But no, the same expression of rage and disappointment. I don’t know what to do. I kinda stuttered out “but... but it’s you! You know... younger I guess but you’re hot. I’m sorry, you’ve always been hot. What the fuck am I supposed to say? She tells me that the little girl in the picture no longer exists, that’s it’s not her but a memory and that I am a weirdo. I have nothing to say, I just want this conversation to be over. There are 4 minutes left in the fourth quarter. I get the brilliant idea to say “look, I wasn’t paying attention let me see the picture again I’m sure you aren’t hot”. Smoooooth. \\n\\nI won’t go in to too much detail about the rest of the conversation but suffice it to say that I am sleeping on the couch and should apparently be on a list of folks to keep an eye on. All I wanted to do was watch football. \\n\\nTL;DR I saw a picture of my wife taken when she was 15 and suggested she was hot.\\n\\nEdit: I should add her Grandmother is being moved to Hospice care. She does not normally react this way but I think she is under a lot of stress. Also I have read your comments and agree that this has more to do with me ignoring her than me thinking she was a hottie at 15. She needs me to be there to listen to her and I blew it. Thanks for your feedback though it’s a lot to think about.\\n\\nEdit 2: hooray I made the front page. I wanted to update the folks who seem genuinely interested. My wife and I talked about it, we are doing just fine now. She is not crazy, not a bitch, and we’re not getting a divorce. Some of you also suggested her reaction may have been the result of a past trauma. She assured me this is not the case, she’s just stressed and was angry with me.\\nLastly, fellas... please stop suggesting that I did nothing wrong because you think it’s perfectly natural and ok to be attracted to teenage girls. It is not. I don’t care how “developed” they are. Stop it. \\n\\nFinal edit: sorry if I ghosted you guys. I took (some of) your advice and have been giving my wife my undivided attention. I am not used to this amount of attention or scrutiny, and honestly it’s been a mixed bag. It’s Reddit. I asked for it. But now that I’ve got it... I feel kinda like a young actress who wanted a private meeting with Harvey Weinstein. So I’ll try to read your 4K comments and reply to anyone who I feel might me waiting for one, but not now. Thanks for your support and advice. Thank you for mocking, trolling, and ridiculing me as well, it’s all in good fun. I hope. So I\\'ve spent the last 20 minutes hypervnetlating with laughter and I promised my wife I wouldn\\'t tell anyone we know because she\\'s a bit humiliated... so this is my way of getting it off my chest.\\n\\nSince lockdown, my wife and I have found a new appreciation of the garden. It isn\\'t big it, isnt pretty... but it\\'s a way to get outside and, given the cabin fever we\\'ve experienced, this is a nice form of escapism. We\\'ve always had a bird feeder that we topped up periodically... but with us both working from home, we\\'ve enjoyed watching the birds come and go. We got bladk birds, starlings, magpies and more pigeons than you could count. After a while we fed them by hand and now we can even get a few of them to sit on our hand and eat. Its therapeutic in a  weird way and naturally we\\'ve named some of them and so on. I really recommend it ( #berbs )\\n\\nAnyway, the wife asks a week ago if she can buy some more bird seed  - I said sure, sounds good. I should add my wife isn\\'t from a country that uses the metric system and she\\'s still getting used to it over here. I was in the room whilst she put the order in and - well - maybe when she said \"ooo is it ok if I get a fair bit, its cheaper that way?\" and \"ooo a selection for wild birds, shall I get some of that too?\" I didn\\'t do my due diligence. I thought \"what the hell, its not like it goes off. We can stick it in the garage\". When she told me how much it was, I was shocked but I assumed she got a few bits with the order (again, she is still adjusting to the price of things over here and everything is super expensive to her)\\n\\nSo  you can probably see where this is going... this morning a delivery arrived. My first clue should have been the size of the van that pulled up outside my house, ready to deliver 4 sacks of 12.5kg of birdseed. The delivery driver, from his safe social distance, lost his shit with laughter as my mind melted as he pulled sack after sack off his van. My wife was in a zoom meeting and when I finally got her attention revealed there\\'s still more to come that\\'s in transit and will arrive tomorrow. Turns out, for some reason, she thought it was 2.5kg to the lb.\\n\\nI don\\'t know if you can picture the amount of birdseed we have, but I\\'d say -- if we take into account how much is due to arrive tomorrow-  I\\'ll expect we have about the size of a small sofa. We have enough birdseed to last our entire lives, we can give it as inheritance after we die... from drowning in birdseed.\\n\\nWe\\'ve both spent a good part of the last hour crying with laughter amid our sacks. Every time I go into the hallway, I lose my shit a bit. After 6 weeks in lockdown I really think I might be losing my mind.\\n\\nThe best bit, we threw some into the garden and the birds don\\'t want to know. Little bastards.  \\n\\n\\n  \\nTL;DR My wife bought bird seed. She didn\\'t appreciate the nuances of the metric system and bought Pablo Escobar quanitites. The birds don\\'t like it. My house is full of it. I can\\'t.\\n\\n\\n\\nUPDATE- golly, this is what it feels like when Reddit goes bananas? My phone has been going crazy... Anyway, lots of people asked for photos - regrettably, I had already started breaking the sacks down so I cant do all of it.. but here is ONE of the FOUR sacks (12.5kg) we received... cant wait for more tomorrow! \\n Annoyingly its also the most compact of the sacks we got due to smaller seeds. The one with the peanuts was immense!\\n\\nOh and for 100% honesty I\\'m squeezing it a bit (Because it isn\\'t a solid mass to hold)... but believe me when I say I am satisfied I got the full amount we paid for, its a solid mass to carry. Also, hello lockdown hair!\\n\\n https://imgur.com/gallery/PdjInrR So basically, I had my gf over. She had met my family/parents and everything was good. My parents liked her. She liked my parents.\\n\\nI had never even had a girlfriend or anything before (at the time I was only 18) so my parents weren’t completely used to their son having a lady over.\\n\\nAnyway, so we’re upstairs in my bedroom and we start gettin a little freaky. Things escalate and we eventually start having sex. We were super quiet about it so that nobody would know. \\n\\nThis is where things get ~hilariously terrifying~.\\n\\nSo, I’m BALLS DEEP in my gf as she’s riding me, and my dad just casually walks into my room and essentially gets a full ass view of my gfs fuckin butthole and my willy half-way up main street. He’s so startled he makes one of this “DOH!” sounds like Homer Simpson y’know??? He quickly turns away pretending like he hadn’t seen anything. This all happened in less than 2 seconds. \\n\\nI can hear my mom downstairs say “Honey? What was that?!”\\n\\nMy dad, god bless his soul, replies “I... uhhh... stubbed my toe...” in the most defeated way possible.\\n\\nMy gf couldn’t look at my dad the same way again.\\n\\nI haven’t talked about it with my dad ever.\\n\\nedit: I still laugh my ass off telling this story to people.\\n\\ntldr: tifu by having sex w/ my gf while my parents were home and my dad walked in on us. He pretended his yelp of surprise was actually his stubbing of his toe. While attempting to get back in shape I\\'ve started power walking and doing short stints of jogging to try and build up my stamina. Today was an especially nice day so there were a lot of people out jogging and walking as well. As I was jogging up to an intersection a really attractive woman with a very fit butt happened to turn the corner and start walking the way I\\'d come. She was out walking a dog and ended up going the same direction as me. This coincidentally ended up being about the time I\\'d exhausted myself with jogging and started talking to catch my breath. I, being a guy, couldn\\'t help but take notice of her very nice rear end. I wasn\\'t trying to be a perv about it, nor did I plan on saying anything rude, I was just admiring. Well for whatever reason I happened to look over at the large dog she was walking with and was confronted with the large pair of dog danglers I\\'ve ever seen. \\n\\nThe abrupt change from admiring a woman who takes amazing care of her body to these two huge furry tennis balls swaying back and forth apparently broke my mind for a short period of time. I\\'m guessing the woman had seen me jogging a ways behind her as she turned the corner because she moved off into the grass and looked behind her. I imagine to let me pass assuming I was still jogging and not realizing was now walking at the same pace as her. She saw me looking down and I could see her scowl a bit, thinking I was staring at her butt. (which in all fairness I had been moments before.)   \\n\\n\\nHowever, at that moment what she caught me staring at was her dogs obscenely large balls with what was probably a mixture of shock and awe. Her scowl immediately faded and she started laughing so hard she had to stop walking because she almost walked into a street sign. Was at a complete loss of how to respond and was tempted to say I was looking at her butt as if that would somehow help me salvage my dignity. She eventually regained her composure, I blurted out some sort of apology and used the newfound adrenaline to jog most of the way home. But that\\'s not all! Later in the day I ran into her again...as she was entering her apartment....in the same complex as me...  As it turns out she\\'s one of my new neighbors. FML. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\ntl;dr I was going for a jog/walk and ended up behind a beautiful woman who caught me staring at her dog\\'s huge balls. For context, I\\'m on a vacation to Japan and has been staying at my friend\\'s apartment for 3 days. To show a bit of gratitude, I wanted to cook for her so I decided to go for something simple like a Chicken katsu.\\n\\nI\\'ve already marinated the chicken yesterday so the final part is just the batter which is flour, eggs and breadcrumbs. This is the moment I realized that I was out of breadcrumbs so I have to go to the convenience store to get some. I am somewhat decent in Japanese so it should be a smooth trip to the convenience store, right? No.\\n\\nAs I walked in the store, I couldn\\'t find the breadcrumbs I was looking for so I decided to ask the staff there, the conversation goes a bit like this:\\n\\nMe: \"Sumimasen, manko wa doko desu ka?\" which literally translates to \"excuse me, where is da pussy?\"\\n\\nAt this point I didn\\'t realize that I mixed \"manko(pussy)\" and \"panko(breadcrumbs)\". The staff just looks at me, confused, he might be thinking I was trolling and asked me to repeat the question. I repeated the question 3 times, the staff\\'s face switched from being confused to disgusted. After the change of the staff\\'s expression, I realized that I fucked up horribly and felt the embarrassment of a lifetime. I then explained that I mistakenly mixed those 2 words then apologized and thankfully the staff understood me this time.\\n\\nTL;DR I mistaken the word panko(breadcrumbs) for the word manko(pussy) asked a convenience store staff for pussy Today, I (F22) went to a new doctor. It was your standard, run of the mill first doctors appointment that includes a physical and rambling of family health history and any existing conditions. I’m new in town where I am, and have been waiting to see this doctor for about 5 months and made it known I was open for any cancellation appointments that needed to be filled. I had a day off from work today, so when they called to tell me they had an opening in their afternoon schedule, I threw on any clothes that were near me and ran out the door to make this appointment. \\n\\nThis is where my fuck up starts: I have this old pair of panties that have a rip on the side, exposing the right side of my pubic area. They just got ripped before I washed them last and I forgot to throw them out. They subsequently got washed and folded in with my clean underwear in my hamper I’d snatched them from in my hurry. Anyway, I don’t notice and go to the doctors office and get checked in. The doctors nurse informed me I’d have to get naked except for my underwear and into a gown as the doctor does breast exams, whatever no big deal. I’m notorious for being comfortable with my body in doctors offices and locker rooms, so much so that when my mom used to tag along with me to doctors appointments and I was asked to strip down, she’d say “oh, THAT won’t be a problem..” *eye roll* . My logic is, doctors are trained professionals and see bodies all the time, no reason to be ashamed, we all have bodies with their own quirks. \\n\\nMy doctor comes in when I’m undressed and ready in my gown, and things are normal. Kind of awkward, but we push through it. He asks me standard questions and is very thorough with his questioning, which I appreciate. He starts his exam and is listening to my lungs, I do deep breaths, y’all get it. I had mentioned some abdominal pain during his questioning, and he asked my permission to lift my gown and listen in. I oblige and have no issue with this. I lay back, he starts talking to me about something we had in common, and he lifts my gown. He goes silent in the middle of his sentence. I take my eyes off of the weird looking ceiling tile I had been focused on and look at him. His brow is furrowed and he looks at me, kind of befuddled. I, at this point, have no idea what the problem is and say “what were you saying?” in an attempt to brush the awkward moment off. He kind of chuckles and says “hold on, I’ll be right back.” and places my gown back over me. \\n\\nI am oblivious to what’s going on and just lay there breathing heavy due to having my mask on, staring at the weird ceiling tile again when the nurse I’d seen earlier came in. I looked at her and she looked at me and said “heyyyyy, hon.” Which is never a good sign here in the south. “So the doctor sent me in because.. well it looks like your underwear is torn. Did you know that?” Uhhhhhh, no babe I didn’t. I turn beet red, and get so embarrassed and tell her I had no clue, clearly flustered. She kind of laughs it off, says “no worries at all. The doctor wants to make sure you aren’t embarrassed and feel comfortable with him, so he had me tell you. Here’s what we can do: I don’t have any undie options here, but I’ll bring you something you can slip on.” I agree and she leaves the room. I am completely mortified but decide to laugh it off and I can’t help but chuckle to myself when I look down and see what he saw. \\n\\nShe comes back with the aforementioned ‘something to slip on’ and y’all: I walked out of that doctors office with an adult diaper on. My doctor was super kind during the rest of my visit and even had his nurse stay with us in the exam room throughout the rest of the appointment to ensure no tomfoolery on his part which I so appreciated. Although I’m mortified that my doctor saw my no-no square, I walked away with my head held high and the option to pee my pants if I felt like it. \\n\\nTL;DR: wore ripped underwear to my first doctors appointment, exposed myself, and walked away wearing a diaper.\\n\\nEdit: for clarification, the breast exam was toward the end of the physical and the nurse was in the room for it! So quick backstory here, ever since Covid neutered my primary job, I picked up a part-time job as a waiter at a local family joint until things get back to normal (yes I\\'m that optimistic). \\n\\nAnyways, so thanks to a no-show, I ended up taking over for the hostess. The duties are simple for reserving tables, write down the name, number of adults and children, and the estimated wait time. We get about two hours into my shift, and we\\'re rapidly growing our list. I\\'m doing my usual, making small talk, big smiles, \\'how\\'s your day, jeez look at that weather, we\\'ll be ready for you in ten minutes\\' yadda yadda. Then this humble looking father strolls on up, he\\'s polite, and asks for a table for two. I jot down his name with a smile and reply with the sentence that will stay with me until the last molecule of my maggot-ridden corpse finally rots away: \\'And one kids menu, yeah?\\'\\n\\nSuddenly his brow furrows, and he looks like he\\'s ready to tear me apart. Now I\\'m 6\\'2 190lbs, never feel threatened by anyone, but the look on this previously soft humble man\\'s face put the fear of god into me. As I stood there confused, contemplating what I was rapidly assuming could be my last moments on Earth, he leans in close and utters a simple sovereign: **\\'No.\\'**\\n\\nAs my brain rattles around in my skull trying to piece together what he is aggressively objecting to, my peripherals finally decide to do their job and draw my brain\\'s attention to his child.\\n\\nShe\\'s not a child at all, she\\'s his wife, and *she\\'s a dwarf.*\\n\\nShe\\'s refusing to even make eye contact with me, she\\'s just fighting back tears and looking sheepishly away.\\n\\nI can\\'t even.. I\\'m literally just frozen. It\\'s like my entire body was trapped in a factory reset for what seemed like ten solid seconds.\\n\\nOnce I realize how long I\\'ve just been staring at them like a frog, I manage to regain control of my body, and open my mouth to try and formulate some sort of panicked spastic defense, but the pair swiftly turn away and disappear into the crowd like Hannibal Lector at the end of Silence of The Lambs. I\\'m just standing there staring at the spot they once were, suddenly finding the air horrifically thin, as I wait for my eyebrows to return from the back of my head.\\n\\nSo yeah, I definitely ruined this poor woman\\'s night, if not her week, I have no way to rectify my actions, and I am at an utter loss for words.\\n\\ntl;dr- I mistook a dwarf for a child and offered her a kids menu. To make a simple story simple, i was laid off due to Covid killing the industry I worked in. In the past month or so Ive hit a bit of a slump emotionally. \\n\\nI havent reslly done much lately but binge Read Dead Online trying to gring my level up. I dont have social media other than Reddit. And I honestly cant recall seeing any articles about any hurricane. I also dont have cable, just paid services like amazon prime and netflix.\\n\\nFinally, a few hours ago I ran across an article about a hurricane headed for Louisiana. I looked it up on Weather. Com and it now appears I am in the unsurvivable zone of a storm surge. \\n\\nSo not sure what to do at this point.\\n\\nTL:DR- Isolation due to Covid, depression, and video games made me oblivious to the fact that a hurricane was headed directly for me. Now its too late to leave\\n\\nUPDATE: \\n\\n- A friendly redditor dm’d me the location of a gas station that still had gas. This allowed me to gas up while the eye was over Lake Charles and the storm wasnt so bad.\\n\\n- Ive made it 3/4 of my way to Shreveport where I will be staying, out of harms way. The storm is bad but im ahead of it now\\n\\nFrequently asked questions:\\n\\n- My phone battery. I honeslty wasnt without power that long before I left, and I have this cylinder shaped thing that you plug into the wall and charge and then its like a portable charger and you just plug your phone into it, and its like a whole new charge.\\n\\n- Did I really play RDR2 that much? Unfortunately yes. I got lost in finding collectibles and leveled up to 70 in a few days\\n\\n- Was there no emergency text sent out to my\\nIphone? You know I started thinking about this after someone mentioned it, and it seems like my phone did go off at like 11:30pm last night or the night before, but i didnt read it because I thought it was an Amber alert and I was asleep.\\n\\n- Did I get drunk on American Honey? No, i took like one slug off of it before communicating with the gas guy and then I knew i would be leaving soon.\\n\\n- Why did I go back home? After finding no gas, i was too afraid of getting stranded in an unfamiliar place in a storm. I thought mt chances would be better in a place I knew and where I had my things at my disposal.\\n\\nThank you all for the concern, advice, and words of encouragement. Rest and know that I am safe and will be more aware of current events in the future. This is a FU that is three years in the making, culminating today.\\n\\nA few years back I started buying toilet paper on Amazon subscription. But my kid had just moved out so I apparently overestimated how much to buy so it didn\\'t all fit in the linen cupboard. My darling spouse started storing the extra in the garage. But I didn\\'t know this as I never go in there.\\n\\nSo I kept looking in the linen cupboard and seeing we only had a few rolls. And then increasing the subscription. And even buying extra packs one-off because I thought we were out. And spouse kept stashing it all in the garage without me knowing. After almost 2 years of this, he finally begged me to stop buying TP because we were running out of room to store it! So for the past year and a half I have not bought TP at all. As all the coronavirus panic was building I thought, \"well at least my earlier stupidity means we don\\'t have to fight crowds for TP, as I am sure we have enough. We will NEVER run out! We can share with all our friends and neighbors!\"\\n\\nWell, turns out we actually had FINALLY gotten through the huge backlog of TP. And as luck would have it, the first time I genuinely need to buy TP in well over a YEAR, it\\'s this week. FML.\\n\\nI suppose the bright side is I was equally stupid about subscriptions for wipes and paper towels, so I have been able to give those away to needy neighbors.  They all think I am brilliant and prepared. They have no idea it\\'s just because I am dumb.\\n\\nEDIT: to the 60+ people that mentioned I should get a bidet, yes, I agree. Except I do live in a severe drought area. Also, the garage is detached from the house and not where the car goes, and is used for storage only. None of my stuff is in there. Mostly camping stuff and my kid\\'s stuff they didn\\'t take to school. And even if I did go in there, the TP was out of line of sight. So no, I really didn\\'t see the stack for years.  Spouse and I talk plenty, but just not about TP!  ;-) He trusts me to buy stuff and I trust him to put it away when it arrives. We just got too good at our jobs! Plus he\\'s a little bit of a prepper so he didn\\'t think to ask me to stop until we had a LOT, lol!  And for the weirdos who need to know: about 2 rolls per week. Yeah, that\\'s a lot, but there are medical reasons. And lastly, I am amazed how many other people on here have had the exact same type of accidental hoarding experience. And how many ran out at equally inopportune times. I feel better knowing I am not alone. \\n\\nTL;DR: After three years of accidentally having a surplus of TP, I happened to run out entirely THIS week and can\\'t find more to buy. I don\\'t know if Meta threads are allowed, but I think this needs to be said. I believe the removal of the \"NSFW only on weekends\" rule hurt this subreddit a lot. The majority of the posts in the past used to be actually interesting TIFUs that may have been fake, but at least were believable and varied. Nowadays every top post is either getting caught masturbating, getting caught having sex, having sex and causing an injury, masturbating with a weird/disgusting object, or, the best of all, TIFUs that are actually not TIFUs at all and serve only as humble brags - TIFU by missing signs this 10/10 chick was into me, haha what a fool I am...anyways she told me a week later and we had the hottest most amazing sex you can imagine. Sprinkle in as many euphemisms as you can find on google to look unique, and you have >50% posts on this sub.\\n\\nWhen you open many of those stories, you have people actually calling OP out for the story obviously being fake/barely a TIFU (like the guy who almost went down on his cousin and then in an update actually went down on his cousin, like who is actually dumb enough to believe that happened?), so I really doubt I am the only person who thinks the subreddit is regressing.\\n\\nTL;DR: Personally I think the quality of the subreddit would be improved by reinstating the NSFW weekend rule. These post clearly have their audience so I have no problems with them existing at all, and when they were scarce they were indeed actually interesting. However I don\\'t think it\\'s fun to open this sub and seeing the exact same shit every single day. \\n\\n\\nA few years ago I spent a Saturday blissfully tripping by myself. I had dosed that afternoon and I started coming down as the sun was coming up. It was a bright, crisp morning and I felt completely at peace. I was shuffling my music and Sunday Morning by The Velvet Underground came on. It was too perfect and gorgeous to feel cliche and affected.\\n\\nI suddenly made a decision. I had to make some changes. I had to get my fat ass to the gym.\\n\\nI was surprised to see so many people. I had thought, hey, 7am on a Sunday, I\\'ll have the run of the place. I was obviously incorrect. All the cardio machines were taken. I couldn\\'t just stand there. I was already getting sweaty and I\\'d been so high for so long so recently.\\n\\nI saw an empty bench press and went for it. I couldn\\'t remember what I used to bench back in school so I decided to estimate on the low side at around 160. I am 6\\'2 and 250 lbs. I was gonna relax with some leisurely sets and wait for a treadmill to open up.\\n\\nIt was heavier than I imagined. I figured my guns were rusty. I decided to only execute a couple perfect pumpings of weight and then wait for cardio. Suddenly the bar reached the apex of my first attempt and my body gave up with horrifying finality. It was all I could do to keep it balanced while it came down slowly but surely like a hydraulic lift. I let it sit on my chest while I came up with a plan. Every time I tried to move it my arms shook and wobbled like a fawn learning to stand. I decided to slowly rock back and forth until it could roll down my beautiful plus size body. With momentum and gravity it would roll to my thighs and free me. Perfect. I tensed my belly and strained forward with all of my might.\\n\\n*Wwwhhhooooooooooooooooot....*\\n\\nThe bar rolling down toothpasted a fart out. I lacked the strength to tighten my butthole so it just kinda fell out. Sounded like a giant blowing on a bottle. If anyone heard it, they ignored it. Despite my meticulous calculations, the bar had stopped and settled between my belly and groin. It hurt. I slowed my breathing and just relaxed. It\\'ll be ok, I thought. I got this, I prayed.\\n\\n*Brap brap...brap brapbrapbrapbrapbrap*.\\n\\nNope, it\\'s bad, this is bad. Everyone had to have heard the rounds I let fly from the ol semiauto bubblegut. The volume was incredible. No one knew I was literally pinned to the goddamn bench, ashamed and trapped there in my fart. No one laughed. Time was frozen but I assume only a few minutes passed. Finally a very small man ran over, effortlessly grabbed the weights and racked them. He looked up at me with genuine concern.\\n\\n\"Hey man are you alr-\"\\n\\n*popopopopopopop............WHHHOooooooot.*\\n\\nTo his credit he only grinned for a second before regaining control. More like a twitch. I nodded somberly, thanked him and shook his hand. I tried to act like my asshole had not just popped off like a string of firecrackers and finished off with the moan of a dying whale. He left me standing there, trying to plan a graceful exit strategy. Everyone was pretending not to notice me as they stared peripherally and slowed or stopped their exercise. All I wanted was a way to salvage this and look normal. Like I wasn\\'t bothered at all.\\n\\nSo, knowing I was being observed, I did this. I stood tall, nodded to myself like I nailed it, clapped firmly one time and said *Alright*\\n\\n**Fuck.**\\n\\n**Me.**\\n\\nThe door barely whispered shut behind me when the laughter started. I ran to my car.\\n\\nI can now find the humor in my pathetic failed benchpress and uncontrollable farting. There is nothing funny about The Clap. It pops into my head randomly every few months or so and makes my face hot and my stomach cramp.\\xa0I just wanted to look like a normal human being.\\n\\nTL;DR I went to the gym under the influence, publicly displayed how weak I am, became trapped on the bench and farted uncontrollably until I was rescued. Then I pretended I had just done really well and congratulated myself with a lil nod, clap and *Alright* as if I could alter reality by sheer force of will. This happened many years ago! But it still an experience that brings a few laughs. (tl:dr at the bottom)\\n\\nBack in college, I shared a room with a 4’9 dude and he was nice man. He would always leave everything spotless, he was an amazing wingman and he always managed to make sure that when we had a few people over that they’d all have food readily available and drinks etc. He was so cool. Anyway, he told me he was going to have a date and asked if I’d be going to my friends house for the night (he didn’t live too far and I had been talking about meeting him one of the days) I was like “yeah maybe, ohhh I see you want the room tonight I got you don’t worry”. So he’s all nervous about his date and I give him a pep talk I said “you’re a good man, your dates gonna be great and you definitely look ace!” He was all hyped up and left. \\n\\nI called my buddy and asked if he was at home, he was actually at work. But, he told me he’ll be back home within a couple hours or so. Now, my roommate who was on his date told me he would ring or text me to let me know he got back safe to the room and to give me the heads up when to leave. \\n\\nSo, I figured I got plenty of time. I laid on the bed and basically waited for two hours to go by to get a phone call from my buddy to tell me he had finished work. But, I instead get a text message from him saying he had finished work and that he’ll be getting home a lot later than expected. Still no sign from my roommate on his date though (who said he’ll ring/message me if he’s bringing his date back)\\n\\nThen *I ended up falling asleep*\\n\\nAgain after waiting for my buddy to message me when he’s free to meet. After some time passes I begin to wake up a little because I hear some distorted voices, giggling and bed creaking . I’m like “oh fuck” he’s with his date, him and her are gonna be pissed if I ruin their night now by waking up, “Why didn’t he text me or ring?!!”. So, I stayed stationary and pretended to be asleep. I hear them both get outta bed and lay on the floor (I imagine cause of the bed creaking). I then start to hear the almighty thunderous clapping of balls and I’m seriously trying to hold my laughter in _but_ then I I heard moaning like a Japanese anime character.. which confused me. Anyway at this point I’m still trying to hold my laughter in, I realised I had knocked my phone near the edge of the bed because of my inability to keep my composure, so I decided to try and grab it splinter cell lock picking style. I grab the phone without being noticed and in that moment curiosity got the better of me. The ball slamming stopped and it went quiet so I decided then take a slight peak to see if him and his date was asleep and if the coast was clear.. *Nope!* as I opened my eye all I see is a 6’7, huge bald black dude followed by the deepest male voice I’ve ever heard in my entire life say “now say you want more now” and continue the almighty thunderous ball slamming I see my 4’9 roommate getting absolutely destroyed up and down like a goddamn yo yo waving his arms in the sky like when you was a kid and needed a piss but you was in class and you had to raise your hand impatiently to get the teachers attention to go to the bathroom. I again stayed stationary as possible with tears of laughter running down my eyes. All the business stopped and the behemoth of a man left the dorm and my roommate just went straight to bed humming. \\n\\nThe next day I got up early, showered and decided to get McDonalds breakfast for myself and my roommate and a strong coffee (believe me, even I felt exhausted after all of that). I come back to the room to see my roommate watching TV as if nothing happened whatsoever. I said “Well tell me about the date? Was she nice?” Whilst he grinned and ate his Sausage McMuffin. He just looked at me and said “It was so much fun we’re going to meet again very soon”. \\n\\nNow, I didn’t want to say anything because his sexuality is his business and he’ll say when the time was right (he did a month later). So, I said “I’m glad you had a good time”. As I leave the room and make my way down the hallway, what do I see?? The behemoth black dude walking down hallway with the look of a man on a mission, literally like terminator as he walks through the hallway of the psychiatric hospital. I took a last glance through the window while the dude made his way to my room. So, when my friend said “we’re going to meet again _soon_” little did I know it would be less than 10 hours from the other night. But at least this time they had all the privacy they wanted and I didn’t have to almost die of laughter. \\n\\nTL;DR - Roommate went on a date, brought back home his date, didn’t know his date was another dude, I fell asleep and eventually woke up to see him getting destroyed by a dude the size of [Bob Sapp](https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/002/071/282/bobsapp_crop_north.jpg?1357083029&amp;w=630&amp;h=420) who came back less than 10 hours later for round two. And I’m 99% certain he ate my McDonalds Hashbrown that I left on the side.\\n\\n\\nEdit -* _Brought_* in title, I’m tired idc.\\n\\nEdit 2- Holy Shit, plat/gold and silvers thanks you so much\\n\\nEdit 3 - I know my titles suck worse than the Avatar adaption *The Last Airbender* live action movie, forgive me. \\n\\nSome have asked and yeah, me and my Ex Roommate are still friends but we both live on different sides of the planet now. *I was 16 when this happened. Golden age of fuck ups.* \\n\\nI hooked up with one of the girls from my church. We were on opposite ends of the spectrum when it came to religious obligations. I was more of an observer in our church, whereas as she was like fully devoted to serving the Big G. However the two of us shared one common goal. We wanted to fuck. Which we did. But afterwards she was overcome with religious guilt and without warning me went straight to our pastor to confess her \"carnal sins\". She named and shamed both of us. None of this would\\'ve been *that* bad if it wasn\\'t for the fucked up fact that our pastor was also my damn father. \\n\\nSo thanks to that confession, that\\'s how my dad found out his virgin son dipped his doodle in the Deacon\\'s daughter. \\n\\n*Edit: Thank you for the Silver & Gold!* \\n\\n*Edit: Okay, gawd damn. Some of you are sick of all the sex posts. Noted.* \\n\\n*Edit: A few of you are asking how my old man reacted. Every second or third weekend he dragged my ass to prison, where he would occasionally preach the word of God. Being there scared the shit out of me and he knew that. I was forced to listen to \"rehabilitated\" rapists and murderers read scriptures out of the Bible and give me lessons on what it meant to be born again and to live a pure life in Christ... free from temptation, sin, all the shit 16 year old me was guilty of that time. I never had sex with the Deacon\\'s daughter ever again.*\\n\\n**TL:DR Made ungodly love to a Christian girl. She went crazy with guilt and confessed all our filthy fornicating to the pastor of our church. Aka my dad.** I\\'m going to preface this TIFU by saying, no, this didn\\'t actually happen today. It has taken me some time to heal and see the humor in it.\\n\\nIt was our first Valentine\\'s Day together this year. I woke up super horny and reached over for him, and noticed he was extremely ready to go as well.\\n\\nI decided what better way to start off the holiday than to begin with loud, hot morning sex. It was incredible, and after we came together, we collapsed in bed. \\n\\nI needed some post-orgasmic cuddles and turned...\\n\\nThis is when things begin to go wrong.\\n\\nAll of the sudden, he started trying to motion to me. I glanced up at him and realized he was seconds away from a seizure. (He has epilepsy, and has advised me how to care for him)\\n\\n\\nSure enough, he began to violently seize. I go full protective mode and try to help him. He was lying on his back and started to choke on his saliva.\\n\\nWe\\'re both still naked and I have gone from a concerned collected and supportive gf to an adrenaline fueled mama bear in full on freak out mode. \\n\\nFight or flight kicks in and I know I must get him on to his side to prevent asphixiation. I\\'m on the smaller side, being 5\\'6 and around 125lbs. So when my actively seizing bf (6\\'2 190lbs) needs to be moved, I go balls to the walls.\\n\\nI grabbed his arm and pull with all my weight and everything in me and heard a disgusting\\n\\n*CLACK*\\n\\n\\nOnce he\\'s back to and able to talk, he moans, saying that his arm is killing him, and that he thinks it\\'s dislocated. I drive him to the hospital\\nAnd sure enough his shoulder is severely dislocated. I apologized profusely to my man, who responded\\n\\n\"Babe you fucked me into a seizure..I\\'m pretty sure you cannot top something like that.\"\\nSo not only, on our FIRST Valentine\\'s Day together did I literally fuck him into a seizure, but I also dislocated his shoulder. \\n\\nTLDR: Had sex with boyfriend that had a seizure afterwards, tried to turn him on his side and dislocated his shoulder in the processs. So we live in a fairly small upper flat and have two kids. It was about 1 a.m. both kids had been asleep for the night and my wife and I got started hiding Easter Eggs and baskets. When all this was finished up, I started feeling a bit frisky, but one of the kids was asleep on our bed. So we decieded to have a quicky right on the living room floor. At some point during the act, I look up at our hallway and there is my seven year old daughter, groggy and just staring at us. My wife and I both disconnected covered up with blankets and started laughing. I instantly just blurted out to my daughter \"we just woke up too, looks like the Easter Bunny has been here better get back to bed!\" My daughter sleep walks a lot, and never remembers anything about waking up in the middle of the night, so I was sure she had no clue what just happened. Well, we\\'re video chatting with my mom this morning and she asked my daughter if she got to bed on time (or else the bunny doesn\\'t show up I guess) and if she slept okay. Her response \" Yeah, but he took Mom and Dad\\'s clothes off for sleeping in the living room. Such a mischievous little guy!\" My mom died of laughter, our faces turned red, and now we have an Easter Memory that will take my daughter a few years to fully realize.\\n\\nTL;DR My wife and I had a quickie, after hiding Easter Eggs, our daughter caught us and thought the Easter Bunny had removed our clothes for sleeping in the living room. She even told my mother about it! I\\'m a shy person and a reserved person. I don\\'t do stupid shit and I\\'d rather blend in the background. The only person I feel\\xa0comfortable\\xa0goofing around with is my boyfriend.\\n\\nWe were having a perfectly nice summer day today. We went on a walk, did some necessary grocery shopping and started leaving home. Before going I needed to use the\\xa0bathroom, no big deal. My boyfriend will just wait for me outside.\\n\\nMy boyfriend told me he\\'d wait for me by the car. I leave the store the sun in shining and I\\xa0don\\'t\\xa0have my sunglasses but I can see him standing close to our car with his back facing me. I decide to surprise him with a really firm grab on the ass, making sure he could feel my enthusiasm through the grope while\\xa0seductively\\xa0whispering \"nice ass\"\\xa0finished\\xa0by a dumb overexaggerate\\xa0moan. Fucking hilarious, great move on my part.\\xa0\\n\\nThen I hear a loud \"What the fuck\" in an unfamiliar voice and my boyfriend turns\\xa0around\\xa0and well.. it isn\\'t him. It\\'s a much older man wearing all black like my boyfriend. That wiped away the stupid grin on my face real fast. I\\'m completely speechless. I don\\'t know what to say. I just stare at this poor man\\xa0whose\\xa0ass I violated.\\xa0\\n\\nI could feel my face turning red and I start apologizing\\xa0profusely\\xa0while trying to explain the situation in a panic. A little further away by our car I can see my boyfriend walking towards me almost tripping for laughing so much. After what felt like forever the man also bursts out\\xa0laughing\\xa0saying it\\'s fine that I\\'m glad I liked his ass.\\xa0\\n\\nI couldn\\'t laugh even if I wanted to. I\\xa0was horrified. I still am. My boyfriend thinks this is all too funny not to share but I\\'m going to stay\\xa0anonymous\\xa0doing so.\\n\\nIf the man\\xa0whose ass\\xa0I grabbed happens to see this I am so sorry. Just know that a part of me died today and this gave me another reason to never leave my house again. Social distansing no longer feels difficult in any way.\\n\\nTLDR: \\xa0I went to surprise who I thought was my\\xa0boyfriend\\xa0with a firm ass grabbing followed by a moan only to find out he wasn\\'t my boyfriend. I\\'m now dying from\\xa0embarrassment\\n\\nEdit: Wow thank you everyone for sharing your funny stories keep them coming, me and my boyfriend are having a blast reading all of them! I\\'m glad that I\\'m not the only ass grabber around It\\'s really helping me with the embarrassment.\\n\\nEdit: wow this blew up thank you for all the nice comments and the awards. I\\'m able to laugh at it now thanks to all of your stories so thank you. I truly felt horrible and\\xa0embarrassed\\xa0for what happened and yes the situation could have been worse if the genders\\xa0were reversed\\xa0or if the\\xa0recipient\\xa0of this mistake didn\\'t take it so lightly. Thank you for everyone who can see when people make an\\xa0actual\\xa0mistake and can distinguish that from an actually vile act. I shared this because the man didn\\'t take it seriously and laughed with my boyfriend about the accident and no harm\\xa0was done\\xa0apart from the shame I felt. And yes rBangerz YT you can use this story for your video, thanks for asking me beforehand I appreciate that. This just happened to me 10 minutes ago.\\nSo, I was making Instant ramen, as college students tend to do. And then I thought to myself \"business has been good lately, I can afford to treat myself\", so I figured I would indulge by adding the most precious of treats to my broth: a hard boiled egg.\\n\\nSo I looked up on the Internet if you could hard boil an egg in the microwave. And, as luck would half it, I found a very easy to follow article with instructions on how to do it. I was filled with glee.\\n\\nSo, popping the egg in some water and in the microwave, I put the timer to 8 minutes, following the instructions to a T. 3 minutes of me salivating for the fruit of my labor, a loud bang ravaged me from my thoughts.\\n\\nIndeed, the egg had exploded, filling my whole microwave with bloody egg gore. Dumbstruck I checked the article for the source of my mistakes, and that’s when I noticed the article is from April first, 2014.\\n\\nWell played, internet food journal. I’m gonna clean the microwave now.\\n\\nTL;DR check the date of articles if you don’t want your kitchen to get nuked\\n\\nEdit: wow this blew up! Disclaimer for everyone blasting my ass about this, I was high as shit when that happened.\\n\\nEdit: Also my girlfriend was involved in the cooking of the egg, just so you folks know! Still processing this one since it took place about five hours ago. Me (45M) and my wife (47F) have been married for about 5 years and have a combined family. Most of our kids are half time with us and half time with their other parents. Anyway, my 20yo step-daughter\\'s room is just down the hall from the Master Bedroom. About 6 weeks ago, she started sleep walking and wakes standing in random places, she even woke up in the kennel with our dog once (yes I know it\\'s super strange).\\n\\nBecause my wife and I are trying not to scar the kids, we wait until they are all asleep before we have sexy times. Many times this means we go to sleep and then wake each other up in the middle of the night for sexy time. Last night was one of those nights. When we went to bed (between 8 and 9 because we get up at 4am to workout) kids were still up and milling around, so we figured we\\'d wait until the middle of the night or have a quicky before we went to the gym.\\n\\nA few hours later I wake to a stiffy pressed up against my wife\\'s backside and decide it\\'s game time. Within a couple of minutes we are deeply into it and a few minutes later we know it\\'s about time for the grand finale. My wife breathlessly tells me the words that every man around the planet loves to hear \"I want to finish you with my mouth\". I practically jumped off the bed and stand there as my wife gets on her knees to give me a toe curling BJ.\\n\\nI am going to interrupt this story for a moment to give another little factoid. My wife was a single mom to four girls for many years prior to meeting and then marrying me. Her and her daughters are pretty immodest around the house. I\\'m constantly asking them to put shorts or sweats on.\\n\\nAnyway, there I am standing naked beside my bed. My wife is on her knees sucking my soul out through my dick. My eyes are closed my head is back and I\\'m just about to release when I get that weird feeling that I\\'m being watched. I open my eyes and see my 20yo step daughter standing three feet behind her mom in a tank top and panties. I reflexively pulled back from my wife\\'s mouth which caused her to grab extra hard the next thing I know I\\'m spraying my load all over her face while I\\'m looking directly into my step-daughter\\'s eyes. My wife is trying to be playful and thinks I\\'m just feeling kinky and I was just trying to cover myself. My step-daughter just stands there for what seemed like an eternity before saying \"holy shit\" over and over and walking out of our room and back to hers. Of course as soon as my wife heard her daughter\\'s voice she became much less playful and everything got deadly serious.\\n\\nSo now I\\'ve gone to the gym, am sitting at my desk working and my wife has been in talking with her daughter for the past couple of hours. Honestly my only fuckup was the timing. But it did happen today, so there is that.\\n\\nTL;DR My wife and I had middle of the night sexy time, sleep walking step-daughter walked into the room and watched me frost my wife like a cake.\\n\\nFollow Up: They are done talking came out of the room laughing and stuff so I guess no harm no foul. My wife said the three of us should sit down later and talk about the what happened and that her daughter has some questions.\\n\\nEdit: To all those wondering why I added the part about how my step-daughters dress. At the time I was worried that my wife was going to be thinking I was a freak for nutting as soon as I saw her daughter in her panties. That didn\\'t happen at all, when I mentioned it to my wife she waved it off. If I were to write this post now I would leave it out, but it was important to my mindset at the time.\\n\\nEdit: People are claiming that it\\'s been deleted, but I still see it and haven\\'t tried to delete it. Any how, I just tagged it as NSFW (something I should have done in the beginning, but I didn\\'t know) maybe that fixes things. I\\'m enjoying some of you funny sick people.\\n\\nEdit: Well we just had an hour plus conversation. My step-daughter was just wanting to clear the air (she was a lot more mature about it than I thought she would be). She asked a couple of questions about how often is normal and stuff like that. I don\\'t want to get too specific, but all of her questions centered around how far my wife and I pushed each other\\'s boundaries sexually. We were open and honest with her about it. Turns out she is not a virgin (I am actually surprised) and the first guy she was with was very pushy. The guy she\\'s with now is very laid back, but maybe too laid back. We told her to be vocal with him about what she wants. I think she understands, but my wife is going to follow up on the conversation later.\\n\\nBTW, she did not even realize what was going on at first. All she saw was that I was standing there naked. It was when I saw her and started to freak out that she understood what was going on.. My wife and I have already stripped the bed and are washing the sheets and comforter. I am shampooing the carpet this afternoon and there are spots on the wall that need to be washed. My wife found some of my material in her hair... at work she sent me [this pic](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-xLxBjV-kW_8/UI2KgL4_O_I/AAAAAAAAG8U/yMWE-6BXi8I/s1600/Cameron-Diaz-There\\'s-Something-About-Mary-Ejaculate-Hair-Gel.jpeg).\\n\\nI got back on here and this post is at almost 10k and my inbox is screaming for mercy. I\\'ll try to answer as many questions as possible.\\n\\nOK, I\\'m disabling inbox replies. I can\\'t believe that my (by far) most upvoted post is about my wife and I nearly emotionally scaring my step-daughter. Be well everybody. Today my sister started a video call class for school while I was sleeping. We share a room and her camera was pointing at the area between my bed and the wardrobe (angled to give a perfect view of the floor, as I learned). I was in only a bra and shorts and needed to get dressed. Naturally, I decided that the most sensible was to crawl underneath the range of her camera. Halfway across the room, I realized that I was visible to her entire class and *froze*, crouching in front of her class half-naked like Gollum. As one does when they find themselves in an embarrassing situation, I tried to pass it off as intentional by hissing \"My preciousssssss\" and scuttling away. \\n\\nTl;dr: Crawled half-naked in front of video call, tried to make it less weird by pretending to be Gollum. Alright so let’s start this with a little context because right off the bat reading the title you’ll be like wtf? \\n\\nSo my wife and 3 year old daughter play tag pretty much on a daily.  And more accurately it’s more of a chase me chase me game, my daughter never chases back when caught. Anyways, the game usually starts by my daughter telling my wife “Mommy, get my booty! Get my booty mom” and off to the races they go. \\n\\nObviously this is a game that both parents play and she’ll also usually request that we be a dinosaur, monster, tiger, etc. This get my booty thing is also something she says at daycare now when playing with friends but luckily everyone thinks it’s cute and we haven’t gotten any feedback on it.\\n\\nThis brings us to last night. The wife is upstairs with our little boy giving him a bath when my daughter jumps on the couch, puts her butt right next to my face and yells “GET MY BOOTY DADDY!” To which I reply nonchalantly “I’m going to eat your booty! Nom nom nom” since her butt was right next to my face. \\n\\nI immediately regret it because she jumps off the couch and starts yelling “EAT MY BOOTY DADDY! EAT MY BOOTY” and takes off running. Dear lord, what have I done?! I try to go into damage control and revert back to Get your booty, but it’s too late, eat my booty is the new tag. \\n\\nI took her to daycare this morning, I hope she forgot all about it. I’m dreading picking her up.\\n\\nTL;DR my daughter yells Get my booty to initiate games of tag. With her jumping on the couch and shaking her butt right next to my face I instead say I’m going to eat your booty! She now yells EAT MY BOOTY to initiate the game instead. \\n\\nEdit: A word. Also thanks for the gold kind stranger!\\n\\nThere were lots of requests for an update after pickup. All is well, even played the chase me game at daycare while picking her up. \\n\\nThanks to everyone that shared their own stories, they were hilarious and me and the wife really enjoyed them. \\n\\nFor those that got offended, sorry? None of it was intended and i thought it was a funny anecdote to share. Cheers! Me and my girlfriend were out on a walk yesterday enjoying the Finnish autumn. We decided to go to a local\\xa0bakery before heading home. The bakery sells great hot chocolate and other treats. We got in and ordered two hot chocolates.\\n\\nMy girlfriend is lactose intolerant so having milk makes her feel sick but she is able to enjoy it with no problems if she has lactase enzyme capsules before eating anything with milk in it.\\n\\nThe\\xa0bakery\\xa0was empty apart from us and an older\\xa0lady\\xa0sitting a few tables from us. As we were waiting for our order my girlfriend had to use the restroom so she left for a while. Our drinks arrived in the meanwhile.\\n\\nMy girlfriend uses lactase enzyme capsules that\\xa0can be\\xa0opened and sprinkled on top of\\xa0the food/drink before eating it or consumed as is. My girlfriend finds that opening them and adding them straight to food works best for her.\\n\\nI was carrying her stuff in my pockets so I decided to mix the lactase enzyme in her drink before she came back so it could take its time to dissolve properly. I opened the pill, poured the stuff inside her hot chocolate and mixed it in and didn\\'t think much of it.\\n\\nThe\\xa0lady\\xa0left and I was sitting there alone now. My girlfriend was taking a while and I started wondering if everything was fine. A while later my girlfriend, looking like she was holding in laughter, came back to the table with the old\\xa0lady. The\\xa0lady\\xa0looked at me with a stern\\xa0panicked\\xa0look on her face and asked me what I put in my girlfriends drink. I\\xa0was confused\\xa0and it took me a while to process the question.\\xa0\\n\\nThen I realized how suspicious I must have looked. A guy out with a girl, taking a pill from his pocket and mixing\\xa0the content of\\xa0it in her drink while she is using the bathroom. And that\\'s exactly what the\\xa0lady\\xa0sitting a few tables from us saw.\\n\\nI\\'m an anxious man so I panicked and\\xa0frantically\\xa0started explaining everything to the\\xa0lady\\xa0showing the package for the pills and everything. My girlfriend confirmed what I was saying but the\\xa0lady\\xa0was still having a hard time believing it. She had called the cops so we had to wait for them to show up and explain the situation to them. I felt extremely awkward and\\xa0embarrassed. The old\\xa0lady\\xa0was in a bit of a shock but eventually she believed everything was okay and left.\\n\\nIn the end we were able to laugh about the situation. I\\'m really glad that the\\xa0lady\\xa0actually took action and I did thank her for trying to help in a situation like that. It\\'s good to know that people look after each other.\\n\\nTldr; I ordered hot chocolates with my girlfriend at a\\xa0bakery. She went to the bathroom and I put a lactase enzyme pill in her drink making an old\\xa0lady\\xa0think I was\\xa0roofying\\xa0her. She called the cops\\n\\nEdit: Some people are confused about why the lady didn\\'t stop when I explained what the pills where. She hadn\\'t heard about those things before and she was scared and confused since she thought a crime was happening right infront of her. She just wanted to make sure my girlfriend was okay, so it took some time to convince her it was all fine. It wasn\\'t entitlement or anger it was confusion. She just wanted to make sure my girlfriend was okay and that I wasn\\'t lying, the old lady was very kind. And she called the police before talking with my girlfriend A few days ago was the first time in a while that I left my house. As in at least a month and a half. \\n\\n\\nI went to stock up on groceries, and as I left my house, and got on a bus\\n(you don’t need a mask on them where I live)\\n\\nI realised I forgot my mask. \\n\\n\\nI got off and walked home because I’m not about getting the rona. \\n\\nAs I arrived at my house, I reached for my keys. Nope. There was nothing in my pockets. \\n\\nI retraced my steps, thinking I must have dropped them on the sidewalk. Nope. I then realised that they must be on the bus. I think they must have fallen out of my pocket when I left the bus in such a hurry.\\n\\nThat’s when it struck me, I probably should call a locksmith. ( I have a spare set in my house) so I go home to connect to my WiFi. I reached into my pocket, and then I realised I left it on charge...\\n\\nSo my big brain does some really smart thinking, and I decide to break in, to my own house...\\n\\nI tried climbing on to my balcony, because I thought I left the window unlocked.\\n\\nSo there I am, looking like a ninja climbing on to my balcony. I thought I finessed it and I could get in easy, but that’s where my little hope broke through. \\n\\nI heard a siren, looked down and saw a police car. I then realised how bad I looked. \\n\\nI explained what happened, and they looked really confused. I showed them some ID and showed them it was my house. \\n\\nThat is the story of how I nearly got arrested.\\n\\nTL;DR I forgot my mask, which led to me losing my keys, which led to me nearly being arrested for breaking and entering, into my own house. So this actually happened about a week and a half ago. Some pre knowledge. I dated my next door neighbor for about a year and a half, but then we eventually broke up. So the other day I was really hungry and wanted some Panda Express Orange chicken. I texted my friend to see if he wanted to go get some panda with me and he replied sure but that he wanted to drive because he had gotten a new car and wanted to surprise me with it. I was like “alright sounds good brother see you in a bit”. \\nA couple minutes later a car rolls up in front of my house. So naturally I got went out and got in thinking that it was my friend. I got in and buckled and was ready to go when the driver looked over and said, “ummm you’re not my girlfriend,” quickly I looked up and realized “oh god I am in my ex girlfriends new boyfriends car. I started to unbuckle and get out. I opened the door and heard a thunk. Now I’m thinking to myself “oh god I just hit the door against the curb but when I looked up it turns out I actually hit my ex with the door. Quickly I apologized and got out and waited for my friend inside my house. \\n\\nTL;DR I got in my ex girlfriends new boyfriends car thinking that it was my friend. Then when I got out I hit her with the door. This happened many years ago, but is one of my favorite stories. \\n\\nWhen I was 17, I went to Ireland with my parents. We were there over my birthday, and I decided I wanted to get my nose pierced to celebrate. My mom and dad asked the hotel concierge where we could get it done, they recommended a place, and off we went.\\n\\nAs soon as we walked in the door, we realized it was a sex shop. We were surrounded by hardcore fetish gear, toys, and porno dvds. But a worker greeted us brightly and confirmed that they indeed did piercings in the back. \\n\\nMy parents were permissive and liberal when I was a kid, so they just kind of shrugged, giggled with me, and let the guy lead us through to the back. A heavily tattooed, outrageously attractive woman pierced my nose, and although I did not yet know I was a lesbian, I was certainly *interested* in the way she apologized for the pain by saying, “Sorry sugar!” in her lovely Irish accent. \\n\\nPiercing complete and a bit woozy, I walked back into the sex shop to find my parents, and spotted my dad standing in front of a wall of dildos.  \\n\\n“Checking out the dildos?” I joked, but to my dismay the man who turned to face me was not, in fact, my father. \\n\\nThis poor random Irish guy took a look at me and said uncomfortably, “I’m just looking around.” Keep in mind that although I was 17, I am 4’ 11” and looked about 12, so from this man’s perspective an actual child had just interrupted his sex toy browsing to question him about his behavior. \\n\\nMortified, I threw up my hands and said what came to mind first, the most situationally absurd sentence of my life, “Oh my god, I’m so sorry—I thought you were my father!”\\n\\nAs the man’s face contorted in horror, the implication of what I had just said hit me, and I fled. I found my parents and shooed them out of the store. I told them what had just happened and they laughed all the way back to the hotel. \\n\\nTl;dr My parents accidentally took me to a sex shop to get my nose pierced, I jokingly asked a man I thought was my father about browsing dildos, the man was not my father and I apologized by implying that my father and I were shopping for sex toys together.\\n\\nEdit: Wow, thanks for all the awards! I’m glad this silly story made y’all laugh. My girlfriend and I have been together for about a year and a half. She is into butt stuff which is fine with me for the most part, but I’ve always told myself that I would never eat ass. I just think it’s unsanitary and just gross. But she’s dropped hints here and there that she would like me to do it, but I’ve always deflected it. I decided I might finally give it a try, maybe it won’t be so bad. If it’s something she would really enjoy it, why not? But then a concerning thought entered my head.\\n\\nI have a peanut allergy and my girlfriend LOVES paydays, the peanut candy bars. There is a vending machine at her work and has one most days during her lunch break. I wasn’t sure if it would be safe to eat her ass due to my allergy and her diet. So I decided to ask reddit.\\n\\nMost of the replies said that it shouldn’t be anything to worry about, so what the hell, let’s go for it.\\n\\nShe gets off work and we start doing our thing and it comes time to toss the ol salad. It wasn’t quite as bad as I thought it was going to be considering she keeps herself pretty clean. But after a few minutes, my throat started to get itchy and I could tell that my eyes were swelling up.\\n\\nI pulled my face out from between her pooper cheeks and told her I’d be right back and ran to the bathroom. This obviously made her very self conscience. I was in the bathroom watching my face swell up for 5 minutes or so and when I came back I looked like Will Smith from Hitched when he eats the seafood. \\n\\nI had to explain to her that I was going to be fine (my peanut allergy is not life threatening or anything too serious) but it was a pretty awkward situation. She told me I didn’t ever have to do it again, so I guess there’s a silver lining to the story.\\n\\nTLDR: I have a peanut allergy, and ate my girlfriends ass after she had a payday candy bar, causing my entire face to swell up.\\n\\n\\nSide note: received advice from r/nostupidquestions for those wondering. Background:\\n\\n1. I’m a shower gal. The last time I took a bath was when I was sick, YEARS ago.\\n2. I am a teacher under copious amounts of stress from this lovely school year\\n\\nThe FU:\\n\\nToday after a particularly stressful day teaching, I decided I needed to do some self care. I went to ulta and was browsing and I stumbled upon the bath bomb section. In my head I thought “why not?? Baths can’t be that bad, I always see people in movies relaxing in a bath. Let’s give it a try!” I carefully selected a pink bath bomb, and that dear reader is key to my fu.\\n\\nWhen I got home I decided to make a night out of it. I got my book, poured myself a glass of wine, put  on a bubbling face mask, and I turned on some tunes. I was sitting in the tub and I dropped in the bath bomb. It was pretty! And smelled great! In order to soak in the ~relaxation vibes~ I leaned back and gracefully, with my gangly ass elbows flailing about for balance, knocked the wine glass into the tub and the glass shattered instantly.\\n\\nSo there I was, in a tub with pink water, broken glass floating EVERYWHERE, and bubbles all over my face from the face mask. I tried to wipe my eyes to see but instead rubbed the bubbles in my eyes. I called for my boyfriend who runs in and sees me crying from the soap, surrounded by glass and “bloody” pink water. He then sees the 3 inch long shard of glass JUTTING out of my back. After a mini freak out on his part, he fished out all the glass, yanked that sucker out of my back, and had to flush out my eyes because by that point they were burning and I was hysterical. 0/10 would NOT recommend taking a bath to de-stress.\\n\\n\\nTL:DR baths are overrated unless you are a graceful swan who can control their appendages.\\n\\nEdit: a lot of people keep saying that glass doesn’t float so this is fake, I used the wrong word guys! I didn’t mean like floating on the top, but rather mixing in with the water/flowing around any time I moved? My movement stirred it around. Sorry for the confusion! So lets start off with the fact that my dad has messed up teeth and didn\\'t want his son to have bad teeth, so they paid a good sum of money to get them fixed.\\n\\nI had 11 years of orthodontic work starting with a gum graft when I was 5.\\n\\nWe\\'ll come back to this later.\\n\\nWhen I was growing up and even in early adulthood I could hardly breathe. I would sleep in a sitting position when I got sick, and when I wasn\\'t sick my nose was always clogged and my tonsils were the size of golf balls.\\n\\nI never really complained that I couldn\\'t breathe with my mouth closed because I assumed that it was normal somehow.\\n\\nEventually when I was 24 I went to an ENT specialist to get it checked out because one more night of sitting upright unable to sleep because I couldn\\'t breathe was too much.\\n\\nI went to this German doctor who checked me out and he was very confused how I had lived so long with such a horrible airway. At this point I was about 270lbs and just shy of 5\\'11. Physical exercise wasn\\'t my forte.\\n\\nHe asked me if I had ever broken my nose and to my knowledge I never have. He was confused by this so he sent me for some x-rays. Before I left he told me that I likely need a structural rhinoplasty, and I probably also needed my tonsils out.\\n\\nThe x-ray comes back and he tells me that it makes no sense. I\\'m not a doctor but when the specialist says your bones are wrong, you get a bit concerned so I went back in.\\n\\nHe showed me on the x-ray that my jaw was not a straight line, there are sections in it that go up in levels as if I had a ton of work done on my teeth and that the work likely messed up my nose so bad that it wasn\\'t functional.\\n\\nHe asked me what orthodontic work I had and all clicked for him when I gave him the laundry list of work that they had done. I told him I had gum grafts, headgear, braces, tongue cages, spacers, retainers, and they wanted to break my jaw and move it forward but after 11 years of this I decided enough was enough. I wont have my jaw broken in the name of good teeth.\\n\\nThe doctor told me to roll back to the spacers. I explained it was a device they installed in my mouth that opened my pallet from a V shape to a U shape and he said that\\'s what did it.\\n\\nWhen the orthodontist increased the size of my upper jaw it pulled my nose over to the right side of my face permanently blocking that nostril and partially blocking the other.\\n\\nI had this done when I was 7 years old and coincidentally that\\'s also the time that I turned into a walrus of a young boy.\\n\\nSo long story short they gave me a structural nose job, removed my tonsils and adenoids and I lost 80 pounds in 6 months and had a lot more energy. I could sleep laying down even when I was sick and even can kind of breathe with my mouth closed.\\n\\nSo to the German guy who fixed my face, thank you. I would not have lived as good of life if it wasn\\'t for your work.\\n\\nAnd to the orthodontist... thank you for fixing my teeth even though it cost me 14 years of health.\\n\\nTL;DR Orthodontists fucked up my nose, I didn\\'t understand the problem completely for 14 years.\\n\\nEdit: Wow the amount of people responding that they have similar issues is massive. If you do a class action holla at your boy. I went to Walmart to pick up some stuff.  First item on my list: bottle of the ol’ faithful KY Jelly.   \\n\\nI walked into the pharmacy section to find all of that “paraphernalia” is now locked in a glass box.  I stood there in disbelief.  I have to ASK for access to slip-n-slide now?!  Am I 14 again? Seriously?!\\n\\nI was about to walk off,  not wanting to ASK a stranger to unlock the box.  I mean, vegetable oil is cheaper anyway right? \\n\\nBut then a female employee just happened to walk by and ask if I needed the box opened.  I sheepishly nodded my head yes, trying not to make any noise that would attract unwanted attention from the 20 people in the pharmacy line. \\n\\nSo out of her pocket comes the loudest keychain full of keys I’ve ever heard.  People in the toy section turned to see what the noise was and then made their kids look away.  Everyone in pharmacy turned and looked at me like “oh Karen, look at that fat creepy guy who is too good to buy Jergens like normal people.”\\n\\nSo as she’s unlocking the box, she bangs those keys all over the glass, making even more noise as she opens the door.  \\n\\nIn haste to get out of the situation as fast as possible, I reach in and grab my preferred sex jelly product and turned to leave — she yells at me — with everyone watching —  “EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME, I HAVE TO CARRY THAT TO THE FRONT FOR YOU.”\\n\\nSeriously?  Please tell me no.  Shampoo is starting to feel like a reasonable option at this point.  \\n\\nSo she grabs it out of my hand and starts walking.  \\n\\nI won’t have to shake the bottle, because this very energetic woman, 4 foot 11 fireball,  is dramatically waving hello at EVERY SINGLE fellow employee with my tug goo in her hand.  Meanwhile, I try to invisibility walk 5 paces behind her.   \\n\\nOnce my creep-walk journey was finally at the front of the store, this woman led me past all the other customers, and hands the jerk jelly to the manager on duty, pointed at me and said in the loudest socially acceptable voice for someone watching a playoff football game: “THIS is for THIS man!”  And pointed at me.  \\n\\nThe Manager on duty, yet another woman in my life that silently judges me, started walking without making eye contact, and says “come this way”.  \\n\\nWell, I had planned to do that.  But after this public Walmart humiliation, I’m not sure I can muster the concentration to make this purchase necessary. \\n\\nWe made our way to self checkout as she held the bottle with two fingers in an outstretched arm like a dirty diaper.  \\n\\nThat’s when I realized — with all the unbelievable embarrassing display of following the hand-waver to the front — I didn’t get anything else on my list.  My hand basket was completely empty.  So my entire purchase was KY Jelly.  The lady looked at me and said “Is this all you needed?”\\n\\n“Well, yes, because I left my dignity back in pharmacy.”\\n\\nAnd THAT is the story of my last Walmart purchase ever.\\n\\nTL;DR I tried to buy KY at Walmart, but their new anti-theft policy requires dramatic public humiliation and shaming when buying any sex-related products, leading me to never shop at Walmart ever again.\\n\\n\\n———————\\nFinal update:\\n\\nThank you for the kind reddit gifts.  They were my first ever.  I’m happy you enjoyed it.  It was embarrassing then, but it’s funny now, glad you agree. Well, well, well.  This just happened this past weekend\\n\\nI hate the word horny but I am that x 1000000 right now and was sexting with a friend and it was getting pretty graphic.  I sent her a bunch of vids and she was so impressed by my seductive stripper skills that she asked if I could surprise her friends by posing as the Uber Eats guy and stripping for them.  Fuck yeah!  I’ve always fantasized about this, i’m an exhibitionist, what a dream.  We decide I’ll deliver the food, and she’ll make a joke like how much to take it all off...\\n\\nWe set up the plan, the time, etc and I go and pick up the food and come to deliver it.  I’m wearing a man thong under my jeans, i’m freshly groomed, I’m rock fucking hard and I’m nervous but excited.  I give myself a little fluff in the hallway and knock on the door.... which is answered by MY EX.  Like, not a kind of dated ex, but like lived with.  She is apparently friends of my friends friend (that makes sense, I read it back).  I’ve always held a good job, and she looks at me with so much sympathy. Like shocked my life has come to this.  She asks why I’m doing Uber Eats and I just say l need the extra money and she is like “that’s so sad do you want to come in”\\n\\nI hesitate, but come in and see my sexting friend. She’s drunk and says “heyyyyy uber eats,  how much to show me that cock!”  Her friends laugh, but my ex is like, “chill, this is my ex.  i feel so bad he’s delivering food!” or something along those lines.  Me and sexting girl share a weird look, she is confused as fuck.  I say I have to go, and race out of there.  Holy fuck.\\n\\ntl:dr went to strip for my friend, didn’t realize my ex would be there, and she thought i was at a very low point\\n\\n\\nedit:  wow didn’t expect this to blow up!\\n- no the photos in my post history are not what i sent to sexting girl.  what i sent to her was much more..... graphic?  lol\\n- yes i have had sex with sexting girl.  we met on tinder and our relationship has been 10000% sexual\\n- no i have never stripped before\\n- no sexting girl didn’t say anything to my ex.  we talked after and she’s just bummed that i didn’t whip my cock out in front of them all.  she said she would have made my ex realize what she lost lol.\\n\\nedit 2: more answers to more questions!\\n- as i said the photos/videos i sent to texting girl were more graphic.  i’ll just say that she’s really into butt stuff.  and she really likes it when I wear her panties.  I’ll leave it at that\\n\\n- nothing wrong with uber eats, and surprised it’s so well paying!  i have just had a “career” type job since college, so seeing this change of path seemed like I had fallen on hard times to my ex i’m guessing, understandably \\n\\n- no i don’t have an onlyfans lol.  but feel free to dm me i’m happy to share So, I work the register at a big grocery store. I like to chat, makes the day go faster. I see that the elderly woman has several big bags of green marshmallows and I comment on the nice mint smell coming from them, which I could smell through the mask. She was worried, because she hadn\\'t thought they were mint. They were for her grandchildren. I just told her that I would check the ingredients. Nope, no mint. Turned out to be the chocolate mint candy UNDER the bags. I did comment on the fact that it had tilapia in it, though. She had no clue what that was, and was absolutely horrified to hear that her marshmallows contained fish. I just offhandedly told her that it was probably just a new alternative to the pig\\'s feet they normally use. If anything, she turned greener. She had no idea where gelatin comes from. She still did buy the marshmallows, but was in shock and horror at the idea of what she was feeding the kids.\\n\\nTLDR: I horrified an old woman by telling her that marshmallows are made of pigs feet and fish. Ruined them for her for life.\\n\\nEdit: OMG, thank you everyone for the awards! I didn\\'t expect this response!\\n\\n Edit: Front page?! Never happened to me before! I seriously thought this would just kind of disappear like most of my posts. I was running a bit late for a long-haul flight from Delhi to London, so I quickly bought some snacks and shoved them in my travel bag as I ran to the boarding gate.\\n\\nAbout 4 hours in (whilst half the people were asleep and the other half were getting annoyed that the TVs had stopped working), there was a massive bang and the whole plane launched into hysteria.\\n\\nI can\\'t even explain how loud it was, especially given the plane was in near silence. Immediately, every baby started screaming as loudly as they could and every mother started crying madly. It didn\\'t help that it was pitch black either, so all the flight crew running around amongst the panicking masses couldn\\'t see where they were going at all, so just ran straight into all the passengers as they jumped out of their seats. The people who had been sleeping woke up to a scene normally saved for badly produced films and needless to say also began manically hyperventilating.\\n\\nAfter a few minutes of sheer terror, the lights came back on and everyone gradually calmed down. My travel bag was revealed as the source of the blast - obviously to my surprise - and was carefully opened. Tons of what looked like sawdust/powder fell out onto the chairs below and once again everyone freaked out for a few seconds.\\n\\nAs it turns out, in India they hyper inflate their crisp/chip packets so the contents don\\'t get crushed. They\\'re also dirt cheap, so I bought about 8 packets (those were the snacks I\\'d grabbed in a rush earlier). The pressure built up as we ascended, and when the plane jolted from the turbulence, they all blew up simultaneously. \\n\\nAnd **that** is how I accidentally triggered a bomb scare on an international flight.\\n\\n\\n**\\n\\nTL;DR: I made the mistake of squashing lots of hyper inflated chip packets into my bag on a flight and they all exploded. Everyone lost their minds. okay so this happened over the weekend and today. \\nOn Friday, i went to view an apartment. I had talked to the landlord on the phone and was seeing the apartment with the super. \\nSo i see the apartment, everything’s great, get an application, fill it all out and email it to the landlord. \\n\\nI get a call from him a few hours later, just going over details of my application and he offers me the apt. I’m going to go in on monday to sign the lease. \\n\\nOkay so now it’s Saturday night and i’m just swiping through tinder and match with a cute guy, mid 30s, (im 20). let’s call him steve\\nhe messaged me, we flirt, he comes over to my place. we have mediocre sex at best, then he leaves to go home. \\n\\nSo monday rolls around and I go to the apartment building to sign the lease and tie up any loose ends\\n\\nI walk up the building and steve is standing outside with a woman and i see he has some papers in his hand. \\n\\nThe woman waves to me and introduces herself as steve’s WIFE. steve looks totally chill, while i’m freaking outside but trying to remain calm. I did not sign up for this. \\n\\nAnyway, i feel bad for his wife and i feel like a horrible person even though i had no idea that he was married. \\nCan’t wait to live there for a whole year! \\n\\n \\nTL;DR \\nSlept with my landlord without knowing who he was and found out he has a wife.\\n\\nEDIT: YALL IM A GUY. sorry, i didn’t clarify that in the original. \\n\\nEDIT 2: wow this blew up what the hell. i’m not going to tell his wife because 1) id like for her to not kick me out of the apt and 2:) as many people have pointed out they could be in an open relationship and i don’t want to accuse him of cheating and make things messy or weird.\\n\\nEDIT 3: yes i used protection, i’m always safe. Edit: spelling \\n\\nSorry for formatting I am on an iPhone edit: and throwaway \\n\\nI’ve ( 27F) had trouble sleeping at night since I was a child , finding out my boyfriend (32M) of two years also has trouble sleeping at night we decided to both download an app that basically records movement , snoring , extra noise and your level of consciousness.\\n  \\nNow , I am known for eating right before bed and recently my doctor had recommended that I add more fibre to my diet along with some sleeping pills . This was my first fuck up. Unknowingly to me fibre causes MAD GAS. the kind noise that is only found by a heard of elephants running though a concrete desert. \\n\\nMonths have gone by and I started to sleep better than I ever had before due to the pills and diet change , forgetting all about the app. But one concerning thing was that my boyfriend was starting to feel distant. I would wake up in the morning and he would have made his way down to the couch until I got up and came down . No arguments nothing of the obvious I could wrap my pea brain around at the time but as anyone would I started to get suspicious there was someone else. \\n\\nAbout an hour ago , I remembered the app records noise and decided if I checked the app I should be able to tell what time he is getting up and leaving the bedroom and maybe see if his phone rings or anything of that sort to try to piece together why my lovely caveman was leaving me to go sleep downstairs. \\n\\nWELL LET ME TELL YOU. \\nI Found out why.\\nAnd I am about to reveal my sad embarrassing truth to you. \\n\\nI have been indiscriminately but vigorously farting the most thunderous claps from the depths of hell you can imagine. I mean there was 124 recordings from last night alone , as soon as I fall asleep I start letting them RIP unknowingly because of the strength of the sleepers. 124 times my sphincter deceived me . And to make it worse , I sleep on my side shimmied into him with my butt and back. So I’ve been hitting him with the devils breath directly ON HIM. and after about 10 of these clappers you hear Rustling and footsteps and low mumbling of cursing the whole way until the door slams. \\n\\nSo my friends , do not take too much fibre and sleeping pills if you don’t want your significant other to mildly dislike you and be distant \\n\\nTL;DR changed my diet to more fibre , took sleeping pills to knock me out , recorded myself blowing gas as strong as a whale coming up to breathe.\\n\\nEdit: since you guys are wondering I did bring it up to him when he first started to go to the couch and he just shrugged it off saying he’s having a hard time sleeping in the bed  and I was not buying it lol\\n\\nEDIT: Okay so he is out for the evening , but I will text him now to confront him because you guys are making feel funny about it instead of embarrassed and I will come back with an update\\n\\nEdit ok it took me forever to figure out how to post photos to Reddit but I think I got it :\\n\\n[confrontational text ](https://m.imgur.com/jZmwtLD?r) \\n\\n[confrontational text ](https://m.imgur.com/gallery/74Z4yLI)\\n\\nEdit : I sent him this post and we are now having a great laugh about it. Thank you for all the stories I enjoyed every single one lol\\n\\nEdit Ok I’m sorry for all the edits but the app is - sleep booster : auto tracker\\nEdit: I recommend getting a different one for this one costs a fair bit to use the basic features while some are free for the same feats\\n\\nEdit : okay guys I will post the recordings when I go on break I’m heading to work now\\n\\nEdit : still going to post the recordings on break but just wanted to address this because it’s in every few comments -  I am a paramedic so my shifts are very long leaning from 12-16 hours and usually disable me from eating the last 4 hours ish of my shift for that is the busiest time .. Once I’m off I eat and go straight to bed so I will be trying to prevent myself from doing that or packing extra lunch to snack on at work. Thank you all lol. \\n\\nEdit : okay last edit .. A lot of you have asked for the recording and a lot of you are asking for me not to post it. To safe my face and peoples ears, and If it’s allowed I will just get you to inbox me if you want to hear it and I will send it when I can lol ( hopefully this is allowed and works )\\n\\nEdit: can anyone explain to me how to send a file through inbox lol\\n\\nOkay y’all win I can’t send them via inbox so here we go. I had to cut it really short because he says my name multiple times but this is my I believe worst fart of the night L O L enjoy. And If you don’t want to hear it I don’t recommend opening lol \\n\\n[fart tax ](https://imgur.com/gallery/EJP1dwQ) This happened just a few minutes ago. My wife\\'s face is still a mess and I\\'m sitting here with an ice-pack on my dick. Alternate account because I don\\'t want my family reading this.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo my wife and I were trying to get in the mood tonight. It\\'s been a rough couple of weeks as I am sure it has been for everyone. I\\'m a physician dealing with coronavirus at work while experiencing a massive paycut, meanwhile my wife\\'s been working from home while managing the kids who have been home from school. Needless to say we\\'ve had a lot of anxiety and stress on our plate but we\\'re committed to making time for each other. \\n\\nSo we are getting in bed and she wants me to tie her up and tickle her. I get her in position and give her a little slap to get things started, and I mean a little slap. Suddenly, she starts crying. Initially, I thought it was a joke but she just kept going. Within a few seconds she\\'s sobbing, tears are everywhere. I undo her knots and try to comfort her with little success. The floodgates open and she starts pouring out about her worries with the mortgage, my health, and on and on. After what felt like an eternity, she begins to calm down. \\n\\nObviously, I\\'m no longer in the mood and I didn\\'t think she was either, so I suggest we just go to bed. She feels guilty and insists we can still have sex. I tell her it\\'s ok let\\'s just go to bed. We go back and forth about this for a bit. Then I start to roll away but I guess in her guilt she grabs my pants and frantically starts to pull them down. Before I can stop her she accidentally grabs my penis and yanks it like a lawnmower starter. I drop to the floor in agony and she suddenly realizes what she just did... so seconds later we\\'re now both rolling on the bed crying. I ended up with a rug-burn in a very sensitive spot and after another eternity of crying, my wife\\'s face is beet-red and puffy. \\n\\ntldr: I slapped my wife during foreplay and she cried, in her guilt for killing the mood, she tried to take my pants off and yanked on my dick giving me a rug-burn. I\\'ve been laughing at myself for the whole of today so I thought I would share this with you, it\\'s probably not as funny as I think it is, but alas. \\n\\nFor context, I\\'ve just finished school and I\\'m looking for temporary jobs over the summer so I can get a bit of money for when university starts. I have been looking at a number of job sites and I have applied for three jobs. I have the setting to search for temporary jobs near me when I saw another advert. \\n\\nThis was for a job at a well-known shoe company that has two separate stores in my city. On the job advert, it didn\\'t say which one the vacancy was for, it just said in Edinburgh. This is where I\\'m from. So I started the application process and put in my details and CV. Now it was all going well until there was a slightly confusing question asking if I had the right to work in the USA. \\n\\nNow, this definitely confused me but I ticked no and opened the job advert again. I searched it from my computer and it still said the job was in Edinburgh and that it was within 5 miles of me.  I thought huh, strange but I\\'ll tick no and if they don\\'t want me I won\\'t hear from them, no big deal. \\n\\nAnyway later on I received an email saying they had checked my CV and they wanted to conduct a virtual interview. I was very surprised because it was less than a day after I had applied but I was happy that I thought I might have a job there. So I selected the time for 1 pm the next day (today) thinking nothing more of it. I\\'m good at interviews so I didn\\'t feel the need to prep. \\n\\nAnyway, I got a very polite email shortly before the interview from a very confused manager of the store who had looked at my details. \\n\\nHe asked me why I was applying for a job in Edinburgh Indiana when I was based in Scotland. When I read the email my jaw absolutely dropped because the job wasn\\'t \"In Edinburgh\" it was IN Edinburgh, Edinburgh Indiana USA. \\n\\nI\\'m not from the USA so it never dawned on me that it could be a state code and not just in Edinburgh Scotland. I sent him a very apologetic email but I\\'m just glad he noticed before what I imagine would be an incredibly awkward job interview, although that definitely would have been a good laugh. \\n\\nIf this does well I\\'m sure I can link the job interview and his email in case anyone wants to make sure this actually happened but I can\\'t be bothered right now. \\n\\nTLDR: Accidentally applied for a job in a town with the exact same name as mine 6000 km away and didn\\'t notice until a store manager sent me a polite email asking why I was applying there.\\n\\nEdit [IN-Edinburgh rather than Edinburgh, IN. ](https://imgur.com/gallery/7Lkoy06)\\n\\n[The rather confused manager\\'s email (with names and emails omitted.)](https://imgur.com/gallery/o0izb66)\\n\\n[My reply to the manager](https://imgur.com/gallery/BdMqWZj)\\n\\nEdit: I\\'m so happy to read though all your comments and to have made so many people laugh. I\\'m trying to get through and reply to as many comments as I can but I\\'m really happy to have made some people day better!\\n\\nEdit: Also thanks for making me feel less stupid with all your amazing stories about messing up and booking places in opposite parts of the USA, States and whole different continents!\\n\\nEdit: I\\'ve been trying to work my way through all of your comments but I\\'m going to bed now and I don\\'t know if I will do that tomorrow as well. Thanks so much though. https://www.reddit.com/r/brooklynninenine/comments/abvh3w/just_found_the_nicest_guy_in_the_minneapolis/?st=JQFYEYJC&sh=29906472\\nSorry I’m on mobile, but this is the original post\\n\\n\\nSo this fuck up is only like 10 hours old.\\n\\nThis morning, I was at the airport to head back to school. I look ahead in the security like an I see Joel McKinnon Miller AKA Detective Scully from Brooklyn Nine-Nine. My sister takes a picture of us and I’m on my way. While waiting for Coffee I decide to post the picture on the subreddit. I get on my flight and it’s at 100 or so upvotes. I land and I’m at 4K updates and have a whole slew of comments congratulating me for coming out. I go and look back at the title of the post and find out I said “came out to him” instead of “came up to him.” I’m at 25.4k upvotes now and am still getting comments on people congratulating me for coming out...\\n\\n\\nAlso most of my swim team knows about the post and now I’m never living down the whole “accidentally came out on the internet” thing...\\n\\nTL;DR- Met a celebrity, ended up accidentally coming out to the entire internet\\n\\nEdit: to make explicitly clear, no I am not gay.    Happened an hour ago on lunch, so a real tifu for you guys. On Wednesday’s our department head takes everyone out for a long lunch, it’s a special time we all look forward to in our boring 45 hour work week. It is normal to carpool all together and naturally I drive my two friend-coworkers each time. However this week we have a new hire just out of grad school, we’ll call her Sarah (changed). She’s quickly picking up pace with the rest of the office and settling in nicely. While everyone is leaving the office for lunch I offer her a ride in my car with the other two and she agrees and hops in the passenger seat. Now here’s where the first fuck up happens.\\n   While on the way to the restaurant Sarah is picking up on the group dynamic and tagging in on some good banter. Everything is going smooth and then while crossing into an intersection the car in front of us gets swiped by someone who thought they could make the right turn in time. Traffic comes to a halt and I slam on the breakers and in doing so reach out to my right to stop her from flying forward. I check to see we are all good and everyone is okay while realizing I am currently full on honkin Sarah’s right knocker my words start to trail off. “Damn I hope everyone is oka.....” that kind of sentence that time slows down in, yeah. Amazingly she laughs it off and says not to worry about it that I was just reacting to the situation. For the next few minutes the car was silent until Sarah said “that’s funny I haven’t had that much action in a while” which eased the mood and the car all laughed. And fuck up number two comes from my dumb ass saying “ahh well we all have our dry spells.” Something I thought was innocent enough but still playing along with the banter we had going earlier. She goes quiet the rest of the car starts chatting again. \\n   We get to lunch and everything seems okay but Sarah is a little off and not as bright or talkative as she was in the morning so I ask what’s up. She told me she was a little uneasy at my comment in the car. I instantly apologized saying I had no reason to talk about her sexuality and her private life and that I was sorry. She said she didn’t care about that and that it was fine it’s just that it reminded her of the anniversary of her husbands death coming up next month. My heart sunk. I had completely forgotten about her husband. I felt so bad I instantly started apologizing for everything in the world I felt horrible. My friend overheard this and just was white in the face, he seemed mortified to even spectate this conversation. Sarah ended up going home early about 15 minutes ago but stopped by my desk to tell me not to worry about anything from lunch. I feel so horrible that I have been sitting here unproductive writing a reddit post to cope with it. Please reddit help me feel a little better.\\n\\nTLDR: I yanked a widows titty\\n\\nedit:*formatting* p.s. - damn I didn\\'t check this for hours until I got home, thanks for all the kind words and your internet points, I never thought I\\'d be given gold for stopping short thanks! This TIFU has been in the making since last September. This is a throwaway account, as my real one is known to my friends.\\n\\nLate last summer I started having some heart problems; irregular heartbeat, high pulse and the works. Naturally my family doctor prescribed a daily 25mg tablet of metoprolol, which kept the symptoms to a minimum. I\\'m a pretty private guy, so nobody but my close family knew.\\n\\nThough I’ve always been pretty healthy, that was the wake-up call I needed to start working out. Beside hitting the gym, I also joined a sharpshooting club, and was I was natural at it. Over the course of a few months I moved from shooting prone with a help of a few sandbags to shooting standing up. My aim was steady, breathing as slow as possible, heartbeat minimal.\\n\\nI’m pretty sure you guys have already made the connection between the heart meds and my fantastic performance, but I sure as hell didn’t. In the meantime a cardiologist said “Tough shit” and bumped up the meds.\\n\\nDuring the course of this school year I was consistently better than the other newcomers at sharpshooting, winning small tournaments in the club. Soon they decided to have me participate in a bigger tournament, with an actual prize. The stakes were high, but I was a stone cold shooter. Later that day checking out my Fitbit, I found that my pulse had never gone over 85, and that was when I had to bicycle over the the range.\\n\\nFlash forward 2 more tournaments to today. My friend jokingly mentioned that I must’ve been doping to do so well and the dots connected. I googled “metoprolol doping”, there it was. I still haven’t told anyone, but Reddit. What the hell do I do now?\\n\\nTL:DR Started taking beta blockers for heart problems, joined a sharpshooting club and won 3 tournaments by unknowingly using a common doping drug. I receive ketamine infusions every few weeks as part of my medical care. Today I arrived to the doctor a bit early so was killing time on my phone, where I came across this article:\\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thecut.com/amp/2019/07/art-student-dick-pic-painting-tinder.html\\nI read it, looked at a few other things, and then it was time for my treatment.\\n\\nThe dose of ketamine I receive is therapeutic, not recreational, but I definitely experience some of the side effects of the drug. Usually I see a lot of colors, fly through space tunnels, that kind of thing. It’s very relaxing. Not today. Today I saw dicks. Dicks everywhere. I flew through a tunnel of dicks. I twirled through a field of dicks. I looked through a kaleidoscope of dicks. It’s like every dick I’ve ever seen made an appearance. \\n\\nTL; DR: Looked at a painting of 140 dicks before ketamine infusions; ended up looking at 140,000 psychedelic dicks for an hour.\\n\\nEDIT: (1) I’m a middle-aged, married lady. I’m only interested in my husband’s dick, which I’m sure was in there somewhere. (2) I receive treatments for Bipolar 2 disorder, which is characterized by longer depressive periods and shorter hypomanic periods. Ketamine is the only thing that’s allowed me to avoid the crippling effects of mood episodes. I’ve been able to reduce my other medications which had side effects I didn’t like, and I’ve been able to go off of anti-anxiety medications completely. (3) I don’t do recreational drugs and have never tried anything like that—not even weed. I also only have maybe ten drinks per year. (4) My doctor is the one who said I don’t get a recreational dose. He was really clear about that. Maybe he was downplaying things so I wouldn’t seek out illegal ketamine. I’m very creative, and my doctor has told me I’m “highly suggestible” and that I have the most vivid ketamine dreams of any of his patients. Not sure if that makes a difference. I would most definitely not try anything recreationally. (5) I’m not a doctor and not in the medical field. I don’t know if ketamine treatments will help you. They help me, but YMMV. I felt relief within 72 hours of my first infusion. Anyone remember the TIFU of the guy that suck his own dick in front of his assistant at a Bachelorette party? He included a drawing of how he did that.\\n\\nSo my boyfriend was doing some stretches on bed, and one of the stretches is the same pose as what that guy drew.\\n\\nI commented about it and said \"Hey that\\'s how the TIFU guy sucked his own dick.\" \\n\\nMy boyfriend being silly then try to see if he can reach his too and I gave him a little push.\\nObviously he isn\\'t as flexible (just like how most people are not) and I said;\\n\\n\"Well it\\'s okay, he did mention afterall that he also have a big dick\"\\n\\nAnd in that moment I felt as if time slowed down and I can see his face going into this super disappointed look.\\n\\nAnd that is how I fucked up by hurting his feelings.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: I told my boyfriend he have a small dick indirectly and unintentionally and hurt his feelings\\n\\nEdit: Y\\'ALL NEED TO CHILL. I never did mention that his dick is actually small (and to clarify, hell no it isn\\'t).\\nTo give more context, it all happened in a light hearted and silly mood. Sure his feelings probably got hurt for a while (can\\'t deny that horrified look I saw) but obviously I reassured him and we laughed about it. \\n\\nReason I posted this is because my boyfriend is the one that casually mentioned about posting here, and I am curious what kind of reaction it\\'ll get\\n\\nWe are now both laughing at how worked up some of you actually got ;) \\n\\nAnd thank you to those random redditers that find this post worthy of even a silver lol. \\n\\nOkay so this literally just happened. Im dying slowly from the embarrassment, and cant believe it happened to me. \\n\\nOn Snapchat we have a work group chat that I post on pretty frequently. Well tonight my SO asked me to send her a video of me masturbating cause she gets off on that and we haven\\'t been able to see each other in a couple days do to our schedules. I always check to see if i added any other names to what i send by accident but i recently  just upgraded phones from my note 5 to galaxy 8+ which doesn\\'t have a home button. So apparently as i went to press send i have the horrible habit of sliding my thumb across the screen since im used to having an actual area there. \\n\\nI realized my misfortune the moment i pressed sent. Since im also a frequent poster everyone opened it immediately and i just want to die. It wasnt just a regular video either, it was like a volcano erupted if you know what i mean...i just want to hide. Its about to be very awkward at work tomorrow \\n\\n\\nTL;DR Dont slide your fingers across the screen when pressing send  because i accidently sent a video of a volcanic eruption of me playing pocket pool to my work group chat\\n\\n\\nUpdate: So im not getting fired luckily. Im at work right now but the jokes have definitely started. Ive heard so many Michael Jackson just beat it references its unreal. The group chat is mostly comprised of people I go to college with. Even the manager is a college student, but the embarrassment is still the same. My boss just laughed it off and told me just because im cool with everyone, i probably shouldn\\'t post my dick in the groupchat.  Also holy fuck this blew up! Thank you for the gold, the fake internet karma and fame is helping me cope a little bit at least.\\n\\nEdit 2: People think im lying so group chat image for proof added https://imgur.com/cUKvx5w.jpg\\n\\n\\nEdit 3: just got off work, and apparently people still dont believe thus happened  so heres me and my SO conversation after it happened.  With the time on  the SS cause I sent it to the group chat so they knew what was going on\\n https://imgur.com/H8eJnLg.jpg Today my cousin bought an 8 inch black realistic suction cup dildo as a birthday present for my brother, whom in horror discarded the obscene dingus. Being the saint that I am, I adopted this orphaned device. \\n\\nMy friend and I provided the poor discarded ornament with a purpose, I replaced the toilet roll holder with our new trinket, which worked fabulously. \\n\\nHowever, the mere potential of comical joy to be experienced was wasted on such a mundane destiny, and thus I proceeded to stick the suction end to my forehead and become the unicorn I was meant to be... I had reached my comical peak. As we cackled at the flailing 8 inch dick upon my forehead I could feel something was terribly wrong. \\n\\nI heard a loud squelching pop as the large appendage detached, my friend looked at me in horror. Upon my forehead I had been crested with the biggest hickey possibly to have existed in the past millennia. The curse spot consists of a large darkening purple oval of approximately 6cm by 3cm. \\n\\nI leave for Italy in 8 hours for my summer holiday.... my friends won’t be able to look at me in the eyes. I fear for what the security at the airport may think of my battle wound. \\n\\nTL;DR: Stuck an 8-inch suction-cup dildo to my forehead, now left with giant hickey hours before I depart for Venice...\\n\\nEDIT: Some visual aids: https://imgur.com/a/I9zxIrc\\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/zseCPGf TIFU by telling a black lady the carriers are only for the whites.\\n\\nOn mobile so sorry for formatting and such. \\n\\nThis happened last week and I still wince when I think about it..\\n\\nI run a smoothie truck in a smallish southern city in the US. I was fairly busy making several drinks with my back to my service window. Next to my machine I have several drink carriers with handles. The lady sees them and asks if she can have the carrier with handles for her drinks, I tell her I’m sorry but those carriers are only for the Whites. \\n\\nAs soon as the words left my mouth I could have died. I dropped the smoothie I was working on and did an about face so fast the truck rocked. \\n\\nI looked at the lady, the black lady, and just started apologizing, trying to explain. \\n\\nThe Whites are a family of 7. The father comes by twice a week gets drinks for the family and at some point he bought and gave me X amount of carriers for him to use to make his trips easier. Turns out she knows the Whites, she goes to church with them. Thank you, Jesus. \\n\\nShe couldn’t have been nicer over the ordeal and I still feel horrible about the whole thing. \\n\\nI have since put the carriers out of view.\\n\\nTL;DR I told a black lady the drink carriers are only for the White family, but made it sound like they were only for the white families. This actually did happen within the last 24 hours, I\\'m still lying in bed trying to recover. \\n\\nSo, weed has been legalized, yay Canada! Obviously, the first weekend after legalization, getting fucked up is in order. My girlfriend and I had a free weekend (kids weren\\'t here), and that won\\'t happen again for a while, which adds further justification. But we live in an apartment building, we don\\'t want to stink everything up, so we decided to do edibles.\\n\\nI figured, hey, let\\'s keep it conservative, never done this before, don\\'t want to put too much in there, right? I mean, not that weed can ever be that bad, haha, it\\'s just marijuana. Fucking harmless. So I spend the morning and afternoon decarbing 3.5 grams of MK ULTRA and infusing it into half a cup of butter, which was then used to make brownies. Which were quite good.\\n\\nWe cut this shit into about 15 equal pieces. Now, I am still at this moment struggling with the math, which is pathetic given that we spent two hours trying to figure it out last night. But, I\\'m pretty sure that works out to 232 mg per brownie. *APPARENTLY* you should start with 10 mg. See how that goes. But on Friday night, we vaped through about 2 full grams and I didn\\'t feel a damn thing.\\n\\nWe started with two brownies each. Two hours later, my girlfriend was fucked up. I was fine. So I had another one. An hour later, she could barely walk. I didn\\'t feel it as bad as her. So, I had one more. That\\'s 6/15, not even half the batch between us.\\n\\nTurns out MJ is a helluva drug. Jesus Mother-fucking Christ. We spent about 6 hours completely fucked up. Oh my lawd, I had no fucking clue that that level of impairment was possible from weed. My mind is blown. I could not talk properly; sipping from a cup was this \"big deal\" where my girlfriend and I had to talk me through and encourage me; rolling over was this totally confusing repeated realization that there\\'s a *whole other half of this room to look at*, wow!\\n\\nWe were wrecked. About halfway through, it went from being a laughfest to being a grim holding on. We just held hands and encouraged each other not to panic. My girlfriend thought she was dying, she was reciting her last will and testament to herself. She wanted to call an ambulance. None of this is hyperbole. We\\'re both exhausted and sore from the twitching. The dry mouth might\\'ve been the worst part. It was incredibly intense, we had trouble talking because our mouths were so dry. \\n\\nWe threw the rest of the brownies out. The smell of weed is going to make me nauseous for weeks probably.\\n\\nTLDR: 125lb woman ingests half a gram of weed in brownies, 205lb man ingests almost a full gram. Both are amazed to discover that weed can in fact profoundly fuck them up. It waaaaaay too much.\\n\\nEdit: thanks for the gold! And silver! And platinum! Kinda worth it...?\\n\\nEdit 2: yes, it is a tragedy about throwing the brownies out. I honestly, sincerely hate the waste. But we couldn\\'t even look at them this morning without our stomachs flip-flopping, and we absolutely could not risk the kids getting them. That would be unforgivably irresponsible. \\n\\nEdit 3: I *DID* do research, I just didn\\'t do enough. We have now learned correct math from the comments. You\\'re **supposed** to dose edibles using the THC percentage. This stuff has been tested at 18%. So, using that estimate, with 233 mg of weed per brownie, she had 84 mg and I had 168... Holy fuck.\\n\\nEdit 4: I used the double boil mason jar method for about 60 min to decarb, then dropped a 1/2 cup of butter into the jar and let it boil for another 80 minutes. Every 10 minutes I topped up the water and shook the mixture around in the jar. There wasn\\'t much smell at all. I can confidently state that this method works well enough to get a person high.\\n\\n**Final edit**: Some important safety tips from someone who read the safety tips and didn\\'t get it, and is now learning from hundreds of comments. For those making **positive** contributions, thank you! We\\'re enjoying them! \\n1. They say wait at least 2 hours before having another. *Wait longer*! Like, a day. It is not worth the risk of having too much.\\n2. There\\'s a general agreement that edibles are much stronger, and that even someone with a respectable tolerance for smoking might get annihilated.\\n3. There\\'s a lot of stories here where the impairment lasted days. I fucked up even bigger by not fully considering that. So keep that in mind.  This happened last month.\\n\\nI have a wonderful wife, and even though we are in our late thirties and have three kids, we still like to copulate on a recreational level. \\n\\nNow, my wife can be hard to please. She’s a slow starter, and has a hard time reaching an orgasm from intercourse, which means that once I’m finished I’m dedicated to helping her reach the finish line too. This can take an additional 90 minutes from any previous coital activities. Frankly, it’s the hardest workout of my life, and often leaves me with a tennis elbow and inability to pronounce words for 30 minutes after. On the plus side I often don’t have time to do the dishes after.\\n\\nNow, I’d say I’m more of an attentive lover than a good one. I tend to think of the female orgasm as a beat ‘em up on Playstation — if I just push all the buttons something special has to happen sooner or later. Over the years I’ve come to identify which buttons my wife likes to have pressed, and I’ve realized part of her being a slow starter stems from her being able to orgasm multiple times until she reaches a huge finale with a standing ovation, fireworks etc.\\n\\nThis means that any amorous activities need to fit into our packed time schedule. It had been a while since we were able to put the little monsters asleep at a reasonable time, which had probably led to a loss of form on my behalf.\\n\\nLast month we were able to git ‘er done, as our local priest likes to put it.\\n\\nThis time, like an amateur, I tried to match her and make her reach climax first. So I’m mixing intense lovemaking with pulling out and going to town on her to help her reach her destination.\\n\\nThrough no fault of my own, my wife seems to enjoy it. She is having multiple of the minor orgasms, and I’m clinging on for dear life, hoping that she will reach the big one already, and also trying very hard to remember not to say that out loud. I’m a sweaty mess, the room is really warm, and I’d like to take a break for a sip of water and turning a fan on. Or to send in a replacement. Also, we will probably have to buy a new sofa.\\n\\nWe keep going at it, my pelvis is thrusting like a jackhammer on the fritz, and my tummy is making weird sounds.\\n\\nSuddenly, my entire stomach decides that if I’m dumb enough to keep going despite its many warnings, it will take matters into its own hands. \\n\\nThe worst pain I’ve ever suffered suddenly hits me mid-thrust, as my intestines try to break free of their confinement. I fold like Rivaldo during the World Cup 2002, doubling over on top of my wife, who thinks I can no longer resist her sexiness and am about to fall asleep in five minutes. “I love you”, she whispers in my ear. “I’m dying,” I croak in return.\\n\\nI finally push myself to my feet, and try to make it to my phone on the TV table to call 911. It’s no good. I fall to the floor in a little ball of pain. It feels like the stomach is trying to rearrange the guts but can’t decide where everything goes. After what feels like an eternity, the crashing waves of pain start to ebb out.\\n\\nMy wife stands over me with a slightly worried expression. “You ok?”\\n\\n“Just cramps,”  I pant as I realize what just happened to me, finally realizing why people would drown from cramps.\\n\\n“Oh.” She’s quiet for a beat. “Can we go again?”\\n\\nI have spent the last month getting real exercise in a gym, and taking up stretching. I’ve also realized that if I ever come close to dying, I’m properly fucked unless my wife has been too.\\n\\nTLDR: The one time I didn’t please my wife it nearly killed me.\\n\\nEdit: Someone gave me a “I’m deceased” award, and I want to say thank you and that this was a close one, but I’m still very much alive.\\n\\nEdit2: Holy crap, this is blowing up. I’m trying to respond to all of you and the comments are a truly entertaining read! To those of you calling it a humblebrag or a boast about having sex — Hell yes I got laid! But I also try to explain that much of the time I have no idea what I’m doing, so I’m not trying to toot my own horn here. I leave the tooting of horns to my wife.\\n\\nEdit3: I would like to give a big thank you to all the wonderful people who have given rewards for this post. Thank you!\\n\\nAs for my TLDR, a lot of people are unhappy with it. I’m sorry for that; it’s the result of being a first-time poster in this subreddit. I don’t want to change it now after the fact, but I’ll try to improve on it if I ever fuck up again. Throwaway.  Well it was around noon when I ate my pasta.  Shortly after that I found myself to be slightly off-kilter and queasy but in great spirits.  I initially attributed the feeling to that 2nd cup of coffee I shouldn\\'t have had.  At 2pm it was my hour-long lunch break which I always use for some gym time.  As I was walking out of the office I realized that this wasn\\'t just the caffeine talking.  The possibility that I was in fact, tripping, didn\\'t even occur to me until this point when realized how it could have happened, and sure enough, it did.  Somehow.  Life finds a way.  Saturday morning I had prepared some \\'gummy bears\\' for my friends using the translucent Tupperware lid as the backdrop. Some of the residue must have lived through the night.  On Sunday I made a bunch of pasta and started eating straight out of the Tupperware.  I put the lid on and didn\\'t think twice about it.  Today I ate leftovers at work that must have been contaminated by the container.  Or maybe I laid my fork on the lid, then licked that fork...mmmyeah.  I\\'m honestly perplexed how eating the pasta could have dosed me since I microwaved that shit for a few minutes and it\\'s my limited understanding that high temperature will often nullify the drug. It did though and by the time I had walked to the gym I knew damn well what was coming my way.   Well anyway, I went to the gym and worked out pretty intensely for 40 minutes in an effort to blow off all the nervous steam and jitters.  The work-out was rather standard except for a brief moment where, lost in concentration, I started walking out of the gym then got slightly disoriented when I didn\\'t know where I was going, or why.  I pulled myself together and took a cold shower then took a nice long walk outside before I had to take the plunge.  I did my best to act like a normal human upon re-entry.  I cracked one joke (that actually went over really well with half the office) before admonishing myself to behave. My behavior was normal except for when I forgot my co-workers name during an introduction.  We had a new team-member start today and I had to give her a tour.   I don\\'t think she could tell I was fucked up but I know I was sweating a lot and rambling.  I now have another 50 minutes before I very non-nonchalantly walk out of the office, secret intact, and take a very long walk home.  What a fucking Monday.\\n\\nTL;DR: Accidentally dosed myself and had to spend the rest of the day pretending I was a normal, sober, middle-level manager at the office. This happened about 30 minutes ago, it\\'s 4am and I\\'m tired and stupid for this. \\n\\nI\\'m one of those people, where if I fall asleep I sometimes forget what I was doing before I went to sleep.\\n\\nSo I was playing RE7 in VR, but it was getting kinda late but I wanted to stay up and play anyways. I started to fall asleep, and just passed out kinda instantly.\\n\\nThen I woke up, my head felling weirdly heavy. BUT HOLY SHIT I JUST WOKE UP AND ALL I CAN SEE AROUND ME IS A DARK ROOM WITH SOME TABLES CHAIRS ALL I CAN HEAR ARE CREEPY NOISES AND ITS DARK OUTSIDE AND  I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE I AM. \\n\\nSo logically I stand up from my chair( i didn\\'t even check to look, but I\\'m pretty sure my in game guy was standing) and run and scream.\\n\\nSomehow my arm got around my monitor( or maybe a cord idk), I also ran into the wall (which made no sense to me because I wasn\\'t even near a wall), and then it happened.\\n\\nI start to feel hands all around me(my mom), and the feeling of something come in or out of my ear(my earbuds that I didn\\'t know were there), and the sound of my mom asking \"What the hell, are you ok?\"\\n\\nShe took the headset off of me, and I see the destruction I did to my monitor, and the small dent/damage to the wall. \\n\\nMy mom laughed her ass off at me, and told me we will talk about it tomorrow. \\n\\n\\ntl;dr slept with scary game on, thought it was my reality. broke stuff by accident and feel dumb. UPDATE POST HERE:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c6m476/tifu\\\\_update\\\\_letting\\\\_my\\\\_nephew\\\\_use\\\\_my\\\\_fortnite/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c6m476/tifu_update_letting_my_nephew_use_my_fortnite/)   \\n\\n\\nMaybe you already know where this is going.\\n\\nMy niece and nephew are the best niece and nephew an uncle could ask for. They\\'re bright,  kind, good-natured kids. My niece (who we\\'ll call L), and my nephew (who we\\'ll call W) don\\'t have many games on their PSN account, so being the ~~cool~~ stupid uncle I am, I game them access to my PSN account, to play my far superior collection of games.All was well for about a month. I knew they couldn\\'t buy games on the account because all payments require a card verification number.\\n\\nBut imagine my surprise yesterday when I get this message on facebook...\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"A\\\\_Sad\\\\_Frog, can you check your bank? \"\\n\\nIt was my brother in law. L and W\\'s father.\\n\\n\"W is playing Fortnite and he has 65,000 V bucks, is this normal?\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy heart stopped. Their parents are great people, but not particularly savvy with gaming / consoles / microcurrency.[I went to my transaction history on PSN, and nearly threw up when I saw this](https://imgur.com/a/qZu4SCN)**(identifying details have been cropped out):**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAll told, £422.90 ($531) had been siphoned out over a week, with most of the bombardment happening yesterday. By the time I got back into to account to assess the damage, 20,000 vbucks had already been spent. I saw that the Playstation wallet can be topped up before each purchase, so they must have paid for it by first buying wallet currency, which apparently didn\\'t require a code. That\\'s **FU number 1.**\"Tell them to stop what they\\'re doing. Shut off your PS4. I have to sort this out\".\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI immediately unhooked any bank cards from the account, and looked at what my options were. **NOTHING**. PlayStation store doesn\\'t have protections against accidental purchases like this, and the best they can do is refund the amount back into your playstation wallet. This is money that can never be accessed again, except for buying games or motherF\\\\*ng V bucks or some other bullsh\\\\*t currency. For all intents and purposes, I have lost that money. The bank can\\'t do anything about it.\\n\\nSo here\\'s where it gets really messed up. **FU number 2**. My girlfriend is visiting family in the US, and was **storing her savings for the trip** in that account. She will have expenses sorted because she\\'s staying with family, but she will be going with virtually zero spending money now, and they had a number of activites planned which she likely can\\'t take part in now. That was a very difficult phonecall, and she handled it better than I ever could have expected, and far better than I deserved.\\n\\nI\\'m not mad at the kids. I genuinely don\\'t think they meant it. I\\'m mad at myself. I didn\\'t think it was possible, but then I should have done more research. I feel so terribly terribly guilty for putting my girlfriend in this situation, the kids are upset that they did it, their parents are currently suffering from stage 4 embarrassment cancer, and all around the whole thing is just F\\'ed. We\\'re not a rich couple, and this one has hit us both pretty hard.\\n\\nSo, fair warning, **double check that your payment security features on PSN are set up properly** or you could end up getting thoroughly shafted as we did.\\n\\n**TLDR:** Left my PlayStation account to the mercy of my 5 year old nephew, who spent all of my girlfriend\\'s holiday money on vbucks, mostly in the space of a day.\\n\\n**EDIT:** A couple of people have mentioned that we get email notifications on a purchase. This is true, but it\\'s set up on a different email that wasn\\'t set up on our phones to notify us. It would have **dramatically** improved the outcome of this if we had done that. **FU number 3** confirmed.\\n\\n**UPDATE #1:** Playstation support was closed for phonecalls today, so it will be tomorrow (monday) when I can contact them. Obligatory this happened yesterday. This girl and I had a fun filled day out on the town. Afterwards we got a hotel. Things started getting hot and heavy and my fingers ended up in her pants. One thing led to another and I started fingering her. She was having a grand old time showing the usual signs that I was doing a decent job. A good portion of the way through my nails must have given her a bit of a cut and she said ou.... and passed out cold. I\\'m sitting her wondering what the fuck just happened. I call her name and start panicingly shaking her. She\\'s not responsive and I slap her face. As soon as I did this she starts having a seizure. Now I\\'m freaking the out. I jump out of bed and start to call an ambulance. I\\'m about to start the call and when she stops and starts making grunting noises. She\\'s giving me this wtf just happened look and I tell her what happened. At first she tells me she doesn\\'t believe me but then said that she has a history of having seizures when she gets hurt or scared. She said that when she has a seizure it\\'s best to let it take its course unless it goes on for a while. I just sat there in that \"thank god I didn\\'t finger a girl to death\" state. Needless to say our sexy time ended right there.\\n\\nTLDR: I fingered a girl into a seizure. She stops and says it happens sometimes. Happened 2 weeks ago. GF said she’d come stay at mine, but had work early the next day and didn’t have clean clothes. Obviously I was super happy and not wanting her to head home before coming over (losing valuable time with the woman I love) I reassured her that she had clothes here that she’d left previously. \\n\\nSo I went to my drawers and found her a set of clothes, and laid them out on the chair in my room. She arrived, we had a lovely evening - dinner, sex, movie, cuddles, sleeeeeeep. \\n\\nThe next morning she’s up at 06:30 and I go downstairs to make her a coffee. Bring it back upstairs and she’s standing in my room holding the sexy black panties that were part of the ensemble I laid out for her. \\n\\n“These aren’t my pants”\\n\\n“...wh.... what?”\\n\\n“These aren’t my pants...”\\n\\nI don’t really need to go on. Needless to say I died inside and visibly outside too. she left for work shaken and upset. They really weren’t her pants. \\n\\nI’ve never cheated on her, so I know they are either from a previous partner (we’ve been together 1 year) or there’s been a launderette mishap or something. But I totally understand how she felt. 2 weeks have passed and we’ve worked through it. We have a few theories, but will never truly know where they came from. \\n\\nTLDR. Gave my GF some sexy black pants to wear, thinking they were hers. They were not.\\n\\nEDIT - I’m English. When we say pants, we mean underpants. Not trousers. I’m sorry this has proved a difficult concept for so many people. I hope adding clarity to this edit will bring peace to those with troubled minds. Good night Literally right now. Was talking to a girl over text for 2-3 months. We were finally gonna meet up. I figured I\\'d be getting some action as we have been sending pics for awhile now. Now I\\'m a minute man so I was very nervous about the first time being 30sec, so I stopped by a circle k on my way to meet her. In a rush I picked the one with 5 pills in one pack and took them all... I guess ur only supposed to take one.\\nBy the time I got to her house, my heart was racing and I was very jittery. I tried to hide it as best i could. We made out a bit but nothing more, which I was glad bc I was starting to really feel weird. Idk how to describe it. As soon as I left, I got super nauseous. I pulled over and puked my guts out. So glad I left when I did. Then I drove home. I\\'m still puking. Stting on the toilet as I type this. Also, still jittery. Hoping theres nothing more to puke so I can try to go to bed\\n\\nTl;dr: took 5 times regular dose of gas station dick pills and now I\\'m puking my guts out\\n\\nTo cement my idiocy here, I thought I\\'d let everyone know that last month I became a registered nurse(☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞\\n\\nhi frontpage... guess it\\'s time to delete previous post that will identify me=I\\n\\nSome updates: a lot of people have asked if it worked. The answer is yes. I tried to rub one out at home after puking, and just cpuldnt get to climax. Also, I take my job very seriously. I know some of u are concerned, but my dick logic is confined to my personal life. I never felt like I cpuldnt function after puking. Some of u were very forgiving and supportive and I commend u for that. Very sweet of u. Also, to the guy that suggested to use \"speed base amphetamine\" I hope ur joking. Please take care of urself and get some help if ur not. Also, no I wont do it again, was joking when I said I would.\\n\\nLast update: feeling better. Only got an hour or two of sleep. Ate breakfast. Feel queasy but not throwing up. Stomach def not happy with me. Here\\'s pics of the package for all the people asking what I took and what\\'s in it.[https://i.imgur.com/APF4nSD.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/APF4nSD.jpg)[https://i.imgur.com/Pgn0tyU.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Pgn0tyU.jpg) Obligatory: did not happen today, but 13 years ago, but it also ties in to recent events.\\n\\nI lived with two roommates in a 3 bedroom apartment during college; we’ll call them Ned and Ethan. The three of us became great friends and partook in standard college debauchery, to include pranks. The most common recurring prank was laying-in-wait somewhere in the apartment with an acoustic guitar, ready to bust out Adam Sandler’s At a Medium Pace (google it) at the most unexpected time. (Everyone thinks they’re hilarious in college, I know).\\nThe most common locations for this were the living room closet, under the kitchen table, or some other common area of the apartment. But one night, my dumbass-self decided to kick it up a notch, hide in Ned’s bedroom closet, wait until he was just about to fall asleep, and then hit him with the crass sounds of Adam Sandler on my shitty Washburn 6-string. \\n\\nTrying this sort of shenanigan on a random college student would be suicide, but Ned was no random college student. Ned was the 6’3” milquetoast soft-hearted teddy bear that all the ladies loved, but none of them would date. Ned would drive 3 hours home every weekend and bring back a casserole that his parents still cooked for him. Ned never talked bad about anyone behind their back, always tried to pick up the tab at the bar, and would be sure that everyone had a sober ride home. In short, Ned was the kid that every quixotic parent wishes their angel would be when they send them off to college. So to me, that meant that whenever Ned shut his door at night, he changed into a neatly pressed set of pajamas, humbly consumed an 8oz glass of tap water, and retired to bed.\\n\\nSo I grabbed my guitar, turned off my bedroom light, shut my door (so that he’d think I had went to bed early), and snuck into Ned’s bedroom to position myself in his closet. It was a reach-in closet with the accordion doors that had the horizontal slats at a 45 degree pitch, [like this](https://cdn.instructables.com/FYA/UC2H/HMVJA37Y/FYAUC2HHMVJA37Y.MEDIUM.jpg). Ned’s bed was on opposite side of the room from the closet, so I’d have an adequate acoustic buffer beween myself and Ned, in case I accidently shifted my weight and made a subtle noise. But directly next to the closet (literally one foot of distance from myself) was Ned’s computer and desk. \\nNed came into his room for the evening, shut his door, turned off the light, and sat directly down at his computer. Due to the 45 degree angle of the closet slats, I could see the computer monitor on his desk perfectly from my head level, down to the desk level. The 12 inch proximity of Ned spiked my adrenaline, and I began to control my breathing. My back was pressed against coat hangers, and I had to diligently muffle an acoustic guitar to avoid giving away my position. Ned loaded up his email for some nightly reading, and I had convinced myself that everything was now just a waiting game. ([Artist depiction](https://i.imgur.com/XmLM5Bh.png))\\n\\nAs Ned closed his email though, my gleeful, mischievous anticipation promptly transitioned. Ned did not reach for his glass of water. Ned did not opt for the pajamas. Ned did not leave his desk. Ned reached for a box of tissues, navigated his browser to a site that specialized in anal sex of large black women, and dropped trou.\\n\\nA million regretful thoughts immediately went through my panicked brain, but it was too late. If I make myself known now, he’d be immensely embarrassed and angry that I had just violated his privacy. But if I *didn’t* speak up now, chances are I’d have to reveal myself after he was done doing the deed at some point, which means he would have rubbed one out while his roommate had a line of sight 12 inches away. So I was just stuck there, frozen, trying to remain motionless and silent, while Ned flogged the dolphin mere inches away. It felt like I was breathing down his neck while he was stroking it.\\n\\nMy hands began to cramp as I awkwardly held the guitar in a way that wouldn’t generate an ounce of noise. My legs began to jitter as I compensated for the awkward position of my back against coat hangers. Seconds turned into minutes and minutes felt like hours as I waited for him to finish, not knowing how the hell I was going to make it out of his room without him noticing.\\n\\nAfter Ned’s satisfactory groan of pleasure in tandem with a rhythmic plop-plop-plop-plop onto a Kleenex, it felt like my guilt had transitioned from a misdemeanor to a felony, and my knees were jittering so hard that I had already started rehearsing an apology in my head for when he inevitably heard a noise from his closet.\\n\\nNed promptly got into bed on the opposite side of the room, and I had started to evaluate my decision in life, and the real possibility of spending the entire damned night inside of his closet. All critical thinking had revealed zero other courses of action, until I remembered my cell phone was in my pocket. But with two hands stifling an acoustic guitar and zero room to maneuver, how would I get the phone out my pocket? Somehow I did, and I texted Ethan in the next room over:\\n\\n> foogama: In Ned’s closet. Was trying to do Medium Pace gag. Ned started wanking before I could start. Now I’m stuck in the closet and can’t get out. Need help.\\n> \\n> Ethan: LOL right.\\n> \\n> foogama: Ethan, I’m dead serious. I need you to help create a distraction for Ned so that I can gtfo of this closet and back into my room without him noticing.\\n> \\n> Ethan: …we’re going to need to have a talk later.\\n\\nRight around then our landline phone rang (yeah, they were still on the tail end of existing in 2005). It was 10:45pm on a Thursday, but I could hear Ethan answering it loudly and obviously: **“HELLO? WHY YES NED IS HERE. IS EVERYTHING OKAY? NED! NED COME HERE, PHONE FOR YOU!”** Ned rolled over in bed, and immediately took the bait. How this never raised suspicion, I’ll never know. It was a cordless phone. There was no need for Ned to walk all the way out of his room to the kitchen. But thank god he did. I bolted out of that closet and retreated back to my room and Ned was none the wiser, as he went to take a phone call that some \"stranger\" had conveniently disconnected right as he got there.\\n\\nI was forever in debt to Ethan for saving my ass, and we never told Ned. That is, of course until last weekend, 13 years later, when we were both in Ned’s wedding. There was a fun pre-wedding bachelor activity with the groomsmen where we all had to list something we “found interesting” about Ned and put it into a hat for a groomsmen to pick out of a hat. 4-beers in, I was convinced by Ethan to write “That he enjoys anal sex with large black women” because it would make a fun “bachelor story” over 10 years after the fact.\\n\\nBut of course that’s not what happened. The best man decided it would be more fun to—without warning—switch things up, and swap hats with the maid of honor, so that we’d be reading the bride’s, and they’d be reading Ned’s. And of course, there was a larger black woman as a bridesmaid on the other side of the aisle who just happened to fucking draw that out of the damn hat. I didn’t even know her name. I had actually never even met the bride until the wedding weekend.\\n\\nThe bridesmaid read it aloud, mortified, and tried to brush it off as an intentional joke, targeted at her in poor taste. Ned, however, looked like everyone in the room had just seen him naked. He immediately pulled all of his groomsmen aside, and asked us who had put that into the hat. I immediately confessed, and explained the story from 2005. Ethan and I waited for Ned to chuckle, smirk, or brush it off as a ridiculous moment in history, but apparently it was still too soon. We were both relieved of our ceremonial bible verse reading duties that day and had to go apologize to his bride and the bridesmaid.\\n\\n**tl;dr – Hid in my roommate’s closet as a prank, watched him jack off to anal porn 12 inches away, kept it a secret for over a decade, and then revealed the information to his bride’s best friends in the most awkward way possible on his wedding day.**\\n\\nI\\'ve since learned my lesson and just don\\'t hide in peoples\\' bedrooms like an idiot.\\n\\nEDIT: Thank you all for the gold, comments, and concerns for Ned. Ned is a really great guy and I\\'m sure we\\'ll be fine.\\n\\nEDIT 2: I got \"Ethan\" to create a reddit account and entertain questions.

My friend won the contest and we sat down. I started to feel a little uncomfortable. Like someone was squeezing my right nut. It didn\\'t hurt that much when I was sitting down but once I got out of the sauna and went to take a shower the pain level spiked suddenly. My vision went blurry and ears started ringing from the pain (and possibly dehydration from furiously hip thrusting in an 80 ° C sauna). I dragged myself to the kitchen and sat down. My friend brought me a glass of water and I chugged it down in one go. I told him that my testicle hurts like never before and asked if he had any painkillers. He asked me if I preferred paracetamol or ibuprofen, I said I\\'ll have both. I chewed the pills and swallowed them without water or anything, usually I require generous amounts of water but this time it was an emergency. I laid down on his bed for a while and when the pain was at a tolerable level I told him that I\\'m going to head home. I had ridden my moped there so I had to ride it home as well. It was winter and the roads were bumpy. Each bump felt like someone punched me in the ball sack but I managed to get home. Once I got home I walked  straight to my room and wet to sleep. Usually I stay up late so my mom came to see me and asked why I went to sleep so early. She was worried that I had been drinking or taken drugs so I just told her that I almost fainted and want to sleep now. In the morning when I woke up the pain had eased but my testicle was oddly shaped and still a bit sore so I rode my moped to school and went to the school nurse straight away. She examined my ball and wrote me a referral to a hospital. When I got home from school I showed the referral to my dad and he drove me to the hospital. There they took a urine sample and an ultrasound. We waited for the results and an hour later a surgeon comes almost running to me and told me that I had a testicular torsion and that we would be going to the operating room immediately. A nurse handed me hospital clothes and my dad took all my personal belongings. I changed my clothes and lied down on the hospital bed and they rushed me through the hospital to the operating room. I was put to sleep and when I woke up in the recovery ward I immediately sat up. A nurse noticed me and told me about the surgery. They tried to restore the blood flow to my testicle but it had already gone necrotic and it had to be removed. I started laughing hysterically (probably due to the medication and anesthetics). The nurse informed my parents and they came to visit me an hour later. They were shocked about my condition and asked me how I was feeling \"as a man\" but I told them that I just find it funny how one one can lose a testicle in a ball slapping contest. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR Had a hip thrusting contest with my friend to see who could clap one\\'s balls loudest, ended up losing the contest and my right testicle. I’ve been smoking weed since I went off to college ~3 years ago. I always thought weed just didn’t have that much of an effect on me other than a little tingly feeling that made me slightly less anxious than I normally am. I’ve had dozens of people tell me “oh you’re not inhaling properly” blah blah. I figured at first I probably wasn’t and had each person I smoked with teach me how to inhale properly. “Take it into your lungs” or whatever. Okay...but every time I breathe in I’m taking air into my lungs right?? So why are we acting like this is something that’s hard to do...yeah I’m a fucking idiot. So I’m watching an episode of Skins (UK) yesterday and one of the characters Effie teaches someone how to smoke.  It went something like pull it into your mouth, then breathe deeper and pull it into your lungs. Something just clicked inside my dense little fucking head and I was like OH. That makes sense.\\n\\nSo today I’m supposed to be having a boy over and I’m feeling a bit nervous so I decide to take a couple hits of my oil pen that I’ve been hitting for MONTHS. It’s an indica cart with a high ass THC concentrate but at this point I’m under the impression that I’ve built up tolerance to it. So as I hit it I try the Effie technique (the first explanation that actually made sense to my dumbass) and I coughed so hard I almost threw up. I was like oh shit...this works. So I proceed to hit it three more times like that. Biggest fucking inhales and I felt that shit SIT in my lungs. \\n\\nFML. Next thing I know I wake up in my bed but I think I’m dreaming. I close my eyes and open them again but I’m still dreaming. I do this about 8 more times until I realize holy shit I’m not dreaming I’m tripping HARD. I literally lost an hour in which I remember nothing, and when I start remembering things nothing felt real. Everything felt like a dream or a simulation. Every time I thought it was over I’d reopen my eyes and lose my shit again. At one point I was sniffing essential oils to try to bring myself back, and at another I destroyed my room looking for something I thought would “save” me (I don’t even remember what). I was convinced I had “switched frequencies” and was now on the wrong “frequency of existence” and couldn’t get back to the “right frequency.” It took me 3 fucking hours to come back to myself and realize I wasn’t going to die. During this time I called my brother, his friend, and my mom who now think I’m losing it. Also the guy that was supposed to come over thinks I’m ghosting him now. And I’m never smoking weed again.\\n\\nTL;DR: I inhaled properly when smoking for the first time, overestimated my tolerance and had the scariest trip of my life. I lost three hours during which the guy I like was waiting on me to send my address and now he thinks I’m a bitch. And now weed is ruined for me forever\\n\\nEdit: I hope it’s okay that I edit! A couple things, I went to sleep and feel a lot calmer now, I’m aware my initial post was dramatic. I did not expect to wake up to this! Also, I’m aware I’m an actual idiot for not realizing how to inhale correctly. This is why I posted in this sub, so everyone commenting or messaging me calling me all sorts of names, I know!!! I’m an idiot and all I can do is learn from my mistakes. I’d really only smoked socially before and I’ve learned a lot about smoking from this thread, so thanks to everyone that commented helpful advice! Side note, in my panic I googled what to do and one of the tips was to smell something citrus like essential oil, so that’s why I did that. I don’t remember if it helped, I think maybe for a moment it made things a little bit clearer. \\n\\nLastly, I told the guy I got “sick” and he was super understanding; we’ve rescheduled the date. I plan on telling him the whole truth in person. Thanks again to everyone giving advice or sharing similar stories! You’ve made me feel a little less stupid for this fuck up Forewarning: This is basically going to be a horny teenager story.\\n\\nAbout two years ago, after my physical exam, my doctor recommended that I go get an ultrasound on my testicles because he felt a mass. I went to go get an ultrasound and it was a young male doctor and everything was fine. So I thought I knew what to expect.\\n\\nMy parents switched insurance and now I have a different doctor. A few days ago, I went for a physical and my doctor again recommended that I go for an ultrasound. The next day, I went to go get my ultrasound and to my surprise, a young female doctor (probably a resident since she looked 27-30 years old) called my name. She introduced herself and then said, \"we\\'re a bit short-staffed so I will be doing the ultrasound today.\" My heart started racing and I was confused because I expected a male doctor since it was a checkup for my balls and didn\\'t really want to show another female my parts. Honestly, I would have been fine with an older female doctor but the issue with her was that she was very, very, VERY attractive. She was wearing a mask but she had a great face and eyes, small boobs, a slim waist, and a PHAT ass. inb4 all the comments \"I dOn\\'T sEe A pRoBlEm,\" I\\'m a virgin male teenager with helicopter parents and ever since coronavirus, I don\\'t get much privacy and probably haven\\'t jacked off in 3 weeks. Now you kinda get the idea of where this is going.\\n\\nWe get into the room and she hands me a towel and instructs me how to use the towel to fold my penis up. The way she enunciated \"penis\" made my heart race and my head pound. She leaves the room to let me undress and I use the bathroom and see that I have a half-chub. I undress, lay down on the table, and probably went through 5 iterations of how to fold the towel over my dick to hide my half-chub. I\\'m laying there for a while (probably less than a minute but it seemed like 5 minutes) and reach for my phone and decide to browse Reddit while I wait. Unfortunately, the second post I scroll to is a highly upvoted post on the facefuck subreddit and I instantly go from half chub to full-blown boner. Fantastic! My mind was racing with how to get rid of it. I eventually settle on browsing buildapcsales to try to calm myself. Suddenly... knock knock! I immediately throw my phone to the chair next to me and grab both sides of the towel to pin my boner down.\\n\\nI look down and could definitely see a bulge but think, \"maybe she\\'ll just think I have a massive flaccid dick.\" My mind wanders to porn mode as she sits down next to me and I start having absolutely ridiculous thoughts like \"holy shit! She\\'s going to blow me to help ease my nerves!\" which does not help with the boner situation at all. I\\'m trying to think of the most unhorniest thoughts ever to try to control myself.\\n\\nShe starts by putting the gel on the probe and immediately gets to it. Upon contact, I think \"Oh my god, this super hot doctor is touching my balls with a probe\" and my boner is literally pulsing under the towel. I\\'m looking at her and she\\'s mostly looking at her screen and typing so I reassure myself that she probably doesn\\'t notice. \"Perfect, she\\'s not even looking at me, I\\'ll just hold the towel down and this will be over with.\" After a bit of probing, she turns to me and says \"now I need to go up your groin area a bit so I\\'m going to fold the towel up and push everything to the side like this.\" This all happens in slow motion. I see her hand slowly reaching for the bottom corner of the towel as she gently pries the towel from my death-grip and...... BOINGGGGGG! My fully erect dick springs up and launches the towel off, fully exposing me.\\n\\nI honestly don\\'t remember her reaction. I frantically looked at her, looked at my dick, quickly grabbed the towel and wrapped up my dick like a burrito, and for the rest of the examination, I laid there with both my hands holding my erect dick back and let her finish the ultrasound. As I\\'m writing this I realize I didn\\'t even apologize to her. I was dead silent the rest of the time.\\n\\nThanks for reading my embarrassing story of the first female to see my fully erect dick. On a more serious note, I was wondering if other people who have gotten an ultrasound on their balls have also had female doctors do the ultrasound. Did you guys talk to the doctor while they were probing your balls? I\\'m honestly looking to hear more personal accounts from other people so I know what is \"normal\" and what to expect in the future if I ever have to get my balls checked out again.\\n\\nTL;DR I went to go get an ultrasound on my balls and did not expect the doctor to be a HOT female doctor. Couldn\\'t control my raging boner and accidentally exposed myself to her.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: Thank you everyone so so so so much for the reassurances, personal recounts, and in general positive responses. It makes me feel much better about what happened and what to expect when I go again. I appreciate all the LPT people telling me to flex my legs or a large muscle, I\\'ll keep that in mind for the future. It\\'s funny because she actually told me to flex my abs a few times so maybe she was looking out for me. \\n\\nTo everyone asking about my balls, my balls are fine, thanks for asking! Apparently, they are just so massive and the biggest balls they\\'ve ever seen... just playing. They actually don\\'t know what it is or what they\\'ve been feeling. Both my doctors felt something but both ultrasounds came back fine so I\\'m not sure what\\'s going on. I personally can\\'t feel anything but I\\'ve also had these balls since I was born and I haven\\'t really noticed anything out of the ordinary. \\n\\nTo everyone saying \"Two years ago...coronavirus\" and saying I don\\'t have my story straight. I apologize for the confusing timeline. Two years ago, I got the same ultrasound done but with a male doctor. I was just setting the precedent that I thought I knew what to expect. This story happened last week. I like to have some gummy bears at my desk in the morning. Because every day is a good day when you start it with gummy bears. I always offer some to anyone who happens to pass through my office. One person in our office is a vegetarian, I am aware of this. They passed by as another person and I were enjoying gummy bears, I quickly began to offer them one and then halfway through my offer I was like \"oh sorry, right! You won\\'t want these!\" \\n\\nThey responded with \"Why wouldn\\'t I?! I love gummy bears!\" I stared awkwardly for a moment before responding with \"well, they have beef gelatin in them.\" \\n\\nThem: \"what do you mean beef gelatin? Why would they use that instead of regular gelatin?\"\\n\\nMe: \"I thought all gelatin came from animals.\"\\n\\nThem: \"are you serious? You aren\\'t serious right? I love gummy bears. My kid and I eat them together all the time.\" (kid is vegetarian as well)\\n\\nMe (now panicking): \"I think I am. I don\\'t know. Maybe you\\'re right! I\\'m \\nsorry! You\\'re welcome to have some, but the label definitely specifies beef gelatin.\"\\n\\nThey now eye my gummy bears with a strange expression of disbelief, longing, anger, and disgust. I swear I could see them going through the stages of grief because I know how sad I would be if gummy bears were ruined for me. So TIFU by shattering a vegetarian\\'s blissfully ignorant love of gummy bears.\\n\\nTL;DR TIFU by informing a vegetarian who loves gummy bears that gelatin comes from animals, thus ruining gummy bears for them (and subsequently their child)\\n\\nEdit: omg. Front page. All you guys are awesome! And I\\'m learning so much! I just want to clarify a couple of items. First, this coworker of mine isn\\'t preachy at all or anything. I just happen to know their choice and respect it, I have no idea if it\\'s for health or ethical or sensory reasons or whatever. Second, my understanding is that their child chooses to also follow a vegetarian diet but is encouraged to try anything they want, so no forced vegetarianism on the child (Yay!). I\\'m excited about all the dialogue. And feeling a little drunk on the power of knowledge. But pretty please don\\'t bash my co-worker for their dietary choices because, ultimately, it is their choice :)...and they don\\'t judge me for eating candy for breakfast. Thanks Reddit world!\\n\\nEdit2: formatting (thank you to the user who showed me the way. Hopefully it\\'s a bit better now). Also, thank you for the awards!! But! It they are costing you money, please donate said money to a charity near you that feeds hungry people. Or buy a vegetarian friend a bag of vegetarian friendly gummy bears! So I’ve been seeing seeing this girl for almost 6 months now. She’s super terrific to me, and I really think things are going better than they’ve gone in my most recent relationships. We met on Tinder! I personally deleted Tinder two weeks after meeting her because I was that into her. She told me she did the same about two weeks after that. However, a recent Instagram post notified me that she had a tumblr account. Figured I’d look at it, because we had each other on other social media’s (and I was curious)\\nBIG MISTAKE\\n\\nShe’s got a substantial amount of followers and notes, but I’ve noticed all she talks about is her ex and how she’s in love with him, and other Tinder guys she’s gone on dates with. We started playing video games together recently, and I’ve just found out that her interest in them came from a guy she just spent last weekend with. \\n\\nShe has no idea I know any of this information, and I’m too into her to say anything. Please help! What do I do?\\nTL;DR Girlfriend I’m basically in love with has a Tumblr talking about her recent tinder dates and undying love for her ex and she doesn’t know I know Did you know that if you give someone a nickname on Facebook Messenger, the person you nicknamed is notified? Because I sure didn\\'t!\\n\\nI\\'m fairly good friends with this (attractive) co-worker, and we talk on Facebook Messenger pretty often. \\n\\nAbout a month ago, I stumbled upon the \"Nickname\" function in Messenger, and I thought it\\'d be fun to name him \"🍆 McBulgePants\", because of the distinct... features that I\\'ve noticed when he wears certain pants.\\n\\nHe never said anything, so I thought my fun little secret was safe, until he sent me a message today:\\n\\n\"Hey, can you name me back to [name]? I don\\'t want people to get the wrong impression\".\\n\\nOh, I should mention we\\'re both guys, he\\'s straight, and I guess this is how he found out I\\'m gay, so things have been kind of awkward.\\n\\nTL;DR came out to my coworker by accidentally highlighting his features in a nickname Obligatory this didn\\'t happen today, it happened last summer. Newly obligatory this will not end in incest. I didn\\'t accidentally eat out my cousin or half-sister or whatever dumbass erotica you\\'re all posting lately. Obligatory TL;DR at bottom.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt\\'s a perfect summer night in 2018. I\\'m leaving a job that I hate with my life, freshly broken up with, ready to throw on my leather and fuck anyone in arm\\'s reach. I turn up to my local watering hole right before 1 AM,  toss back a couple beers and post up, alone, on the outskirts of the main bar.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nLast call rings out, the bar is mobbed. I lock eyes with a moderately attractive girl (MAG) who approaches me shortly after. She\\'s equal parts drunk/horny, and does not hesitate to let me know. She\\'s celebrating a friend\\'s birthday with a squad of girls, one of whom sidles up to us and starts hitting on me hard.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMAG is totally fine with this, and the friend would land on the higher end of the BMI chart, leading me to believe I\\'m being hit with a bait and switch. They SWIFTLY disprove that theory by literally asking if I \"want both\" of them. Worth noting that this is the only time I\\'ve been anywhere near a threesome, before or since, so I jumped at the chance.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNext thing I know, we\\'re in a cab on the way back to whoever\\'s house the birthday pregame was. There is alcohol EVERYWHERE. They\\'re feeding me shots/cold buffalo chicken dip like it\\'s my last day on earth. Some girl is crying on the couch.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy drunk ass picks up the signal that an ex-boyfriend is the cause of this girl\\'s sorrow. Having been recently broken up with, I know exactly where her head is at. Having done far too many shots, I am not scared to console this crying stranger. Soon I will be the Advice Champion, and fuck every girl in the house.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI launch into my speech, hitting every point she so desperately needs to hear:\\n\\n* You\\'re so much better than him.\\n* He *OBVIOUSLY* doesn\\'t deserve you.\\n* You\\'ll look back and laugh at this in a month.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'m now starting to notice that the cheers and applause I was waiting for are actually all death stares, even a few dropped jaws. As it turns out, this girl\\'s boyfriend didn\\'t break up with her. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNo, he fucking ***DIED.***\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe guy died in a car accident and I\\'m telling her she\\'ll be laughing about it in a month. Nobody fucked anybody that night.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**TL;DR:** I was invited back to a girl\\'s house for a threesome, got very drunk and tried to console a girl crying over her ex-boyfriend that she\\'s better than him, etc. He didn\\'t break up with her, he fucking died. Here we go. This happened yesterday in university. \\n\\nSo, I wake up at 7 and I have two mid-term internal class tests from 8:30 to 9:30 and another from 9:30 to 10:30.\\n\\nI brush my teeth and take a bath and go to my room to get dressed. As I am drying myself I pick up the phone to check time and it’s only 7:20 yet and I have good 30 minutes as breakfast plus travel only takes 40 minutes from my home to university and I haven’t had a good release since a week. \\n\\nI take my phone, sit on my bed, scratch my balls while searching PornHub. I take my time and find some videos and start doing my own rhythm. I am all into it and realise I have only 5 more minutes left. I give myself the dopamine and get dressed in a hurry. \\n\\nI reach university and the examination hall is already full. Here (India) you can only take your stationary, water bottle, calculator (scientific not programmable) and your Exam Registration. I take my stuff and enter the classroom. \\n\\nThe invigilator signs me in and hands me the answer sheet and question paper. I go to my desk and as I am fumbling around for my pen, my hand senses the phone in my left pocket. I lose my shit and get all tensed up. \\n\\nI try to keep calm and switch it to Silent Mode and tell myself if I act normally I won’t get caught with it and will probably not get into any trouble. \\n\\nSoon after the Unfair Means Squad (They check if you have something to cheat) enter the class and go around checking for books or questionable stuff. I keep my head down and act like I have nothing. \\n\\nOne of the female professors lands next to me and tells me to get up. I start sweating and I almost shit my pants. She tells me to empty my pockets and I take everything out and put it on the desk.\\n\\n She stares at me and picks up my phone. \\n\\n“You seem like a studious one. Why are you cheating?” She said. \\n\\n“I am not. It’s an honest mistake.” \\n\\nThen she asks me to unlock it so that she can check if I have any PDF or Browser open and says that if she finds nothing, she’ll let me go. \\n\\nMy heart finally stops powering a jet and I place my finger over the fingerprint and it opens. \\n\\nMy heart now starts powering a rocket as I recognise the black screen with a buffer between it. The video paused.  There’s nothing on the screen though. No image or thumbnail. \\n\\n“Cheating from a video?” She says and she clicks play button on the bottom left. \\n\\nThere it is. Dani Daniels and Manuel Ferrara going at it. The sound of Dani Daniels screaming like a cat being strangled echoes through out the hall. \\n\\nThe professor dropped my phone and had a face as if I was masturbating in front of her. \\n\\nNow I have failed Computational Mathematics and have to give a written apology to the Dean of Academics and Convenor of Examination. \\n\\nAnyway, one girl who was sitting somewhere around me asked which porn was it. Had to send the link. \\n\\n\\nTL;DR : I forgot to close my porn window after masturbating. Accidentally took my phone to the examination hall where it wasn’t allowed and thr professor caught me. She checked the phone and the porn plays at full volume in the hall with 70 people sitting in it.\\n\\nEdit : \\n\\n1. For the people who think this is fake. It is not.   \\n                                                         \\n2.  For people who are saying why was I failed and now need to produce an apology one even though I wasn’t cheating - It is because in India these things are taken very seriously and even small stupid things are grounds for detention and lawful action. Also, I only need to apologise for the phone and not for the porn. \\n\\n3. The porn was Manuel Ferrara and Dani Daniels, they don’t have much together. You will easily get it with one search on PornHub. If I may suggest something much more better, please try Manuel Ferrara and The Goddess Remy LaCroix. The video starts with them talking about cup or something. That also is easily available. \\n\\n4. About the girl who asked for the link. \\n\\nI was standing outside the hall for the invigilator to take me to the office of the convenor of examination for further process and boy was she taking her time. \\n\\nThe girl must have finished her paper soon and left the hall. As she came outside she asked me why did I bring a phone to the exam and even if I did, I could have just reported it and handed it over to the invigilator and collected it after the exam. I said I could have but my I couldn’t think at that time and was afraid. \\n\\nAfter that the invigilator told me to report to the office without her. The girl accompanied me to the admin office. I accepted my fault, signed the confiscation receipt and collected my phone. \\n\\nIt was switched off so turned it on and she just casually was a peeking at it from the side. She asked to show me what was the video while giggling and I thought what the heck and showed it to her for a split second and then closed it. She started laughing and told me I am weird and then casually asked to send her the link. Then while we walked to the cafeteria, she told me she was my senior and was the co-mentor for my yearly project the previous year. She remembered my name and my Department. Then we parted ways. \\n\\nFor fuck\\'s sake, she is cute. Stop telling me to pursue her. I have another exam later. Maybe will meet her there. \\n\\n\\nThe Indian people here obviously understand why such strict action was taken against me.\\n\\nEdit 2: Man I have been reading the comments and you bastards are funny as fuck. I have bee quite depressed since a few weeks and this cheered me up good. \\n\\nThanks for whoever sent the silver and gold. I haven\\'t figured out what to do with them anyway.\\n\\nEdit 3: Invigilator is an actual word people and we use it all the time. In fact, that is the word for Exam Proctor here in India borrowed down from the time when we had a case of Britishers. \\n\\nThanks for the Gold and Silver again. Open some sort of privileged Sub-Reddits I think. It all started 23 years ago when my horny ass 13 year old self was riding his bike and stumbled across a beat up VHS tape. Upon further inspection it turned out to be a porno and I thought I hit the jackpot! The only problem is the case was broken and my VHS player didnt want to play it...FUCK! I learned a lot about VHS tapes that day and that if you are careful you can transplant that tape into the case of an advertisment VHS tape for crash bandicoot I had received because I was cool and subscribed to nintendo power. Damn Im a genius! It was fappin time and I went to town. It was the perfect hiding spot too! Nobody suspected a thing but eventually I got the internet and the VHS tapes got put in a box and forgotten about. Fast forward to now and my mom is a volunteer driver for people that need rides to the hospital. This job allows here to interact with many types of people. She meets this sweet lady that fosters kids and mentions she has a ton of old VHS tapes the kids might enjoy. 1 week after my mom gives her the tapes the lady calls my mom back and is furious. She had put the Crash Bandicoot tape on and started making dinner in the next room. Those kids learned a few new things about life that day. As you would expect my mom called me very confused and I had to akwardly explain to her how my horny adolescent ingenuity caused this to happen over 2 decades ago.\\n\\ntl;dr my adolescent self disguised porn as a video game cartoon which was accidently shown to foster kids over 2 decades later Throwaway for obvious reasons.\\n\\nSo a little background: My current gf and I have been together for about 2 months and things have been going great. Before her I was a virgin, she\\'s slept with a couple guys, not a big deal, blah blah blah. Obviously because the relationship is pretty new, we\\'re still learning about what the other likes sexually, and I\\'m learning everything for the first time. Long story short, it came up that she likes dirty talk during sex. I said I was down to give it a shot, but deep down inside I knew that I had no idea what I would be doing and would kind of be winging it. Last weekend we went out for drinks, hormones started flying, and we decided it was time to wrap the night up, so we went back to her place. So we\\'re getting it on, drunkenly fumbling and slobbering, but we\\'re wasted so it\\'s fine. She\\'s telling me about how wet she is and all the things she wants me to do to her...all the nasty stuff.\\nShe kind of rambled for a bit, and I was feeling a bit of pressure to chime in, because surely she\\'d run out of material soon. The rum is swooshing through my veins at this point, making me feel much more comfortable than I normally do. This is all new territory for me, but I\\'m feeling adventurous tonight, a bit like Christopher Columbus, and she\\'s what I think is India. So I decide to talk dirty. Her monologue was cycling back to her being wet, and like a hungry cheetah, I figure this is the perfect time to strike. And that\\'s when I cleverly decided to ask if I make her \"moister than an oyster\". \\n\\nHer face fell. It\\'s hard to describe the mixture of despair and drunken hopelessness that spilled across her face. I went from being a cunning cheetah pouncing on a wounded antelope, to being a cheetah that tried pouncing but tripped over a log and broke its neck in the process. I\\'ve been wondering how I could have fucked up such an easy moment, but nothing can explain it. We approach this next weekend, and we\\'ve talked twice since then. I don\\'t think I\\'ll be redeeming myself anytime soon. \\n\\nTLDR: I decided to be sexy and asked my gf if I made her moister than an oyster. She doesn\\'t think oysters are sexy. Holy shit Reddit, get off my ass because this is a real bummer. ;)\\n\\n This happened two weeks ago, I’ve just left hospital but have to spend the next three months (at least) on my stomach in bed. I’m planning on using that time to ~~learn a new language~~ look at memes. \\n\\n**Marked NSFW because I’ll link a photo of the burn on my ass in my tl:dr below.**\\n\\nI’ve been a paraplegic since a military accident in 2004. I’ve always lived independently and taken very good care of myself and my ass because sitting-pressure plus lack of sensation, and decreased blood flow in paralysed areas can cause pressure sores that never heal, and I like to be as active as possible. \\n\\nSo I check my skin every day with a mirror or phone camera (belfie), change position, lift myself to allow blood flow etc. I spent a lot of time in hospital following my initial injury and saw guys living with open weaping sores that never heal, it terrified me (search for “pressure sore paraplegic” if you enjoy being disgusted) and I’m proud to say I’ve never had a pressure sore because I’m so careful, despite skiing, kayaking, and even paragliding still. \\n\\nBasically I’m a dumbass with a numbass, but I look after it... normally. \\n\\nI had an *open-book* pelvic fracture when I was hurt back in 2004, and quite a few other problems at the same time so they put me back together in a bit of a rush whilst idk ... resuscitating me and stuff. My pelvis is now tilted down to one side, when I sit it’s considerably lower and bears all the weight. The leg on that side looks 3 inches longer than the other. \\n\\nAs I sat in my car for a three-hour drive home that side of my pelvis must have been pushing directly onto the heated element within the seat. Even though it wasn’t hot enough to burn immediately, I suffered a “low-heat” burn after three hours. Which is *way* worse than it sounds. \\n\\nI could feel the heat on my lumbar region and never thought it would be able to burn me, I even turned the heat to the low setting to be careful. \\n\\nThat night I checked my skin and found my worst nightmare.  Which got worse. What initially looked superficial developed a softball sized blister overnight that burst to show something looking like an effect from the walking dead. \\n\\nTwo weeks later and the first layers of dead tissue are starting to lift, the skin is healing. Now I just have to worry about osteomyelitis. \\n\\n\\n**TL;DR** An injury 15 years ago messed up my pelvis so badly that when I drive it pushes directly into a heating element in my new car’s seats. A three hour long drive burned my ass as a result (possibly bone) and I’ll be spending 3 months it so laying on my stomach while it heals. \\n\\nNSFW link to pics of my skinny, burnt ass:\\n\\n24hrs later right after the blister burst:\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/DE5eh17\\n\\nTwo weeks later with healing and necrosis:\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/bvOJYBP\\n\\n*Edit:* The bum burning car is a **2019 Ford Focus Active X**, UK model. \\n\\nI’m sorry some of you clicked the pic links expecting to see a girl’s ass but feel that’s a lesson you needed to learn. I’m happy so many people have seen my ass though, am I a “thot” now? Okay, granted this actually happened around 23 years ago, I just remembered it this morning. \\n\\nWhen I was around five I made this new friend, let\\'s call him Tim, who had the coolest stuff. I would go to his house to play and we were becoming pretty good friends. His house was awesome. His dad had a sweet computer we could use with games, and he just happened to have this HUGE glass container filled with some really dope marbles. \\n\\nSo one day we bust out the marbles and start rolling them into each other, as you do, and everything is going normally. Just two normal kids playing with marbles. We were playing with a whole set of different colours, patterns and sizes. There were gigantic ones and tiny little ones. Unfortunately the marbles began to induce a kind of childlike creativity they didn\\'t deserve. \\n\\nTo us, being five year olds in the late 90s, asses and toilet humour were some of the funniest things you could conceive. Somehow a connection was made between those smooth-ass marbles and our smooth-ass asses. A simple connection but one that would come with repercussions. \\n\\nAn idea was conceptulised and there was no turning around. We thought it would be hilarious to put a marble right up inside one of our tiny little asses. \\n\\nThankfully it wasn\\'t mine... \\n\\nAfter much of a struggle Tim managed to squeeze a small marble into himself and upon realising it wouldn\\'t come back out, began bawling his eyes out, having to be driven to the hospital by his mum to have the said marble removed from his anus. \\n\\nNeedless to say, I got in a LOT of shit. I was banned from ever going around to Tim\\'s house again and I don\\'t remember ever seeing him again to be honest.\\n\\nTL;DR: Today (around 23 years ago) I lost a friend, and my friend lost a marble So I just started in this company a few weeks back. I\\'m your typical shy person that in the first few weeks doesn\\'t say much and really needs some time to get comfortable with the new situation and new people. Starting this job it was no different.\\n\\nNow, a few weeks later I\\'m starting to feel comfortable around everyone and also starting to make jokes and joining non-work related discussions between co-workers. Somehow we landed on the topic of old diseases that nowadays barely occur. My manager named a few and I said that the ones she mentioned actually still exist in other less developed parts of the world.\\n\\nThen I jokingly said, \\'And nowadays you don\\'t know, with the rise of brain dead anti-vaxx moms we might be again introduced to all kinds of weird and ancient diseases.\\' ...\\n\\nMy co-workers all cracked a laugh, but the look on my managers face said it all and there was instant regret from my side. She raised her voice and started firing questions asking  anti-vaxx moms are brain dead, rambling about the vaccines being the cause of autism and the pharma industry is trying to control the mind and body of her coming baby. It was one blasting tirade, about how she is woke and shit.\\n\\nI guess the coming year will be one really interesting one for me.\\n\\n**TL:DR** Joked about anti-vaxx moms in front of my manager who is pregnant, and apparently supports the anti-vaxx movement. Tension on the workplace ever since have been, so to call, quite high.  I am on a work trip that will last about 3.5 months. At this time, I will be away from my wife and we will both be not having sex until i come home (sometime in December). It is also important to state that I have some heart issues and am currently on blood thinners.\\n\\nI want to prep to have some mind blowing sex when I come home, so I have been \"training\" to hold my orgasm.\\n\\nOver the weekend i had to make a long drive and didn\\'t have time to give it a wank. Today was the first time since thursday (4 days) with no wank.\\n\\nI went to the bathroom to do the deed and decided to lay in the filled tub while doing it.\\n\\nAfter edging for 55 minutes, I crossed the point of no return. I could feel an immense pressure build up, and I inadvertently aimed my rifle at myself.\\n\\n The pressure from no wanks and the edging turned my first part of the load into a mach 1 projectile. This projectile shot right to my eye, and I literally gave myself a facial. But then it got worse - my eye started burning and I could feel my contact fold into my eye lid.\\n\\nI panicked to get out of the tub to a towel, and ended up slipping on the tile and whacking my head on the edge of the tub. The next moment I am laying on the ground, dried cum on my face and eye, and something sticky on my head.\\n\\nFrom whacking my head on the tub, i cracked my head open and there was blood everywhere. I could still feel the blood wet on the back of my head and I felt sticky all over. Then suddenly I was getting very dizzy. I crawled out of my room and pounded on my door asking for help.\\n\\nNext time I woke up, I was in an ambulance heading to the hospital. One of the service maids heard me pounding on the door and opened the door to see me naked and covered in blood and she called 911 (according to the EMTs).\\n\\nThe EMT said I was lucky I made it to the door, since I was losing alot of blood still (there was a small pool by the door). He also said he \"cleaned up the blood and other secretions from my face.\"\\n\\nSo here I am, leaving the hospital, knowing that the hotel staff and paramedics saw me covered in blood after giving myself a facial.\\n\\nTLDR: edged too hard, rubbed it out, blasted eye with cum and slipped on tile floor trying to get a towel.hit head and almost died of blood loss due to blood thinners.\\n\\nSorry if this is ramble-y, I am very much so mentally lost from the crazy ride today.\\n\\nEDIT #1: hey guys, I talked to my boss and he is sending someone out to relieve me from work for a month. I was told to work remotely at home while I rest and recover. \\n\\nTo the people asking for pictures of my head, I\\'ll have my wife take pictures when I am home. I am actually worried she will see this post and connect the dots as she is a redditor (but does not frequent this subreddit) and I didn\\'t expect this to blow up. But I like to live dangerously, so the show will go on. *Some kid on TikTok stole my story - no it’s not me - Ive called him out*\\n\\nObligatory didn’t happen today - happened in 2000. I was 12. My mom was annoyed at my brother (2.5 yrs younger than me) for some reason and me being ever helpful decided that I would take care of the situation, so for Mother’s Day I decided the best course of action would be to just get rid of him.\\n\\nI posted my brother on eBay &amp; after a few days and several bids I managed to sell him to someone in Taiwan for $17.\\n\\nDon’t ask me how in the hell I managed to do this and not get it taken down - looking back I can’t make sense of it.\\n\\nSo once I sold him I then was faced with a thought that hadn’t crossed my 12 year old mind - how am I going to ship him?? So I ignored it because according to the internet what I did was illegal. And what better way to make something go away than to just ignore it?\\n\\n2 weeks later I’m thinking I’m in the clear because I just stopped getting on eBay and again my 12 year old brain thinks nobody knows me and I’ll never have to think about this again (what’s an IP address?!) until my family and I are eating dinner and there’s a knock at the front door. I instantly got nervous because nobody uses that door so it must be serious or someone we don’t know.\\n\\nMy dad comes back into the kitchen a few minutes later and tells my brother to go to his room.. and for me to follow my dad. I walk into the family room to have a seat in front of two state police and the states version of FBI.\\n\\neBay reported me to the state police &amp; my IP address was acquired - they were not however expecting a 12 year old girl to walk into the room as their culprit.\\n\\nI got a slap on the wrist &amp; a formal ban from eBay until I was 18 - and a very very long talk from the feds about what I had done.\\n\\nEDIT: this seems to cause some confusion - when I say FEDs, it was the states computer crime task force (federally funded department)\\n\\nEDIT 2: I fessed up immediately- my parents were questioned of course but I showed the computer crimes people what I did & took full responsibility.\\n\\nTL;DR when I was 12 I sold little brother on eBay, didn’t know how to ship him. Ignored it. FEDs showed up &amp; got banned from eBay. I\\'m a dude. I got a little carried away with personal grooming time. My usual mindset is along the lines of \"trim the grass but don\\'t scorch the earth,\" and I\\'m not really into body shaving. But I had the brilliant idea that maybe a non-hairy butt might be something nice to explore, so on a whim, I decided to give it a go.\\n\\nI failed to take into consideration what a massive undertaking this would turn out to be. Even if you\\'re normal-sized, your butt is bigger than you think. It\\'s not like shaving your face, where there\\'s a relatively small amount of surface that needs actual shaving. A butt represents a decent-sized parcel of real estate. And even if you\\'re not super hairy, the hair is probably widespread, which means you probably have to shave the whole thing.\\n\\nWith my face, I get maybe two or three swipes of the razor before I have to rinse off the blade. With my butt, as it turns out, I get about half a swipe before the razor is full. And I mean full in a \"rinse it off, oops that didn\\'t work, I guess I\\'m going to have to swipe backward against a washcloth or towel and then rinse it off some more\" kind of a way. I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m going to have to throw out this washcloth because even after washing it, it still has the appearance of my grandparents\\' shag carpet.\\n\\nAlso, even if you\\'re flexible, your butt\\'s kind of difficultly positioned and awkward to reach. I had to keep reminding myself which way I was going, and at some point, I developed a very real fear that I was accidentally going to do a sideways swipe instead of a vertical swipe, which would disastrous for obvious reasons.\\n\\nThen, at some point, you have to make a decision: Am I only shaving the outside? Or do I go, uh, between the pages? In my ongoing brilliance, I decided that shaving just the outer cheeks would only serve to make the inside appear that much hairier, so I parted the fold and continued inward. This, it turns out, is a different undertaking altogether. Skin that never sees the light of day is, understandably, much more sensitive. Also, by this time I was sweating from nervousness, and it helps nothing to also now have the potential for losing my grip on the razor.\\n\\nIt took probably 45 minutes altogether, and by the time I finished this somewhat harrowing project, I was feeling pretty accomplished.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t done, however, with my string of bad decisions. Aftershave was a terrible, horrible idea. I only had a minute or two of enjoying my nice, smooth butt before I decided something along the lines of, \"Now let\\'s make this smooth skin feel like someone set it on fire.\" It took a solid half-hour for the burning sensation to subside. And by then, there was no real enjoyment over my achievement, just a relief that my ass no longer felt ablaze.\\n\\nAnd that brings us to the final experience, which is the ongoing consequence of this particular grooming experiment. You know how each of us sort of learns the best way to position yourself so you can stifle a fart? Shaving your butt changes all of that drastically. You will never fart quietly with a shaved butt, and I do mean never. About an hour or so after I had finished, I dropped a normal-sized fart without really thinking about it. The sound visibly startled me. It was like someone fired a machine gun in an echo chamber. Anyone within earshot will clearly hear the unmistakable sound of your butt cheeks slapping against each other. And without hair to provide an easy exit, you will feel the little gas bubbles as they slowly work their way up your butt crack, like the carbonation bubbles on a Sprite that you\\'ve poured into a glass. Every fart since then has been a very similar experience, and I now suspect this will continue until the hair grows back.\\n\\nI guess it was worth doing in the sense of, \"Well, now I know what that\\'s like.\" But I can\\'t say I recommend the experience, and I\\'m certainly never planning to do it again.\\n\\nTL;DR Shaved my butt. Was difficult. Used aftershave, which set my ass on fire. Can never fart silently again.\\n\\nEdit: To those of you sending me private messages, I am 100% not going to send you a photo of my butt. I\\'m flattered, but it\\'s not happening. Not even for \"science\" or for \"education.\" My story in text form is as far as I\\'m willing to go. You all are hilarious, though!\\n\\nEdit 2: Thank you for the gold, kind stranger!\\n\\nFinal Edit: I can\\'t even begin to thank you all for the ridiculous amount of awards, comments, messages, and hilarity. This has been the highlight of my 7 years on Reddit. You all are the best! This actually happened about 10 years ago and we split up because of it. Before I go any further I want to point out that I am fully aware of how shitty and inexcusable cheating is. I was young and made a mistake that I paid for immediately. This is my story.\\n\\nSo one night my room mate invited me (21 years old at the time) to the beach to see a bunch of people that we knew from high school and hadn\\'t seen since graduation. We had spent all night in the bar drinking and taking shots. Eventually the bar closes so me, my room mate and the remaining members of our group decided to grab the coolers from our friends hotel and head towards the water to finish the night off with a few more beers and listen to the water. The waves seemed to be appearing from a void. This is about the time things took a turn.\\n\\nWe had been debating getting in the water, but this is not very smart at night especially when you don\\'t know the schedule of the tide, plus we were absolutely shit faced. I was the first one to start heading that way, removing my clothes down to my underwear, when one of the girls we were with sprints past me. I turn around and everyone is naked. I admit that at this point I had not even considered how my girlfriend would have felt about this, and I got naked too. We had been swimming for about 30 minutes when everyone started splitting up. This was during low tide so you could go quite a ways away from shore and still be waist deep. I had come up to a sandbar with this girl that I had been friends with for years. Neither of us had even realized how far away we had strayed from the group or the shore. This is the moment I cheated. About halfway through the deed I heard my room mate screaming our names at the top of his lungs. We were the only ones left out there and the tide was coming in. We made it only a few feet from the sandbar when I noticed what looked like fireflies in the water. I quickly realized that these were jellyfish and they were EVERYWHERE! We both frantically tried to hurry through but they just kept coming. There were at least 50-75 that we could see. Suddenly I felt a sharp sting across the back of both knees. I grabbed my friend by the wrist and started to pull her as I did my best to run because now shit had gotten serious. I made the one mistake that every beach goer knows better than to do. I decided we needed to get out immediately and climbing the rocks would help. I didn\\'t even get a single foot planted because my toe was immediately sliced open to the bone by a clam. Now I\\'m naked, pouring blood, and both of us had been stung all over. We started back towards the beach when I was doubled over in pain shooting through my penis and balls. I thought I had been bitten by something, but it turns out a jellyfish had wrapped around my genitals. I had never been in pain like this before. When we finally got to the beach we were surrounded by all of our friends who heard us screaming and had called the police because they thought we had come across a shark. It\\'s now almost 5 am and the experience had completely sobered me up. The police were surprisingly cool about the whole situation and one of them offered to walk us back to the hotel.\\n\\nFast forward to later in the morning when my room mate had driven us home. When we got home I started evaluating my injuries, I definitely needed stitches, but opted out because I didn\\'t have insurance at the time. My penis looked horrendous however. I couldn\\'t even believe what this jelly fish had done to it. It was swollen, tender and was a different shape. I took a handful or Ibuprofen and took a shower before passing out for the remainder of the day until the evening when I wake up to my girlfriend crawling in the bed with me. My heart sank. She knew I had gone out the night before, and my room mate informed her of my rough night excluding the fact that I betrayed her. She was there for maybe a total of 10 minutes before I completely broke down and confessed, but did not tell her about the cut or the jelly fish. She never looked at me, never cried and left without saying anything. I saw her about 4 years ago in a bar. She approached me and asked if we could talk for a while. She told me that she was never mad at me and that after some time she was just happy I was honest (after the fact she noted). To which I replied, \"well I\\'ve got something else to tell you about that night that you\\'re going to love.\" She fucking loved every second of hearing the rest of the events from that night. We laughed pretty hard about it. I paid for her tab and left. We haven\\'t spoken since.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR I cheated on a very good girl and was stung on the dick by a jelly fish immediately after. So I just got off the phone with the police because a week and a half ago I was chatting with a girl on reddit. Eventually we exchanged instagram accounts after which she asked if I wanted to have video sex on hangouts. She\\'s a pretty girl and we had a good time. Or so I thought...\\n\\nThis afternoon I received a message from her saying she recorded everything and she wants me to pay €500 or else she\\'d send the video to all my contacts. I\\'m not the guy to start to panic so I called the police for advice. They told me to block her so that she can\\'t send me threats anymore so that\\'s what I did. I came up with the idea to post on my social media that if anyone receives a video of me to not open it because I am being blackmailed.\\n\\nBut to do that I first had to inform my parents. So i\\'m calling my mom. She says i\\'m very dumb but she appreciates me informing her. She then passes the phone to my father so I can explain myself to him. He asks if i\\'m just naked on the video, or if i\\'m performing any \"actions\" to which I respons; well yeah, i\\'m beating my meat of course.\\n\\nSo now i\\'m waiting for someone to tell me that they received a video of me masturbating while having to explain myself to everyone who is concerned for me because of my post.\\n\\ntldr; had video sex with a stranger, am now being blackmailed. I\\'ve had to tell my father that I\\'m choking my chicken on the video.\\n\\nEDIT: a lot of people are asking me how she got my contacts; she copied a list of all my followers on instagram. She also showed me proof of the recording. And for an update: no video has reached me or my friends yet.\\n\\nEDIT2: I can\\'t keep up with the comments anymore. A lot of people are telling me their stories of how they got blackmailed. We\\'re all a bunch of horny idiots, aren\\'t we? I wish all the best luck to anyone who is or has been in a similar situation. Stay safe kids Obligatory, this happened a few years ago and kinda a funny story to look back on now.\\n\\nSo I used to work in film and TV production. Just graduated college and finally got a shot to work as a production assistant on Spiderman: Homecoming. My first union run set.\\n\\nDidn’t, and still do t care about MCU movies, nor did I really follow who was acting in them at all. At this time, during shooting Tom Holland was pretty new to the role and the only thing I think he was in that people heard about was Civil War which I hadn’t seen.\\n\\nMy boss, told me that I had to watch the food spread for any extras coming in and direct them to a different food spread, as extras weren’t allowed to have the main spread. This may sound kind of rude to do but this is pretty typical if you have a lot of extras because it would take too much time for everyone to get a plate and eat so they divide it up.\\n\\nAnyway, it was right before break and my boss told me as I was waiting for the cast and crew to arrive I can get my food and wait around. So I did. While getting food I noticed a black cadillac pulling up (should have been my first clue) and a few people getting out, Tom being one of them. Again, still didn’t know who he was so I just thought he was maybe an extra. \\n\\nTom is a super nice kid, came right up to me in line and started talking to me asking me how I was doing and all that. As we were making small talk I interrupted him and said “I don’t mean to interrupt, buy you by chance wouldn’t happen to be an extra are you?”. His face looked really confused and I looks like he thought I was joking, all he said was, “No, I play spiderman?”\\n\\nMy stomach dropped, all I could think of in my head was my first big set and i mistaken the lead actor for an extra. I apologized to him and told him that I didn’t know who was playing spiderman at all nor did I ever watch the movies before. He laughed and said it was okay. Bs’ed with him for a couple minutes after until he had to go back to his trailer. I was happy that he took it as well as he did, was really cool to meet him too, but was so incredibly embarrassing.\\n\\nTL;DR\\nI had to make sure no extras went to the food table on Spiderman: Homecoming, with no prior knowledge of who was playing Spiderman. Tom got food next to me and asked him if he was an extra.\\n\\nEDIT:\\nI should of put this in the post originally but didn’t think it was relevant at all, but i’m seeing people comment the same thing. On big sets like this, typically what happens is that production changes the name of the film, in this case the film was called Summer of George, this is for anonymity among outsiders so we don’t attract a crowd. This goes for the same thing with the casts names in the call sheet, it’s usually abbreviated. When I got the call sheet the night before all I had gotten was where, what time PAs were supposed to be. Didn’t even know it was a MCU movie until I signed my contract. Figured it out today, but have been fucking up for 3 weeks. \\n\\nBf started chemo and has been very fortunate to be feeling pretty ok. So our sex life has stayed at our normal level. Probably even more active since, well, he\\'s terminal. \\n\\nI\\'ve been having horrible nausea and headaches. I already have anxiety so I figured I\\'m just a mess over the cancer, kids, job stress, etc. and making myself sick. \\n\\nThis morning I woke up queasy again and joked about having sympathy chemo symptoms. I Google, and no that\\'s not a thing, but secondhand chemo exposure is...through bodily fluids. Symptoms include nausea and headaches. And the periods of me feeling bad line up perfectly to his treatments. \\n\\nI\\'ve been letting my dude nut poison in me folks. \\n\\nYou\\'re supposed to use condoms for several days after chemo and also not swap a bunch of spit. Now that I know this it seems SUPER OBVIOUS. But uh, guess I was too horny to think it through.\\n\\nTL;DR did dirty deeds with my bf\\'s chemo dick and got sick from it\\n\\nETA: Thanks for all the well wishes and debates on my stupidity. \\n\\nTo answer as many questions as I can and also because I feel mildly defensive: He is stage 4, with literal dozens of bone mets. There is no cure but no timeline either. We probably have a few more years. He is in EXCELLENT care at a renowned university program. We adore his team. I\\'ve been at every appointment, taken notes, blah blah. This was not reviewed with us, only side effects. The separate bathroom/ wear gloves thing was reviewed with the couple next to us and we even wondered aloud what kind of scary chemo they were getting. We didnt read the pamphlet because this ain\\'t his first chemo rodeo. But it is mine. So all of us, including his care team, let it slip through the cracks. We\\'re only in our 30s but our best guess is they figured he\\'d be too weak for sex. Or they just forgot. Or they figured we\\'d read the info. Shit happens. \\n\\nEdit 2: please stop hitting on me in my DMs, jesus fucking christ  A couple of things worth knowing before we continue. My partner is a farmer and we get up at 4am every morning. We also live in an old wood house up a mountain.\\n\\nOk so this happened this me this morning. \\n\\nWe woke up as usual and I went to put on the coffee machine, which we set up the night before because 4am is a ridiculous time to try and do anything\\n\\nWhile the coffee was brewing I absent mindedly began to clear the sink from the night before. We are pretty lazy at night so all the dishes etc just get soaked.\\n\\nSo in my 4am haze I\\'m fishing about in the sink trying to clear out the rice from yesterdays meal so the water will go down. I grab what I assume to be a tea bag and go to put it in the bin. But of course, before I can do that I have to squeeze the liquid out as i dont want shitty water in the bottom of the bin.\\n\\n\\nHere\\'s the fuck up incase you didnt see it coming. The \\'teabag\\' is a dead mouse that has drowned overnight and become waterlogged and swollen. I squeeze the mouse and it explodes, covering my face with it\\'s awful pink water/viscera.\\n\\nNo idea why my mouth was open at the time apart from it was 4am and I was probably mouth breathing and half asleep still.\\n\\nIt tastes like pennies and sadness. I may never be the same again.\\n\\nTL;DR I exploded a mouse thinking it was a teabag and drank its divine juices, which I assume shot out of its waterlogged anus.\\n\\nEDIT: thanks to everyone contacting me to tell me to seek medical advice. I have and have a follow up appointment next week. I\\'m glad my fuck up could turn so many stomachs TIFU by cumming in my pants while my mom showed me a picture of Jesus.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI\\'m a \"man\" of 21 living with my relatively conservative and religious parents while I go to college. My parent\\'s house is a one story, cheaply built house. This means that the walls are PAPER thin, you can pretty much hear any normal volume conversation from anywhere in the house with pretty great clarity.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIn my case, doing the business isn\\'t a loud activity so I don\\'t have to worry about timing my strokes with the whir of the AC unit to mask the sound. I more have to worry about the activity level of those around me; as it is frequent where my parents will come to my room to talk or ask me to do tasks.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWith that being said. I have been caught off guard quite a lot and I have my lock down protocol in place to lower suspicion and avoid getting caught. One of the tactics of this \\'lock down protocol\\' includes the time it takes me to answer a knock on my door. This consequently, is also the fatal flaw that now has me recounting the traumatic events of today. I figure that the quicker that I answer a knock with \\'come in\\' the less suspicion I draw. I personally feel that if I were to yell \\'hold on\\' and take like 10 seconds to hide the evidence, I would be raising the level of suspicion.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNow, some may think that the tactic of answering as quick as possible is dumb. However, I have a little hallway inside of my room which is about 3 feet from the entrance of my door to my bed cutting off line of sight to anyone who even fully steps into my room. For the most part, my family never fully walks into my room past the hallway because they know that sound travels and that they don\\'t have to make eye contact with me to get whatever they have to say across. However, tonight, my mom, who has gotten into painting during the quarantine, had a new piece of art to show me.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo it\\'s about 7pm and I can hear that my parents are in the living room down the hall watching their favorite TV shows, which they do for an hour or so every night after dinner. So I figure that now is as good a time as any to \\'get busy\\' since I wouldn\\'t be interrupted.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI was wrong. No one was watching the TV, and my mom was in her office right next to my room scribbling away at our messiah.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe folly of my judgement became clear as day when I heard a knock at the door just as I had past the point of no return. I scrambled to hide the evidence as the words \\'come in\\' left my mouth. As I pulled my pants up, my mom turned the corner with a freshly painted picture of Jesus fucking Christ holding the hand of a little girl whilst they strolled down a dirt path in a meadow. I stood there looking into the eyes of Jesus while my mistake soaked my inner leg and sock.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBut at that moment I realized that this was only the beginning of my problems. I began to wonder why, in such a dark room, I was able to see the face of our lord and savior so clearly. It was then that I realized that in my rush to save what pride I had left, I had pulled my phone by my earbuds on to the floor, showing in glorious 1080p HD what could only be described of as SIN. I rush to put my soaked foot over the screen to possibly save myself from the eyes of the lord.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWith the lack of reaction from my mom, I figured that she hadn\\'t seen what was on my phone, only fixated on my reaction to her new creation.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI try to pick up my phone, mashing buttons on the sides hoping to find the power button to turn it off. Unfortunately, at the same time, I was trying to disconnect my earbuds to put my phone into my pocket as quick as possible. The combination of both frantic actions lead to the high decibel release of pain and pleasure that filled the room and serenaded the ears of my poor mother with the sounds of some woman being ass-blasted by a well endowed gentleman. My mom exits the room with not another word spoken.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt has been 2 hours and the house has fallen silent. I fear that my time in this house has come to an end. I will live the rest of my life wandering the streets, homeless, hoping one day to repent for my sins.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR : I was masturbating and about to cum when a knock at the door from my mom had me rushing to be presentable. I came in my pants while looking at a picture of Jesus that she had painted while porn blared from my speakers, causing an awkward moment in the universe.\\n\\nGeneralized update and edit:\\n\\nIt\\'s the next day. I\\'ve crossed paths with my mom a few times and shes been kind of quiet. She doesn\\'t seem too cross, so I\\'m gonna stay under the radar and ride it out the best I can. My parents have really mellowed with age and I feel that this may have been just more awkward than \"wrong\" and time will probably alleviate the tension\\n\\nI\\'ve read through some of the comments and I would like to thank you guys for the humorous and light-hearted responses. Really helps take some of the anxiety out of the situation.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI would like to address some other types of questions to give a better understanding of my situation\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\- I don\\'t have a lock to my door. And I couldn\\'t get one.\\n\\nMy parent\\'s theory on door locks is \"If you\\'re doing something that requires a locked door, then you probably shouldn\\'t be doing it\"\\n\\n\\\\- Yes I know I should have done it in the bathroom. And yes, I should have done it when no one was awake\\n\\nHowever, as the title suggests \"Today I Fucked UP\" I fucked up everything for this situation. From my conditioning to respond to door knocks the way I do, to my inability for self control sometimes.\\n\\n\\\\-The Phone\\n\\nI know that video players across all modern phones pause the video when an audio device is connected or disconnected. However, on the website that I was using (xfantasy), touching anywhere on the screen plays and pauses the video. In my anxiety riddled, fat fingered attempt to hide the phone, a brush against the screen was bound to happen.\\n\\n\\\\-It\\'s fake\\n\\nEverything is fake. Nothing could ever be real. You\\'re just living in a simulation that is tailor made to anger you by filling Reddit with \"creative writing\" papers. What horrors it must be that you alone have to endure such torture, to be exposed to such inhumanities. Thank you so much for being the one to decipher the falsities of our universe. If only my programmer overlords who made this simulation could have made me in your image to be a truth seeker, what a life that would be /s\\n\\n&#x200B; Going to bed yesterday, in the dark, something stung my foot as I slipped under the covers.  As I sat up and reached for the light, it stung my other leg, then moved up to my thigh and stung again.  Lights on now, I reached down and began swatting at it and attempting to swipe it away from my with my hand.  Each time I tried to find the culprit, it would viciously sting my hand.  I discovered that it was hard and at least a couple of inches long- I was thinking scorpion or one of those giant man eating bees invading the northwest.  Three stings on the hand and I had located it- it was under the sheet.  Two more stings as I attempted to kill it while it was still trapped.  Finally and reluctantly, I pulled back the sheet, ready to deal with whatever monstrosity escaped.  It was a damned sewing needle, sticking halfway out of the mattress- and I’d been repeatedly stabbing myself with it.\\n\\nTLDR; Mistook a sewing needle in my mattress for a stinging insect.  Repeatedly stabbed myself trying to swat it away with my hand. Obligatory just over a week ago comment. So I have been moved in with my boyfriend three weeks - it was quite sudden as we’ve only been together three months. And also somewhat poorly planned as one of us has a cat...and the other has a tiny parrot who genuinely believes he is a velociraptor. \\n\\nRagebeak belongs to me. It is a Saturday morning, and he has commenced the daily scream at about seven - not too early and not too late but definitely too loud. Still, I thought being a Saturday I’d take him downstairs and cuddle/play and let my boyfriend lie in.\\n\\nI fell down the stairs. Still holding very small parrot and my first thought was OH GOD DONT CRUSH HIM so I threw my hands up like I just didn’t care and...\\n\\nI broke my back.\\n\\nAnd then when I finally got somewhat upright and attempted to go back up the stairs (parrot is stood a few steps up completely fucking baffled by my behaviour but importantly he is neither flat or dead) I passed out from the pain, hit my head off the counter and sustained a head injury. \\n\\nWoke up a bit later laid on the floor dribbling and attempted round two significantly more successfully and went to go shriek about ambulances at my boyfriend - because as it happens he sleeps like THE DEAD and heard none of the screaming/clattering/slamming noises.\\n\\nTL;DR removed parrot from bedroom so my boyfriend could have a sleep in, broke spine and woke him up with screaming of my own. Right in his face.\\n\\nEDIT - thank you all for your concern, the spinal cord itself is fine so I’m not paralyzed and there shouldn’t be any life-ruining effects. I’m just on bed rest and LOTS of pain medication!\\n\\nThanks for the silver! And gold! AND THE POO! And all your lovely comments/well wishes/ recommendations :)\\n\\n[the idiot in question](https://imgur.com/gallery/doRluCr) So setting the scene, finished my last final, tired as shit. So, what do I do go to a bar. There i am chilling and this guy buys me a drink we chat and we hit it off hes really cool hes from my home town and we just really relate to each other really well.\\n\\n\\nFast forward and were fucked hardly holding our shit together, being somewhat responsible we leave and call an uber. We went to his apartment and chilled and watched netflix and whatnot until we made a bet on some weird shit. I dont remember what it was on but if he won he would get a titjob and if I won he would get Graham crackers and icing from the store and we would make those Graham cracker Christmas houses, yes it was Spring, yes we were wasted.\\n\\n\\nSo the outcome had us in bed with me lying on my back holding my tits together and him on my chest thrusting between my tits. The liquor probably helped a lot but I thought it was hot as fuck. He starts moaning and groaning a whole lot more and I close my eyes and he cums on my face and chest. Not a second later I hear a girl screeching. It scares the shot out of me so I scream and open my eyes and instantly get cum in my left eye. The guy starts laughing his ass off, his girlfriend/ wife starts crying while still screaming and I\\'m still laying down and I cant see shit. She runs out of the house and the guy grabs a pair of pants and runs after her. \\n\\n\\nI dont really know what I was supposed to do so I just kind of took a shower and left. Their shower was really nice though. It was really tall and open and kind of looked like the top of a lighthouse.\\n\\n\\nOverall\\nGuys looks: 8/10 Nice beard\\n\\nSex: 9.4/10 Nice and steamy \\n\\nCum in eye: ß Gritty?\\n\\nShower: 10/10 Really cool\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: Got drunk, lost a bet, got titfucked, got cum in eye, fucked a relationship but showered in a really cool shower.\\n\\n\\nEdit: So... I was piss drunk when I made this post and simply put I would much rather have not posted this story at all. However as people seem to be deeply intrigued in it I will leave it up. I apologize for the parts of the story that seems to be just rambling as I had quite a bit to drink last night. Also, to those that gave me the awards I greatly appreciate it. Actually just happened a few minutes ago at the time of writing this. I\\'m one of those losers who loves Snapchat streaks. I collect them diligently and keep them going with morning and night streaks every day. At this point I have streaks with about twenty five people, some of them reaching almost 500 days.\\n\\nI say all that to set up the fact that I\\'m affecting several people that I\\'ve been doing this with for a long time. Today I was brewing coffee in my giant metal percolator. It\\'s very shiny and... reflective.\\n\\nI sometimes sleep in the nude and last night was no exception. This morning I was waiting until I had to get ready for work before I got dressed, so I was still very naked when I decided to send my daily morning streak. Today I decided to take a picture of my brewing coffee as the picture (I\\'m not very creative). I did so, added a couple of \"good morning\" graphics, and sent it without a second thought.\\n\\nThen one of my friends took a screenshot of my streak, prompting confusion. He sent it back to me and asked \"Uh... did you mean to have your dick in the pic?\"\\n\\nSure enough, in the picture, my dick is CLEARLY visible in the reflective surface of the percolator. I just sent this to 25 people and so far only a couple of them have opened it, but I now live in dread of what this day brings.\\n\\nTL;DR sent a reflective dick pic to 25 people via snapchat streaks and a coffee percolator\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**UPDATE** since everyone keeps asking. Fortunately for me but disappointingly for many of you, no one seemed to notice except my friend who told me about it in the first place. At least, no one said anything to me about it so far. Lesson learned!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nDouble edit! For those who are wondering what a streak is, it\\'s simply when you send a snap to someone and get one in return once every 24 hours. After three days, you get a little number next to their name showing how many days in a row you\\'ve snapped.\\n\\nFor those who are insulting me for being a grown man who uses snapchat, I\\'m sorry that my usage of a social media app that takes perhaps one full minute out of my day is so annoying to you. Let people enjoy things!\\n\\nFor those reminding me that there\\'s no way 25 people care about what I do in the morning, *I know that*. You think I care about whatever bullshit they send me back? We do it to see the little number go up and get that quick dopamine rush, not because we give a shit about what coffee we\\'re drinking!\\n\\nFinally, god damn you thirsty bitches, [here\\'s the picture](https://imgur.com/a/qFOWhbP). It\\'s not super noticeable unless you know it\\'s there.\\n\\n**Final edit:** No, I will not be starting an OnlyFans. Please stop DMing me about it xD Last week, me and my family got a puppy for the first time. He likes to follow us around the house and is generally near me.\\n\\nI also happen to have IBS, which has been aggravated by the stress of having a new puppy, and has apparently decided to manifest itself by me farting incessantly. I’m not talking about quiet farts - I mean these loud, lawnmower-engine sounding farts that you would not expect to come out of a very small girl.\\n\\nSince these farts are rather embarrassing, I’ve taken to jokingly blaming them on my puppy. Whenever I fart in front of my family and he’s around (which is most of the time), I would loudly say his name in a scandalized voice. This would usually result in him walking over to me, so of course when my adorable puppy comes over, I would pet him and kiss him.\\n\\nYesterday, I was home alone with him and he was on the other side of the room. I let out a roaring fart, but since I was alone, I didn’t say his name to “blame” it on him. However, as soon as he heard it, he still walked right over to me and sat down, tail wagging, waiting to be pet, which is when I realized I accidentally trained my dog to associate my farts with coming over to me and getting pet. \\n\\nTL;DR I accidentally trained my puppy to come (not that time of come, you pervs) when I fart.\\n\\nedit: [dog tax](https://www.reddit.com/r/sploot/comments/itxmm2/kitchen_sploots_are_his_favourite/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) I recently purchased a large beanbag chair for myself to watch movies on in my basement. There has been a persistent cricket issue in my basement that I have not gotten around to addressing yet. While jerking off on said beanbag, I felt something slimy and sort of greasy in my asscrack. I immediately assumed this was some ass sweat from the jerk off session and wrote it off. Well, once I finished the act, I scratched the crevice, and to my surprise, the disfigured body of a still twitching cricket wound up on my hands. I flicked the cricket away swiftly and quickly rid of any cricket residue in my glory hole. Cricket guts now cover the edge of my beanbag, and I am on the brink of vomiting just writing this.\\n\\nTL;DR- felt something weird in my ass while jerking off, was a dumbass and decided to continue without taking precautions, and came with a cricket still squished between my cheeks. Have you ever dated someone who makes you feel sexy and wanted? Yeah me neither, until I started dating my current boyfriend. Feeling sexy and irresistible is a new experience for me and my libido has never been higher because of it. So TIFU by trying to be sexy and waking him up with a blowjob. We both sleep naked and when I woke up, he had a bit of a semi and I know it\\'s a fantasy of his to wake up to someone sucking his dick. \\nSo\\nI go down. I\\'m honestly turning myself on and I know as soon as he wakes up we\\'re gonna have sex and I\\'m all for it. So I\\'m being light and gentle at first, to not wake him up immediately  and hes stirring a little bit. So I start getting a little more intense with it, and then he came? Oooooooh god no he didnt cum....he started pissing in my mouth. A torrent of morning pee into my mouth, then on the bed, and himself. To make matters a little extra fucked up, because the universe thought this wasn\\'t bad enough, I threw up all over my side of the bed. He  jolts awake, mid stream, thinking he has  just pissed the bed, to find this gigantic mess of vomit and piss everywhere. We spent the morning cleaning up the mess. We talked about it, but in that moment we didnt even know what to say to each other, all we could do was laugh hysterically like two maniacs in a bed covered in fluids.\\n\\nTL;DR Tried to wake my boyfriend up by giving him head, and he pissed in my mouth and I threw up on the bed. As an ICU nurse, these last few weeks have found me trapped in the COVID-19 ICU at my hospital. The whole unit (and the neighboring floor) has been turned into negative airflow rooms to keep airborne COVID-19 particles from infecting the rest of the hospital. This isnt a big issue for the semi-sick covid patients, since they are generally droplet and contact precautions. But in the ICU, most of these patients are ventilated and constantly aeresolizing this virus.\\n\\nAnyways, I\\'m lucky enough to have a PAPR, which is a hood that goes over your head and shoulders that\\'s hooked up to a machine around your waist by a tube. This machine blows air into the hood, making it so any aerosolized material in the air is pushed away from my face. It\\'s not a closed system like a scuba tank or anything though; all the air that\\'s blown at your face is sucked in through this belt machine, which is filtering it constantly through a 3M filter.\\n\\nAnyways, I\\'m all geared up and working in a patients room when I have to pass some gas. The patients intubated and sedated, I\\'m wearing a hood, no one else is around- what\\'s the harm?\\n\\nI let a silent but deadly rip... right under this PAPR machines intake. Now, no particulate is getting through this thing, but gas sure does. I spent the next 5 minutes trying not to wretch as this hood circulates my toxic ass scent through my hood.\\n\\nNote to self, wear the papr on the front next time.\\n\\nTL;DR: dont toot in the air chute unless you wanna smell your own ass fruit\\n\\nEdit: [pic for reference](http://imgur.com/a/MGAMClL) \\nThis happened a couple hours ago and they’re still laughing\\n\\n\\nI was visiting my parents house for dinner with my family, and almost everyone in my family *of 7*  got apple watches recently and was talking about fitness tracking and heart rate monitoring *they’re all health nuts* and we got to the topic of resting heart rates and sleeping patterns and I was looking at my sleep monitoring and realized that my heart rate aggressively spikes every morning when I wake up so I brought it up with them and everyone was trying to think of what I could possibly be doing in the morning that causes my heart rate spike to an active heart rate so quickly. My sister and mom realized at the same time and started dying laughing until I realized what the first thing I do in the morning...\\n\\nTl:dr family looked at my heart rate patterns and figured out I masturbate every morning.\\n\\nEdit: to the 300+ comments that told me to say I do morning workout routines. WHERE WERE YOU AT DINNER BECAUSE I COULD HAVE USED YOU😂 My girlfriend and I have been together for several months now. We only see each other on weekends due to distance and work schedules, but this last weekend I fucked up. \\n\\nHer friend was hanging out with us, who is also female. They were making out and grabbing on each other, and well one thing led to the next and I was involved. We went to the bed and started fucking, but before I went inside her friend, I looked at my girlfriend in the eyes and asked, \"is this okay?\" \\n\\nShe said yes, but shortly after this, my girlfriend got up and left but we thought she went to the bathroom. After a few minutes, we stopped having sex and went to look for her but couldn\\'t find her for 15 min. \\n\\nMy girlfriend was understanding and wasn\\'t upset with me, or her friend, or so I thought. I called her the following night cause I felt extremely guilty. She said it was okay and it was just a spur of the moment kind of thing. She simply asked that I never do it again. \\n\\nCome this weekend, she breaks up with me over text saying she doesn\\'t want to be with someone who slept with her friends. I absolutely love her so much but I let lust get between us. \\n\\nI really fucked up guys..\\n\\nTL;DR: I fucked my girlfriend\\'s friend with her and then she broke up with me because she doesn\\'t want to be with someone who slept with her friends. Ok guys, gonna make it short. This happened like a year ago, but i just remembered it and wanned to share  \\n\\n\\nIt was around noon, was feeling hungry, so i headed to my countries version of uber eats to order some nice lunch. Found the food i liked, proceeded to checkout and noticed, that the box where you can leave some message for the restaurant had no limit for characters.  \\nSo i got an idea, to \"prank\" the restaurant by copypasting entire bee movie script there, so it will get printed on the receipt. Thats where the FU happened. Few mins after i sent the order, got message it was canceled .. ok no big deal, might happen, so i wanned to order the some food somewhere else, when i noticed some black-ish smoke in a distance (it wasnt that far away, but was studying and didnt wanna leave my spot in library). Well shortly after, also like 2 firetrucs passed by, heading the restaurants direction. (ps: was on ground floor, \"wall\" was from glass, so you could easily se on the street)  \\nThe next day i read in local newspapers, that the exact restaurant caught fire because of some cash register malfunction\\n\\nTL;DR: Ordered food online and set restaurant on fire by pasting bee movie script into the order-note box\\n\\n\\nhave to edit here: thank you for those shiny medals gyus/gals! made my day <3 Obligatory this happened about 18 years ago and, please, read the whole thing before passing judgement.  :)\\n\\nFirst, though, a little back story.  My oldest child, my only daughter, was born in 1998.  She\\'s healthy, smart, witty, beautiful, and all the things a proud dad could hope for.  At the time of this story, though, she was only about 3 years old.  \\n\\nMy second child, however, was not so lucky with the health issues.  At five weeks old, he had a near-miss SIDS incident that left him with massive brain damage and a host of other issues that stemmed from that.  At the point of this story, he was in the state\\'s Early Intervention program, which meant that we as a family got extra assistance with a few things, my daughter got preferential treatment to get into early education programs and a few things like that.  For the events of this story, he was (as I recall) with my parents this day, but that\\'s how we came to be at the particular event where this TIFU occurred.\\n\\nThese events happened sometime in early 2002.  The early intervention program was having a dinner/event for family members, and so my wife, daughter and I were all going to this event.  Due to life being life, my wife and daughter were heading to the event from home and I was heading directly there from work, meeting up with them there.\\n\\nSo, here we are, at an Early Intervention event sponsored by a state aid program, and the wife and I are chatting with director of this program, who is essentially a state empowered agent to look after the welfare of special needs children and their families.  We\\'ll call her Jenn for the sake of this story, which is definitely not her real name.  My wife and I both like this state agent and were enjoying a conversation with her and my daughter was making the most of the event that did have other kids but was mostly for adults.\\n\\nThe conversation turned, however, when Jenn asks my daughter what\\'s on her mind.  I swear, to my dying day I will never forget exactly how my daughter replied to her: \"**Mommy doesn\\'t like it when Daddy beats us**.\"\\n\\nI was, I hope understandably, speechless.  I looked to my wife and she also had no clue where the hell that came from...  we looked to Jenn who was looking back and forth between us, because she\\'d been working with us for a while and didn\\'t think me capable of beating either of them.  We turned back to my daughter to try to figure out what she was talking about.\\n\\nIt seems that since we arrived at the event separately, one of us had to get there first and that day it was me.  When my wife arrived she noticed my car already in the parking lot. Since we had joked about racing there, she said something to my daughter to the effect of \"Oh, darn, Daddy beat us.\"  As in, I beat them to the event.  I arrived first.  But my daughter took the phrase \"I beat them\" to heart, and was happy to share it with Jenn when she asked how my daughter was.  After all, she was 3, why would she be worried about other meanings of the phrase?\\n\\nOnce we figured that out, we shared a relieved if somewhat awkward laugh. The rest of the event came and went uneventfully;  honestly, I don\\'t remember much of it after that, as I was still recovering from the \"OMFG\" shock at what my daughter had said before we figured it out.  Considering that my daughter said that to a state employee I\\'m very glad she knew us well enough to take the time to figure out what happened with us, but, yeah.  I do still enjoy reminding my daughter every once in a while of how she did me wrong that day, but she usually rolls her eyes at me when I do.  \\n\\nTL;DR:  My daughter told a state employee that I beat her and my wife to an event in a way that could have been easily misunderstood. While overseas, one of the things we were charged with doing on a regular basis was disposing of insane amounts of illegal drugs. We usually were most concerned with the opium/poppy industry; however, a larger pot bust was enough to give us something to do. Typically, we would raid a compound and find a couple 100 lb sacks of ground marijuana. Enough pot for a lifetime. The pot fields grow wild out there, football fields in size, and 8-10 feet tall. Sometimes taller. It’s grown in a way that corn is grown in the civilized world, with irrigation and pesticides. It’s a remarkable sight. \\n\\nFor those of you who have read my prior posts that mention marijuana use, I would like to clarify… I never touched the stuff overseas. Far too terrifying. They also mix pot with chicken poop and various other things so there’s another reason to steer clear.\\n\\nAnyways, usually we just covered a couple hundred pounds of ground pot in diesel fuel, lit it on fire and went home. Far too risky to hang around and wait for it to burn. Well one day while searching a suspected HME (explosives) manufacturing house, we happened upon a room that had 7 or 8 100-pound bags (320 kg) of the sticky icky. If you know anything about pot, you know its fluffy. 700+ pounds was an absolute mountain. My mind reeled at how much money this would be worth back home. A literal fortune. This looked like The Hulk fell into a wood chipper. \\n\\nA genius counterpart suggested that we bring Mt. Kushamanjaro back to our base and burn it in our own burn pit, rather than leaving it here. \\n\\n“Well that’s a clever idea!” I thought, relieved that we wouldn’t have to risk getting ambushed with the biggest freaking smoke signal ever built. \\n\\nAh but ambushed, we were. The bags were loaded into pickup trucks and driven back to the base, hastily sliced open and dumped into the burn pit. I ran the idea by our leadership and we had a thumbs up all around. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe early effects weren’t bad. The smoke column went mostly straight up, however as it grew in size, it lazily pushed itself in the direction of the nearest guard tower, Tower 3. Jokes went around as we awaited the results. Coughing could be heard immediately and the private in Tower 3 called out to us: \\n\\n“Hey we need to…. We need to… do something… like… now?” I could hear the brain cells slowing with every word. \\n\\nThis was a churchy type kid, having never been exposed to the sticky.\\n\\n“Sergeant, I’m… I’m high as shit!” He yelled moments after. I panicked and sought a solution that would keep leadership out of it. \\n\\n“Someone, relieve him!” (genius)\\n\\nSeveral individuals raced to take over Tower 3. We devised a plan for a 10-minute rotation until the wind subsided. How perfectly that column of smoke engulfed the tower was perplexing. Like a lazy pot-nado. Around this time our fire really kicked up as the wind shifted and grew in intensity... right in the direction of the command post, and subsequently Tower 2. Several high-ranking leaders came out, looking furious. \\n\\n“Who the hell approved this!!?” The First Sergeant yelled\\n\\n“I believe you did..” The CO responded \\n\\n“Well where’s the detail that brought it in?” \\n\\n“That would be us First-Sergeant” Myself and a couple others. I thought back to the decision-making process and realized that I had a ton of responsibility in the matter. In fact, I was *really worried.* Abnormally concerned… I felt myself stammering over words, felt my heart begin to race, kept thinking “ohjesusohjesusohjesus I’m going to get caught...!” It was in that moment that I realized, I was sketching. I was proper baked, and not handling my shit well. \\n\\nI turned around and just sort of, left the conversation. My leaders did not need to see me drool. I hazily walked back toward Tower 3, ground zero, to find a dozen or so soldiers laying in each other’s laps, goofing off, and having a ‘deep philosophical conversation’ about a bug’s journey through life.\\n\\nInert.\\n\\nI wrote Tower 3 off as combat ineffective and wandered toward Tower 2 to see if I could help, a big stupid smile on my face. They seemed to be in better shape however were arguing about how long each should have to be in the tower. Apparently, the concept of time was no longer a thing. I started to address the issue with a random sergeant in the area, but we got side tracked in conversation about the effects of diesel fuel mixed with the pot. We theorized something stupid about how the diesel fuel had longer to soak in the smoke, and that it was causing the anger among the Tower 2 crew.\\n\\nI assume the wind was completely dead now, as I remember the whole compound being covered in a light haze. [**Here**](https://imgur.com/a/LVZQg8F) is a crude blueprint (greenprint?) of the above narrative.\\n\\nAt this point I thought it would be best to find a snack and wondered to our dining tent to see what was up. Here I was reunited with half my squad. Instead of relishing in the moment, there was a trouble cloud over our heads, and I could tell we were all pretending to be perfectly fine. Minus a couple phantom giggles, we did a pretty good job getting through a meal. \\n\\nAlthough I was personally quite effected, I think someone put the fire out, and a few hours later it was business as usual. A lot of stories flew around for months about the leadership getting high and what not. I did not personally see it. I came from ground zero, saw the leaders and returned to ground zero where I belonged. I theorize that my leaders took the same approach of handling it without involving their bosses. No repercussions followed.\\n\\n \\n\\nTL;DR – Tried to burn a bunch of contraband, the wind shifted and the contraband burned us.  \\n\\nThis happened 30 minutes ago and is exactly what I get for going out during COVID.\\n\\nI would also like to add that I\\'m still tipsy from the marg, so sorry for any errors...\\n\\nSo today is my birthday and has been incredibly uneventful. I took the day off of work, but despite that it\\'s just been a normal day. No friend group gatherings, no gifts, just another day (and I\\'m totally fine with that). My mom on the other hand felt bad that there was no celebration of any kind, so she was insistent that we go to my favorite restaurant (a local Mexican restaurant). I agreed to go for a very early dinner.\\n\\nWe get there and are having a good time and it was nice to pretend the world was normal for a moment. I ordered a margarita, they ID\\'d me and figured out it was my birthday. Fast forward to the end of the dinner and I thought I was in the clear from a birthday celebration from the staff. As they bring the bill, they put a big sombrero on my head and started clapping and singing and set down a dessert in front of me. One of the guys had whipped cream on his finger and went in to put it on my nose, drunk me didn\\'t comprehend that and was very confused. Due to the big sombrero covering my face, he was kind of stumbling trying to find my nose, I thought \"oh I know what I\\'m supposed to do!\" and my dumbass self sucked the whipped cream off his finger.\\n\\nI realized immediately after that, no \\'Dundermifflinhoe, that is not how you interact with strangers\\' but it was too late. They picked up the pace of their singing and the guy ran away right after and hid in the kitchen. The whole restaurant (which granted was like 10 other people, but still) stared at me and my mom couldn\\'t stop laughing.\\n\\nWe got put the dessert in our to-go box and left. 23 years is off to a great start.\\n\\nTL;DR - My waiter was trying to put whipped cream on my nose to celebrate my birthday, drunk me was confused and sucked his finger instead\\n\\nEDIT: getting a lot of hate for going out during COVID. I agree with everyone saying that it was a stupid decision to go out to eat. It was. I know I’m the asshole. Thank you for all the lovely reminders in my inbox. I wanted a break from the stresses of life and went about it the wrong way. I take full responsibility.\\n\\nEDIT PART 2: Guys, thank you so much for all the kind words. I appreciate every single person who has reached out to me. My inbox is flooded with messages and I can’t respond to everyone but just know that the positive responses really turned my day around. First, some background. My partner always leaves a little bit of Coke Zero in his can after drinking it. And this is totally gross, but I love the taste of flat soda. So whenever I clean up the empty cans, I’ll take the last swig of whatever is left over. Really disgusting. I get it. Nobody’s perfect. This is my flaw. \\n\\nANYWHO. This morning I go to do this, as I always do. Come to find out, he had done a water test to test the ammonia, ph, nitrates etc in our aquarium’s salt water the night before. He had dumped the remnants of the test chemicals and salt water into his Coke Zero can, unbeknownst to me. \\n\\nI picked it up this morning and was like “oh man, score there’s a lot left in here” and geared up to slurp it down. Slurp slurp slurp. Yes, I’m a disgusting human. Get over it. \\n\\nOf course, upon initial contact with this horrific concoction, I had realized my grave error. I ended up spitting it out all over the living room and, not long after, my throat started to tingle. I mean, REALLY tingle. \\n\\nThis is when panic set in. I was alone. My dogs just stared at me. \\n\\nThis is how I die. What would the coroner think?\\n\\nI ended up calling poison control to ask them if I was dying and had to tell them that I had accidentally consumed a mixture of aquarium water testing chemicals and salt water. This is harder to explain than one might think. Especially when you think you might be actively dying. \\n\\nAt this point my throat is PULSATING and I can feel my pulse quickening. I know I am probably imagining these problems, but I can’t help it. \\n\\nAfter asking me several times, “Wait, you did what?” the kind man at poison control told me to gargle with vinegar, monitor my symptoms, and to not consume aquarium saltwater test chemicals ever again. \\n\\nNo shit. \\n\\nTL;DR: TIFU by drinking what I thought was leftover flat soda. It was actually a mixture of flat soda, saltwater, and aquarium test chemicals. The fear of imminent death ensued. I’m fine, and poison control got a kick out of my story.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\n\\nOh, wow. Thanks for the awards. My first gold, all because I’m a dumbass. \\n\\nMay my story be a cautionary tale to you all. Don’t drink beverages that have been left open and unattended, and don’t revel in someone else’s backwashed flat soda. \\n\\nAs for my boyfriend, yeah...he fucked up, too. At least we learned our lesson with minimal consequences. A fuck up all around. Be careful with chemicals. They ain’t playing around. This happened while ago while I was traveling to the US on a 9h flight from Europe.\\n\\n*Context: I\\'m Greek / Lebanese and am a rather moderately hairy person, most of it on my face.*\\n\\nI had an important meeting to attend in the US that was happening a few hours after I land, so I had to freshen up and prepare while on the plane still. A few hours into the flight, I went to the bathroom to change my clothes, wash my face and freshen up, shave and trim my beard, put on some deodorant etc. Took my backpack with me since I\\'ve got everything in there. \\n\\nAfter spending some 5 minutes in there, struggling to move around the tiny bathroom stalls on planes, someone knocks on the door. I brushed it off with something along the lines of “I’ll be right out”, I thought someone needs to use the bathroom but it was clearly occupied. Another 5 minutes go by and I start hearing chatter outside and could feel some people moving around. I hear a knock again, at this point i had my shirt off and my face was half shaven with mousse all over the other half. I open the door in this questionable state. To my surprise I see 3 flight attendants looking terrified standing around the door... Two women and one man. So I laugh and ask them if there is a rule and a timer for how long you can use the bathroom or what exactly was going on. The man proceeds to tell me some passengers complained because they saw me go in with my backpack, and i stayed in there a while, so they were scared something was going down and reported it to the flight crew. Mind you it wasn’t even at the \"questionable\" beard or stage or anything... it had grown for some two weeks or more give or take ~~just a week or more of fuzz~~ (*edited to say that definitely more than a week’s btw should have been clearer*). So I laugh some more and tell him I fully understand, but I had an important meeting upon landing hence freshening up, and that i’ll need a bit longer to just shave fully and finish grooming myself. He then excuses himself and we laugh a bit then he goes away. \\n\\nShortly after he comes back knocking and I open, this time in a new fresh shirt and fully shaved, and i ask what’s up? He tells me that some passengers are still concerned i’m shaving my beard and thought I was shaving my body too since I opened the door with mousse dripping on my face and without my shirt on. I was very confused and at that stage started to get annoyed, just let me use the damn bathroom in peace there are many others people can use. **Turns out that apparently some extremist muslim groups do this before they \"get up to no good\"** (aka sacrifice their life in an act of holy retribution/terror/whatever the fuck you want to call it). Something about going to heaven freshly clean... So at this point i’m laughing too hard but I tell him I fully understand and that this is a good thing they check on such instances. I’d rather be safe than sorry. I then show him my meeting email with the time and date for the sake of their peace of mind. I also mentioned I was Christian born but not religious and that even as a Lebanese dude I had no idea terrorists were shaving before acts of terror, thanks for the information I didn\\'t really need. \\n\\nWe then had a chat outside with the rest of the flight crew, laughing and making jokes. I could tell they were still a tiny bit paranoid but 95% apologetic. They didn\\'t check my bag or anything and now that I think about it I should have shown them what was in the bag (snacks, iphone cables, some books, clothes and my toiletry bag).\\n\\n**TL;DR - I groomed myself on a flight and the flight crew along with some passengers went full anti terror alert mode while fearing this was something more than just one beardy dude shaving and putting on fresh clothes.**\\n\\n----\\n\\nEdit: \\n\\n[Here\\'s a photo of where my beard was at more or less before I shaved](https://i.imgur.com/mOFrIPP.jpg) \\n\\n[And here\\'s a photo I took after I was done with the whole ordeal](https://i.imgur.com/noFtQ0o.png?1) (hoodie was swapped before meeting lol)\\n\\n----\\n\\nEdit 2: For the many \"why would you shave on the plane\" queries - it was a special circumstance trip that I booked on a day\\'s notice and my beard grows too fast so shaving before we took off would mean I\\'d have some annoying stubble when we landed. I wanted to look as fresh as I could for that meeting and I did what I could with the given circumstances. I also groomed myself during a “lights off” time where everyone is asleep. Queues to bathrooms don’t form during that time. Remember, they **offer you shaving kits** on some business flights so to think anyone shaving on a plane is extreme is funny but understandable if you’re unaware. They have plugs for razors, hair dryers, etc in the plane bathroom stall. I mean they change poopy kids in there so think about that for a second Reddit. \\n\\n\\nThanks for the feedback r/tifu! Can\\'t believe this *blew up*. tldr at end\\n\\nI live in a small apartment building in the middle of the city. Even though living directly in the city, the area tends to be really quiet. \\n\\nI come home from work, eat whilst watching TV and slowly make myself hover to my beloved bed.\\nThe urge of jerking off has been there all day, i just ignored it for today tho. Everything was quiet when i heard the first few things starting to bang against the other side of my wall. Thinking nothing of it i slowly drift off into sleep when suddenly, WHAM another strike hits. This time louder and more shaky.\\nI hear silent “moans” and loud “humping”. \\nWe just recently got new neighbors, a young couple mid 20s. \\n\\nAs already mentioned, the urge to whack it was there all day, so i did what any man would do: i start jerking off to what i believe are sex sounds.\\n\\nTime goes on and the noises are getting louder and louder.\\nRight as i finish i hear a loud *THOMB* like somebody just hit the floor.\\nIn shook, heartrate at around 200bpm, i sit there.\\nI stare into the emptiness of my room.\\n\\nSitting there for what felt like years, was only 1 minute.\\nSlowly i get myself together and start cleaning up.\\nNo new noise has since been heard.\\n\\nDone with everything i lay in bed once again, this time ready for sleep.\\n\\nThat’s when i hear a loud *KNOCK KNOCK* from the other apartments door.\\n\\n“Police, please open the door” \\n\\nThe door opens, the policemen swarm into the building.\\nThe woman screaming, as she is being brought to the outside.\\nI look out the window \\n\\n1 Cop and 1 Ambulance car.\\n\\nMy thoughts as slowly realize i just did the do to a woman getting beaten up.\\n\\nI feel bad now.\\nI could’ve helped.\\n\\nThis shit gon give me PTSD for sure.\\n\\n\\ntldr:\\nwhat sounded like 2 people having sex, turned out to be a man beating up his woman. which i accidentally beat my meat to.\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nchanged: “flick it” to “whack it”.\\n\\nEDIT 2:\\n\\nwell lol this kinda blew up.\\nso thanks for the gold and these other awards.\\nstill in shock tho\\n\\nEDIT 3:\\n\\na lot of people think this is fake / a copy pasta / stolen.\\nsadly it’s not. \\nalso i don’t know why people say “free karma”, i created the throwaway account especially for this instance. i’m never gonna use it again.\\n\\nothers think i’m a freak, like yeah alright. \\nand you’re flawless, aye? TIFU by going blind and posting in r/pics \\n\\nA friendly Redditor [u/kevindavebob] suggested I post on TIFU so thank you for the great idea (and for being nice to me). This is certainly a TIFU and it all just happened so I’m still feeling pretty terrible about it.\\n\\nI have a rare disease called Usher syndrome that is causing me to go blind and deaf. One of the ways I cope with having this disease is by traveling whenever I can to create visual memories before I go blind. I went to Iceland to try to see the northern lights. I can’t even begin to describe the feeling of actually being able to see the northern lights. I didn’t know if it would be too late for me to see them. \\n\\nI really wanted to share my story about going blind and seeing the northern lights, hoping to generate awareness for Usher syndrome. Only having a phone camera and being a very amateur photographer, I certainly can’t capture the beauty and experience of witnessing the lights. I was able to find a public use image on the internet that would properly convey my story and experience. The photo has been linked so many times that I didn’t spend time searching for the original source (you can see where this is going….).\\n\\nWith my genuine caption, generic photo, and source to my story and blog (no ads) in the comments, I posted in r/pics. I chatted with a few kind Redditors about my story and was really happy to see people learning about Usher syndrome. Then I went to sleep….\\n\\nWell, all hell broke loose.\\n\\nMy post made it to the front page of r/all. #1 in fact. I woke up to THOUSANDS of hurtful messages and comments – calling me a liar and telling me I don’t have my disease, Redditors telling me they’re happy I’m going blind if it is true, that I should kill myself, etc. (there were some way worse ones I won’t write here).\\n\\nI wish the mods took my post down while I was sleeping but it made it to the front page and stayed up for some reason despite Reddit telling me I was a fraud. It then got posted to r/quityourbullshit where I got even more hate. I didn’t say it was my picture, but I didn’t credit the photographer. I SERIOUSLY fucked up.\\n\\nI can’t even tell you guys how upset all of this made me. Living with Usher syndrome is NOT easy. There is no cure and it’s terrifying losing both my vision and my hearing. My vision especially. I want nothing more than to try to raise awareness for Usher syndrome to discover a cure. Not just for myself, but for everyone else who also has to live with this rare disease. \\n\\nI was so focused on my mission to raise awareness and share my story, I didn’t make the effort to credit the photographer the way I should have. I fucked up Reddit. \\n\\nI am getting so much hate now, even outside of Reddit from people finding me on my blog and other social accounts just to attack me. I’m sad that my post which intended to raise awareness for Usher syndrome turned into fuel for such negativity. We have too much negativity in this world and it’s got to stop at some point. \\n\\nThank you to everyone who was understanding and realized I made a mistake. Thank you Luke Stackpoole for making your beautiful photo free for the public to use. I’m sorry for not taking the time to find you and credit you before. Your entire portfolio https://www.withluke.com/ is stunning.\\n\\nFrom the bottom of my heart, I am sorry for misleading everyone and not posting correctly on r/pics.\\n\\nI really did fuck up, though. \\n\\n\\nTLDR; I tried to raise awareness for Usher syndrome by posting a picture on r/pics and failing to credit the photographer, Luke Stackpoole. My post made it to the front page and Reddit now hates me.\\n\\nEdit: A nice Redditor (u/omichandralekha) suggested I share the non-profit that donates to Usher syndrome research so here you go (no need to click on it if you don\\'t want to, it just takes you to the homepage of this non-profit where you can learn more about it all) - The Usher Syndrome Society: www.ushersyndromesociety.org. Also, full disclosure: I am on the board of directors and it\\'s a pretty amazing organization! Mandatory: this happened last week but still\\n\\nSo, my friend and I have been close for a long time and he tells me all his secrets because he knows I would never (intentionally) tell his secrets to anyone. I am known in my friend group for being a steel trap for secrets because I don\\'t care, and don\\'t have a good enough memory to share with anyone what they tell me.\\n\\nMy friend, lets call him Hiram, confided in me a while ago that he went to hang out with a female cousin of his, lets call her Amelia. Well, Hiram and Amelia always had a weird relationship because Hiram always found Amelia very attractive, and he thought she would flirt with him sometimes. They ended up going to a movie together and ended up playing hide the cucumber in the back of his PT Cruiser. He tells me this in a dairy queen parking lot, and I nearly had aneurysm. So, I sat on the secret for like 2 years, and I was doing so good in the whole \"not sharing earth shattering secrets\" department.\\n\\nFast forward to last week. I was hanging out with Hiram, and some of his other cousins, all of whom are men who he has not had sex with (to my knowledge), and we were just playing video games and having a good time. At some point Amelia comes up in conversation between all of us. His male cousins snicker a little bit because apparently they knew he had a crush on her at some point, but I interpreted their snickers as them knowing that Hiram had boned Amelia. I wasn\\'t too wrong for thinking this because these guys tell each other EVERYTHING. So, anyway I say \"dude I still cant believe you banged your cousin\" and one of his other cousins yells \"YOU WHAT\". I think at that moment I saw Hirams life force leave his body. Now, I have to live with the fact that I may have just destroyed an entire family with one sentence.\\n\\nSo, anyway I\\'m now going into witness protection because Hiram is going to fucking kill me, forward any of my mail to my new address in Argentina.\\n\\nAdios muchachos\\n\\n\\\\- Anon\\n\\nTL;DR- I unearthed my friends long kept secret of him boning his cousin in front of his other cousins, and now for the rest of their lives family reunions are going to be very very awkward.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nedit: spelling Alrighty it’s now the morning after;  I am so embarrassed with myself and my hubby won’t stop laughing at me. \\n\\nLast night hubby & I had our first child free night in over 6 months (thanks for baby sitting grandma) & headed over to a friends place for a bbq & drinks around the bonfire. \\n\\nAs usual, as the night progresses the conversation turns to the topic of sex & masturbation. One of my girls friends starts talking about using the shower head to... you know 😉\\n\\nAs a 35 year old woman I had literally never thought to use the shower head for any other pleasure than washing my body. Sure, I have toys (I’m no prude) but I had never thought about using an everyday home appliance for my own pleasure down there. \\n\\nThe night ended and we went home. Smelling of the bonfire I tell hubby I’m having a shower & he says he doesn’t care, he’s going to bed. \\n\\nI should admit I was pretty tipsy by the time we got home (we took an Uber in case anyone’s concerned we drove under the influence). \\n\\nI’m washing myself  and my hair and the thought hits me. Ok, imma try the shower head... \\n\\nOk feels good but need more pressure.. \\n\\nOk feels better but I could still use more pressure.. \\n\\nOhh ok that’s just right. Yeah that’s the spot... oh YEAH THAT’S THE SPOT!!!!! \\n\\n...Screaming: Ahhhhhhhhhhh fuuuuuuuccckkkk! \\n\\nJust as I was having a mind blowing orgasm, my leg jerked and gave way. I slid to the left and went crash right into the shower screen, smashing it as I managed to land out of the shower holding myself planking on the toilet. \\n\\nHubby came running in and I’m telling you it was a fucking sight. \\n\\nI’m planked from the shower across the toilet (In like a stiff leaning position), glass everywhere, a bit of blood and a shower head just dangling from the wall going at full speed while I’m crying from the pain and laughing from the embarrassment. \\n\\nI fucked up y’all. \\n\\nIt takes hubby a few seconds to compose himself because he thinks this is the funniest shit that’s ever happened. \\n\\nI managed only a few cuts to my left arm from basically flying with the glass onto the toilet and a few cuts on my feet. Lucky.\\n\\nAnyway we went to the ED because I did have a few decent cuts but I only ended up needing 2 stitches in my arm and 3 on the side of my foot from where some glass got stuck. Again, lucky. \\n\\nI told the nurse & doctor that I slipped while cleaning the shower. You know, because most people clean their shower at 1am. \\n\\nI’ll be telling our landlord the same thing today. \\n\\nTL;DR went to town on myself with the shower head, as I orgasmed I slipped and fell through the shower screen and went to the ED for a few stitches.\\n\\nEdit: changed the TLDR for u/Nemyosel - hope this eases some pain mate\\n\\nEdit: thanks for reading about my misfortune, for sharing your stories and for having a laugh with (and at) me. Thanks for the awards too. \\n\\nTo answer the biggest question: I was embarrassed and panicked when I said I was cleaning and slipped rather than just saying I slipped. Stupid I know, but none of us are perfect. \\n\\nTo all the men jealous of the female clit, just remember you can pee anywhere with ease and we can’t so you’ve got that 😂\\n\\nTo the people who criticized my writing style, my overuse of the word hubby, who think I’m a man, who slid into my DMs just to slut shame me & tell me off- fucking hell just get over it and scroll on by. I’m not responding to anyone who attacks me, it’s pretty sad you’ve got nothing better to do than bring negativity where it’s just not needed. \\n\\nI’ve also learnt that the shower head seems to be the most common way for us females to get off and I’ve learnt a lot about how to do it safely so thank you! A friend-of-a-friend has apparently been into escape rooms for a while now, and finally decided to create his own as a Halloween party experience for his friends.\\n\\nSince I don\\'t know him, and wouldn\\'t realistically be coming to the party, I agreed to take part in a test along with three other random folks that had been gathered for the dry run. It ended up being a group of four people who totally didn\\'t know each other at all, as opposed to any sort of cohesive group of friends or employees.\\n\\nOur host told us a ton of rules and guidelines. Don\\'t break ANYthing, NO answers are hidden on or in something you have to ruin in order to see it, and so on. He was going to stand inside the room with us, but was to be ignored as if he wasn\\'t there. This was in case we needed any direction or if we started doing something against the rules. He wore a black mask and black clothing.\\n\\nImmediately at the start of the game, everyone got quiet and started looking around slowly. As I mentioned, no one knew each other - and it was really awkward. I didn\\'t want to be the \"guy who\\'s super excited to lead the group\", and I guess they didn\\'t either.\\n\\nThe escape room was history-themed. Computer-printed photos of historical figures and explorers on the walls, a cheap dollar store style globe on an end table, and so on. Lots of books stacked around.\\n\\nThe first thing I did was look at the combination lock on the door, which had four numbered rollers.\\n\\nI put in the first relevant number I thought of, 1492, the date Christopher Columbus landed in the Americas.\\n\\nLock opens.\\n\\nThings got a thousand times more awkward.\\n\\nI apologized and explained the situation to the host, who told me to sit down for the duration, re-locked  the door, and asked the remaining guests to figure out where the combination was hidden. The host was incredibly angry, but only in so much as I could hear it in his voice and see it in how he moved - mainly closing and re-locking the door hard. He didn\\'t call me out for doing an obviously brain-dead thing and didn\\'t say anything rude.\\n\\nSoonafter, I decided it\\'d be better if I just left, apologizing again.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR - Put the first thing that came to mind into a combination lock, ruined an escape room.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Edit:** Was told second-hand that he was (is?) mad I tried the lock right away instead of engaging with the puzzles at all. I can see how that can be considered a dick move, personally, but I appreciate everyone assuring me I didn\\'t FU. I agree with you on principle I suppose, but I also can see how going directly for the lock was rude in a certain light. The escape room was \"intended to be easier than normal\" for the guests, the majority of whom haven\\'t done one before. Dunno if that\\'s legit or an excuse, of course. Thanks for all the positive responses!! So today was pretty f*cking eventful. \\n\\nFirst, obligatory backstory: My best friend and I often go out on weekends, get drunk, party at clubs, etc. it’s a lot of fun when everyone’s enjoying themselves and letting loose. One weekend, my best friend’s older brother came home from Croatia ( First time in a couple years) to catch-up with the fam and had plans with him to go out on the weekend. He offers me if I want to come but I want them to have quality bro time so I pass, truly wanting them to catch-up and have some family time.\\n\\nIt just so happened that weekend of all weekends that my best friend (We’ll call him L) got into a fight with another group of guys. Although he and his bro didn’t sustain too much damage from the fight (The other group were wasted from alcohol and pills) L and I got into talking about joining a martial arts gym. It would be for fun and fitness, plus, learning how to defend yourself seemed smart.\\n\\nWe caught up and chilled at a local public playground (Keep in mind, imagine two grown ass young adults climbing up and around a tiny playground in broad daylight) and began discussing joining a local kickboxing gym. Being best friends, we started talking some sh*t, saying how much we’d deck the other and how we’d essentially easily F*ck the other up. We began to mock fight in public with parents and children walking by on the sidewalk with amusement tinged with judgement. \\n\\nIt was just two 18yr olds messing around. \\n\\nAll of a sudden, I say something stupid in a mock Japanese accent (I’m Asian.. chill) and proceed to attempt a jumping, flying, roundhouse, no-idea-where-the-f*ck-my-legis-going kick at L, when this child that couldn’t be over 8 jumps in and says “Hiiyaahh”\\n\\nI couldn’t stop my momentum and proceeded to YEET this kid into the sandpit... \\n\\nNo amount of bracing could protect our ears from the banshee scream that erupted from his mouth.\\n\\nI went into instant panic mode, running to the kid to check on him. He wasn’t seriously injured, but my leg collided pretty hard. \\n\\nHis older brother or something came over, laughing his ass off. I apologised profusely to both the kid and his brother, and when he stopped crying I talked him up about how strong he was to take such a ass whoopin.\\n\\nHis bro lightly scolded him for running into an area where two tall dipshits were flailing their legs and fists. All in all, it was pretty wholesome, the child had a new story to tell at school, and I got to kick a child in the face... Win-Win.      (that’s a joke)\\n\\nTL:DR\\nBest friend and I were pretend fighting in a public park and when I attempted to do a ridiculous kick I saw on UFC, a kid jumped in and became collateral damage. Worth it.\\n\\nEdit: Holy shit, thanks for the silver and gold, I am not worthy of this. I made this post at 12am last night and when I woke up, I was not prepared for the absolute ass load of humorous and kind comments. \\n\\nI appreciate you all!\\n\\nEdit #2: I didn’t make one point clear enough regarding the playground. Besides people walking past the area on the sidewalk, the playground was empty. L and I made sure that our presence wasn’t making anyone scared or uncomfortable, if there were children already playing, we wouldn’t have even entered the playground area at all.\\n\\nHope that kinda clears some shiz up Obligatory, wasn\\'t today, but 2 days ago.\\n\\nSo my gf and I adopted a new kitten a week ago. She\\'s a very curious kitten, as many are and she always has to be wherever my girlfriend or I go. She also has very little concern for personal space so that also makes for some interesting moments.\\n\\nWell my girlfriend was in the bathroom washing her face before bed, and I had to take a piss like a fire hydrant as I had been drinking some beers throughout the evening. So I went into the bathroom and began to pee. As I was standing there next to my girlfriend filling up the sparkling white bowl, with powerwasher type pressure, the sound of my piss splashing in the water suddenly disappeared and all I could hear was a sound that resembled water draining onto a carpeted floor. I looked down into my bowl of golden fury, and to my horror, the kitten was standing inside the toilet bowl with my stream of piss splashing off the back of her head. I started screaming \"OH FUCK!\" And managed to pinch off my stream. The kitten didnt seem to mind getting wet via golden shower, but as soon as I pinched off my stream she bolted out of the toilet and started sprinting around our apartment. This all happened in a matter of seconds and my girlfriend was standing there, jaw on the floor, and began laughing hysterically yelling at me to go catch the cat.\\n\\nIt took me a few minutes to get our kitten cornered and grab her soaked, shaking little body and bring her back to the bathroom. I set her in the tub and I had to hold this piss covered feline still while my girlfriend sprayed her down with the shower head. I got her dried off and then she ran away from me and has since been very cautious whenever she comes anywhere near me. The last few nights I\\'ve woken up to her sitting on my chest, face to my face, and staring into my soul. I dont know what shes planning, but I\\'m sure she\\'ll get her payback sooner or later.\\n\\nMy girlfriend thinks it\\'s the funniest thing shes ever seen, but she\\'s still a little salty that I pissed on our new kitten..\\n\\nTL:DR - I gave my first and hopefully last, golden shower.... To my new kitten...\\n\\nEdit - Vegeta! What does the scouter say about his upvote level?! IT\\'S OVER 9000!!!!!!!\\n\\nHere\\'s the little devil in question: https://imgur.com/a/nGv22WI My wife is great, let me start off with that. I am really shocked I ended up married to her; everybody that knows me never lets me forget how lucky I am. She is like a master at being functional, whereas I\\'m not. When we do household chores together, she gets this beatific expression of contentment; it\\'s adorable. \\n\\nAbout three months ago, we were both in the yard; I was mowing and she was gardening (we live in WA state; it is warmish here in the winter). I couldn\\'t help but notice how wonderful she looked. I stopped mowing, went over to her, and said something like \"I love you so much, you look so homely.\" She seemed fine. A week or so later, I said it again. \"You are the most HOMELY person I\\'ve ever met.\" She didn\\'t seem to respond as expected; I just figured she was down. \\n\\nSee, I thought \"homely\" was like some adorable snow white type shit; homes are cozy and make you feel safe, right? Here was my wife, going around the house, dusting and playing with the cat, saying hello to houseplants, and doing it in a way that gave me cozy, or what I thought were \"homely\" feelings. I kept calling her homely for another month or so; I could feel some distance between us but couldn\\'t source it. Then it happened.\\n\\nI got home from work, and went to give my (now sad and confused) wife a hug. \"My GOD you are just SO HOMELY!!\" She pushed me away, looked me right in the eyes, and said \"I...don\\'t think you know what that means. You\\'ve been saying it for months, and I really think you have NO idea.\" So I looked it up, and found that (at least in America) no, \"homely\" doesn\\'t mean cute, or cozy. It means ugly or unattractive.  I thought I was complimenting my wife whenever I called her homely, when I was really just killing her soul a little bit at a time. With that unfortunate misunderstanding fixed, we are now doing fine. \\n\\nTL;DR   I thought \"homely\" meant cute, and ended up calling my wife homely for months. Found out that It means ugly. We both died inside.\\n\\nEdit: To those who wonder why she took so long to tell me, all I can say is that I wondered the same thing. My wife is *extremely* chill; that\\'s part of what I love about her. What she told me was \"Your body language didn\\'t match up with the word.\" Every time I called her homely, I projected an otherwise kind and loving presence. I think that dissonance really weirded her out. She\\'s always struggled with assertiveness; that, her general chillness, and my strange demeanor was apparently a perfect storm that lead to repression.\\n\\nEdit #2: We live in Western Washington, which is quite warm in the winter compared to the upper Midwest where I grew up. As long as the grass is green, it\\'s warm to me. Okay, so by TIFU standards, this is pretty tame, but considering the years of agony I unintentionally put myself through, I think it qualifies.\\n\\nI have fairly weird-sized feet.  They\\'re very wide, but not all that long.  I have no arch to speak of.  I\\'m a fairly short guy, about 5\\'7\", and that has always played a role in my shoe size selection.  I\\'m pretty short so I should be wearing a fairly small size, right?\\n\\nWrong.\\n\\nWhen I was a kid, my mom would measure the new shoes she bought for me by pressing the toe and making sure I had about a half-inch to an inch of space to grow into.\\n\\nAs an adult, I assumed, well, since I\\'m full-grown, I should buy shoes in which my toes reach all the way to the end.  For me, that\\'s a size 10 (US).\\n\\nProblem was, I kept blowing out the sides of the shoes with my wide-ass feet... no problem, I\\'ll switch to size 10W.\\n\\nStill no luck.  Still blowing the sides out of them and suffering chronic foot pain.  My running shoes were so ill-fitted that I actually suffered a hairline fracture from running with my pancake feet jammed into those narrow little torture chambers.\\n\\nMy friend was getting rid of a bunch of stuff he didn\\'t need, including a pair of really nice brand-new size 11.5W Nikes.  I said, \"Sure, fuck it, I\\'ll take them, let\\'s see how they fit.\"\\n\\nOh.  My.  God.\\n\\nIt was like wearing pillows made of clouds on my feet.  I was walking on cotton candy and unicorn farts.  I had no idea how much misery I had been in until I wore those shoes.  I wonder now if some of my poor life decisions have just been because I was in a bad mood because of so much needless foot pain and didn\\'t realize it.  There\\'s about 3/4 of an inch of room in the toes but that doesn\\'t bother me at all.\\n\\nTL;DR - I\\'m almost 36, and for fully 18 years I have been wearing shoes a size and a half too small because I was too much of an idiot to try on larger shoes. So.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m 19 and living with my parents while I go to college online. My family is UBER Christian, Pentecostal, I\\'m-supposed-to-be-without-a-sex-drive-until-marriage Christian. They called me a whore because I kissed my boyfriend in front of them. They believe I\\'m a Satanist because I have a septum ring. (not because of my TST membership.)\\n\\n\\nThey leave for church every Sunday at 11 AM. At 10, they usually come into my room to ask if I\\'m coming with them. (I do just to avoid the drama of declining.) This morning, I woke up at 9, so I figured I had some time to mess around. Bf\\'s on the other side of the country and a woman still has needs, y\\'know?\\n\\n\\nI pull out the trusty pink 8-incher from the hidden sin compartment of my closet, and go to town. All is good. All feels good. When the deed is done, I wash off my adultery tool and leave it on my dresser to dry, STANDING UP. That mental image is very important. A giant dildo standing straight up on my dresser, as if my dresser is some perverse garden and the dildo is but a bloom growing from it.\\n\\n\\nI relax from this point, turn on Monsters Inc, move my succulent to the windowsill, typical lazy morning stuff.\\n\\n\\n10 AM rolls around. My dad knocks at my door.\\n\\n\\n\"eggblossom? Can I come in?\"\\n\\n\\nOf course, I let him in without a second thought.\\n\\n\\nDad: \"Are you coming to church with us?\"\\n\\n\\nMe: \"Sure. usual time?\"\\n\\n\\nDad suddenly stops talking.\\n\\n\\nDad: *glances at dresser*\\n\\n\\nAlso dad: *awkwardly closes door*\\n\\n\\nI\\'m confused, wondering why he would just quietly leave like that. I follow where he had been looking, and am instantly overcome with an embarrassment so deep I choke. Of course. Of course on church Sunday I would forget to put it away. Of course on church Sunday my father, someone who lives and breathes Jesus, would see the giant and obnoxiously bubblegum pink dildo of his teenage daughter. Of course.\\n\\n\\nI just really hope he doesn\\'t think I was masturbating to Monsters Inc.\\n\\n\\nTL ; DR\\nI had a good morning with my toy. My dad did not have a good morning witnessing that toy.\\n\\n\\nEdit: My first gold on this website is thanks to my airheaded masturbatory mistake. I\\'m laughing like a maniac and my parents keep asking why. Thank you so much!\\n\\n\\nEdit 2: two things! first, since it keeps having to be repeated in the comments, The Satanic Temple is not for people who actually believe in or worship satan. Second, I\\'m glad baring my sexual soul to the anonymous masses has led to so much love and support. I\\'m planning to move in with my bf, to a place without shame, where I can be free to line my patio with pink dildos if I so desired. San Francisco. (just kidding, but definitely far from my parents.)\\n\\n\\nNow, here\\'s what happened after.\\n\\n\\nWe get through church normally. I\\'m miserable. My parents are vibing, they are one with Christ and FEELING it. Maybe feeling it a little more than usual... I then realize my dad is definitely worshiping louder than usual. I really hurt this man.\\n\\n\\nThe service ends, and we pile into the truck to go home. We start to drive, and my mom tells me to stop looking sad in church. My dad then takes this as his in to rant. And rant he does. For what was easily ten minutes,  I hear about how disappointed he is. Now, he doesn\\'t mention the dildo or my sexuality by name, dare such foul words cross his lips. He just rants about who I am. How he wishes I was the way I used to be, how he misses the way I used to worship, and how he wonders why I want to be a demon. Funnily enough, this is not the first time I\\'ve heard those sentiments from him. Also, imagine discovering your child masturbates and you take that to mean they want to be a demon.\\n\\n\\nAll in all, everything\\'s fine! I\\'m not getting kicked out, I\\'m not having my room raided. My dad has just finally lost all hope for me. And you know what, that\\'s okay, because I was never going to be the person he wanted anyway. Here\\'s to starting off 2020 through leaving my dildo out and accidentally freeing myself of unrealistic expectations! Obligatory this happened about a month ago. Me and my girlfriend were sitting around bored during quarantine playing sporcle quizzes on the computer when somehow the question of what the average dick size is came up. Since we were sitting at a computer, I was like, well why not look it up? (This was my first mistake...)   \\nI pulled up this article that had a nice looking bell curve and you can look at the percentiles and what not. The average was around 5 inches or so, like yours truly. Then as she was looking she said \"Huh, I wonder where 9 inches falls on this graph\". At this moment, the gears started turning in my head.. What an oddly specific length to ask about. I ask her, \"why did you ask about 9 inches in particular??\" (my second mistake..) and then she casually mentioned that she had a \\\\*COUPLE\\\\* of exes that were 9 inches. A COUPLE!!! That\\'s about as likely as dating two guys that are taller than 6\\'10\"! (for perspective 6.3 inches was 95th percentile, 7 inches was 98th or something, so 9 is literally off the charts)  \\n\\n\\nNeedless to say, I became super insecure and for the next few days we\\'d be in the middle of sexy time and all of a sudden the image of her getting dicked down by a monstrous 9 inch cock twice my size would pop in my head killing my mood. Like there\\'s no way I can measure up.  Now a month later, I\\'m mostly over it but every once in a while the image pops in my head again and I think back to the moment where I wrote my own death sentence by asking questions I didn\\'t want to know the answer to.   \\n\\n\\ntl;dr TIFU by looking up average dick size, asking too many questions, and finding out all my gf\\'s exes are bigger than me by a lot Alright, so this is an old story, but when I found this sub, I had to share.\\n\\nWhen I used to be a Muslim, I had an app on my phone that would sound the adhaan, when it was time for prayer.\\n\\nI was on holiday the day of the fuckup. I got into a hotel elevator, this was shortly after the Paris attacks. There were roughly six people in it. Then the adhaan for prayer started blasting from my phone. For those who don’t know, the adhaan starts with allahu Akbar. When that blasted from my phone, the elevator went into mass hysteria, people were crying, screaming, another man tackled me and held me down. I had to explain to them that I wasn’t a terrorist. Then everyone just started laughing.\\n\\nI understand that everyone may think this isn’t a fuckup, but I feel like I shouldn’t have had my adhaan blasting like that after an incident like the Paris attacks.\\n\\nTl;Dr: adhaan blares in elevator, everyone thinks I’m about to blow up the elevator.\\n\\nEDIT: Holy fucking shit, this post has blown up.\\nThanks to the people who awarded me silvers and gold:)\\n\\nI need to clear some stuff up first:\\n\\nWhen I meant laugh, (ik, that segment was worded horribly) I’m not referring to full out laughter. Just some chuckling and light laughing(if that’s even a thing)\\n\\nPlease stop with all these questions about my religion, let me make this clear, if you message me about my religion, I will not respond. So stop.\\n\\nAnd one gripe, a large amount of negative comments,  in most of them the person commenting doesn’t seem to understand the full magnitude of the incident and why it provoked that response, please take the effort to fucking understand what I wrote first :)\\n\\nAnd to all the haters who are send messages to me calling this story fake, I really don’t care if you think my story is real or not. I’m not here to argue  about whether this actually happened. So last night I went out as I do every Saturday.\\nWhen I got there I met up with my friends and started the night with a couple of beers, but ended the night with a bit more than I could handle. After that I went straight home and instantly fell asleep on the couch as I was trying to lay down on it \"just to rest for a moment\".\\n\\nI woke up around 5 today and my right arm felt a bit weird. It was cold and I couldn\\'t move it at all.\\nAt first I didn\\'t panic at all because this has happened to me before because I sometimes sleep with my arm under my head. However today I slept with my arm under the side of my body ( I got a little over 100kg/220 lbs) with my back against the back-rest of the couch. After about 20 minutes of relaxing and massaging the arm with little to no signs of improvement I woke up my parents and after I explained my situation, my mom (who is a doctor) suggested we go to the hospital immediately.\\n\\nDuring my 2 hour stay at the hospital the arm became significantly better as the time went on.\\nHowever my fingers and my wrist (not nearly as much as fingers but it still felt a bit off) movement were problematic. After getting some tests done on the arm nerves (which I hope I never do again) I waited for the results. A little over an hour passes and the doctor came back with the results. \\n\\nIt appears that I have done damage to a nerve with my hip while I was asleep and will most likely never be able to fully contract my right hand (I\\'m right handed) fingers . At first the doctor didn\\'t know how I managed to fall asleep in such an uncomfortable position, but after I told him what I have done the night before he told me that it is a common thing, but that it usually doesn\\'t end up this badly.\\n\\nNow I\\'m sitting at home writing this one-handed on my phone contemplating life just because of two beers too much.\\n\\nTL;DR: Drunkenly fell asleep in a bad position and permanently damaged my arm nerves. This didn\\'t really happen today, more like over the course of the past 4 years. This is a throwaway because I\\'m very embarrassed. Sorry about formatting, I\\'m typing this on mobile. My girlfriend of 3 years passed away in a car accident about 4 years ago. It was a horrible event and I still haven\\'t been able to get back into the game since. I was and still am very much in love with her. Now to the fuck up.\\n\\nMy favorite possession of all time is her pillow. It smells like her, and I usually sleep with it every night. I haven\\'t washed it out of fear of losing the smell (I know, gross but I don\\'t think straight anymore). I hold it and hug it and it makes me feel warm inside. But this morning when I went for a particularly long morning run I started smelling the smell. Really strong. It confused me but I wasn\\'t going to start complaining.\\n\\nThis morning, about 20 minutes ago I arrived back home and went to change out of my workout clothes. And the smell grew more pungent. This was the moment I realized that after 4 years of sleeping with her pillow, I got it all dirty and smelly and that was the smell my brain now associates with her. I\\'m embarrassed and distraught that the smell I thought was hers has transformed into my sleep sweat.\\n\\nTL;DR- Slept with my passed away girlfriends pillow for 4 years, and have fallen in love with my man sweat.\\n\\nEdit: I would reply to all of you if I could, but today has been very emotionally taxing. Thanks for all your kind words. So this happend 2 days ago and im still cringing.\\n\\n\\n\\nRecently Ive taken an interest in chess and my school runs an after school chess club for beginners so I thought I\\'d go along. \\n\\nSo anyway here I am about to play my first game of chess ever. I sit down at the black pieces and my opponent has the white pieces (I should now mention my opponent was African American). The chess teacher says \"first rule of chess, whites go first.\" \\n\\nI think to myself wow that\\'s pretty racist but chess is an old game so maybe they kept the rule out of tradition. \\n\\nSo I grab a pawn and slide it forward, then I look up expecting my opponent to make his move. Instead I\\'m met with a look of confusion and horror, I begin to hear laughter from the people watching. \\n\\nI then realize my error \"oooh you meant the pieces\" I murmur. \\nThe teacher nods. \\n\\nNow everyone thinks I\\'m a massive racist.\\n\\nTL : DR whites go first in chess refers to the pieces and not the people playing You hear this story millions of times of people unknowingly hooking up with their relatives and finding out about this atrocity in the most awkward ways, and mine was no exception.. even had to create a new account cause it is so embarrassing \\n\\nI was talking to this guy on Hinge who had the softest of hazel eyes, and at the time, I thought he was the one. After exchanging a few messages, we decide to go on a date, and one thing lead to another, and we were a couple. We dated for about 5 months, until the horror struck us that we were relatives...\\n\\nSince we are both in our mid 20s, we were moved away from home and hadn’t had time to meet each other’s parents. Instead of doing the traditional, I’ll bring you over to meet my parents, and I’ll go over to meet yours, we decided for a dinner with both our parents. You can pretty much tell where this story goes now. \\n\\nLong story short, we took our families out to a restaurant, and when my father stood up from the table to introduce himself to my boyfriend’s mother, his face turned completely white, as he was looking directly at his cousin(Uncle’s daughter). It took her a second to realize as well. Since my family and his family live on opposite sides of the states, our parents hadn’t seen each other in about 30 years, and it was coincidence that my boyfriend and I moved to the same city. We could tell something was wrong the way our parent looked at each other, and they informed us that we were related. Even though we loved each other, we decided it wasn’t right to do. That was one of the hardest breakups of my life, but it had to be done for the sake of our family. I told my friends that it didn’t work out and silently removed everything from social media..\\n\\nTLDR; dated a boy from hinge for about 5 months, and discovered he was my cousin after our parents informed us while out to dinner\\n\\nEdit: Okay, too many comments about if we had sex.... and yes, your imaginations are now filled.. Throwaway because I want to cry in embarrassment. Warning... poop talk below!\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I have been dating for about 6 months and absolutely DO NOT discuss bathroom habits. Nothing. So, I can\\'t share this horrible fuck up with him so I\\'m telling it to you nasty people. \\n\\nWe\\'ve been quarantining together at his place for about a month and it\\'s been really great. Tonight, I just got finished with a run and decided to take a hot steamy shower. But first, I had to empty the tank (runners will know the feeling). After, I hop into the shower and do my thing. \\n\\nNow, I don\\'t know how you people wash your butt but here\\'s how I do it - I get the washcloth nice and sudsy, wipe down all my crevices, and then lean forward facing opposite of the shower head, spread the cheeks,  and let the water pressure get in there. Well, I must have been REALLY relaxed because next thing I know... there is poop on the bottom of the bathtub. Like a decent sized log. I didn\\'t even feel it come out. I am HORRIFIED and kind of stare at it for a few seconds wondering how this just escaped me. I quickly lean out of the shower to grab some toilet paper and guess what... the poop slithered down towards the drain! Now I have the poop stuck in the water stream and only being held up by the drain, so without thinking, I try to grab it, only for it to be smashed down and liquified even further. Fuck!!!!\\n\\nI turned the water off and grab a new piece of TP. I tried wiping the inside of the drain, but it just made it even worse. Now I added wet TP pieces to the mix. I unscrew the drain cap and let it run in the sink, only for even smaller pieces of poop to come out and get stuck in THAT drain! I repeat the process and finally get the sink drain clean. \\n\\n10 minutes pass and my boyfriend is still wondering why I\\'m in the bathroom even though the water is turned off. \\n\\nBack to the bathtub drain - I keep wiping and just keep getting more poop! Does he poop in the shower too?! There is no way this is just from me! He had some cleaner under the sink so I sprayed the living shit out of the drain and hoped it was fine. \\n\\nIt doesn\\'t stop there. All of that TP I was using? Yeah, I was tossing it into the toilet. When I finally got my drain situation under control, I flushed the toilet... only for it to be clogged with so much toilet paper. And he doesn\\'t have a plunger. So now I\\'ve been in this bathroom for a solid 40 minutes and need to explain to my boyfriend that I clogged his toilet - but not from massive shits - but from toilet paper, because I pooped in his shower (????).\\n\\nWell, I had to say something, so I left the bathroom red as a lobster and explained I accidentally flushed a tampon and it clogged the toilet so I need to run to the pharmacy to procure a plunger. \\n\\nHe believed me. \\n\\nTaking new butt washing suggestions now...\\n\\n**TLDR:** My bowels were so relaxed that I accidentally pooped in my boyfriend\\'s shower. I had a hard time hiding the evidence.\\n\\nEDIT: Since many of you need clarification... here you go. Yes, I DID poop before I showered. i thought I was all emptied out. By “decent log,” I would say it was the size of my thumb. It was a decent size for something I didn’t feel. I forgot that we all have different perspectives of what decent looks like. After reading the comments, I think what happened is that I gave myself an accidental enema. When I’m washing away, I like to get ALLLLLLLLLL the places clean, and I think the hot water jet made the bad things happen. I am a healthy person otherwise, but thank you for your concerns 😍 Happened this week and I just read another user\\'s post about breathing through one nostril and I felt inspired to share my own story.\\n\\nContext: I\\'ve had tubes in my ears my whole life, 24 of my 25 years. My childhood is filled with eat eat infections, vaccuums, drops, 6 nurses holding me down as I fought them off, and surgery. I\\'ve had 5 to 8 sets of tubes in my ears. My mom and I honestly lost count because there were just too many. My last tube set was put in when I was in 5th grade I believe. I was around 10 or 11. \\n\\nI\\'ve lived my entire life with them and they\\'ve never caused problems. In fact they\\'ve helped a few times! I feel absolutely no pressure in my ears on airplanes because the tubes equalize pressure slowing me to be fine. It\\'s awesome. \\n\\nSo here\\'s where the issues started. 4 months ago I started waking up to watery ears, which for me is a really bad sign. I ignored it because at this point in my life ENT doctors give me a lot of anxiety. But the symptoms started getting worse so last month I bit the bullet and went in. I saw the same doctor I had seen and a child. I couldn\\'t believe he was still alive! He told me I developed a polyp on my tube and it\\'s been in there so long he wants to remove it. I knew this day would come so I agreed.\\n\\nMy surgery was last Thursday and immediately post OP I realized things were off. My ear popped more times than I could count and I realize I feel air pressure now - no more carefree plane rides. My hearing was incredibly sensitive as well. Usually I blast my damn music in my car but now I drive around at 6 volume. And finally my voice has changed. The way I sound to myself it\\'s completely different to what I\\'ve come to know over the course of my life. I can\\'t really tell if I\\'m whispering or shouting just yet because I\\'ve never heard this voice before and it\\'s going to take some getting used to. The kicker is that the doctor only removed my right tube, so now my hearing feels...uneven. I guess having something in my ear canal for 24 years effected my hearing -  who would have guessed?! I genuinely did not. \\n\\nPARENTS: please remove your child\\'s ear tubes before they reach adulthood. \\n\\nEdit: Thank you for the gold! Thank you so much for the Platinum!!! Thank you for the silver!!! \\n\\nTLDR: I\\'ve lived my entire life with tubes in my ears and they were effecting my life in more ways than I realized. [Original Post and TIFU](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/e6aso0/tifu_by_accidentally_ghosting_great_first_date/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)\\n\\nHi Reddit! As promised, here is a follow-up! I found him! \\n\\nAnd ironically, Reddit had nothing to do with the reconnection, but I appreciate how sweet and supportive the Reddit community has been in trying to help me.\\n\\n# So here\\'s the full story:\\n\\nI tried the GPS-spoofing Tinder hack so many of you suggested and was able to land my account in Gangnam, Seoul where I initially was when I matched with him. But to my dismay, I couldn\\'t find him at all. I narrowed down my options to his age-range, but it still didn\\'t work. My index finger was swiping left constantly, that I felt like a broken record. I swiped left on hundreds of guys until eventually, there were no more matches to be found.\\n\\nSo I finally decide to replay the entire date over again in my head and suddenly recall my date explaining how he signed up for a language exchange app to learn English and how he\\'s an active member. I didn\\'t recall the name of the app, but it was a total big-brained move that I didn\\'t utilize the power bequeathed before my very hands, which was google. So now, with a million fewer IQ points, I search \"language exchange apps popular in Korea\" and was presented with a few options. Immediately one of the icons displayed looked very familiar! *\"That\\'s the one\",* I thought, \"t*hat\\'s the app that he showed me during our date\".* I rushed to the app store to download the app and impatiently fill out the prompts to create a new account. I selected the \"want to learn Korean\" and \"want to teach English\" options. Finally, I was done creating my profile. The app told me it would take up to 7 days to approve of my account, so I can start finding language exchange partners.  Since this was my only lead left, I unwillingly played the waiting game. \\n\\nAn hour later, I receive a notification that my account was approved! I rushed to the app and nervously scanned the Korean profiles that popped up in my feed.  There were profiles after profiles of teen girls with straight black hair and wispy bangs trying to emulate their favorite k-pop idol, or middle-aged guys with unflattering selfie angles, but none of them was the guy I was looking for. I was a bit dejected but found out that the premium subscription allowed me to search for specific users. I fidget around, trying to find my date from the free user\\'s list, but was finding very little luck with that method. I caved in, shelling out the $20 for the premium subscription, justifying that it makes sense to pay for it because at least I\\'ll get to practice speaking different languages. (although that was just an excuse to hopefully rekindle with him). Once my transaction was complete, I accessed the search bar and typed in his Tinder alias. My reasoning was that since his actual, Korean, name is so common (think John Smith), he wouldn\\'t put it on the app. I held my breath, waiting for the results to show up... but no results were found. I was slightly disappointed but did not lose hope. Maybe by a stroke of luck, searching by his Korean name would work? I was doubtful, but grasping at whichever straws I had left. From past experience, searching up his Korean name on facebook gave me more than a hundred results, but none of them were him. I typed in his Korean name and pressed enter. I resumed holding my breath and prayed that this would work. The words \"2 results\" popped up on my screen. I frantically looked at the results. The first profile was a buff dude with a gnarly bleached blonde goatee. \"*Not my guy,\"* I dismissed*.* Then I quickly glimpsed at the second profile and my eyes widened and my heart froze. It was *him.* It was the guy I so desperately tried to find this past week. \\n\\nI clicked on his profile, but suddenly, my anxiety kicked in. *What if I message him and he thinks I\\'m too desperate and is turned off?* I panicked but forced myself to initiate a message anyways. Like what was I going to say? \"*Hey sorry for ghosting you for a week, are we gucci?\"  What if he\\'s mad? What if he doesn\\'t like me anymore?* I took a deep breath to clear my mind and tried to articulately explain my situation in a few sentences. I repeatedly revised and deleted parts of my opening message before I finally decided to take the dive and hit send.\\n\\nThen it was playing the waiting game again. One perk about being a premium member on this app was that you got to see when users are active. After a few minutes, the app said he was active right now. \"*Great*\", I thought optimistically, *\"he\\'ll message me soon, and we\\'ll clear up all misunderstandings\"*. Minutes went by and he didn\\'t respond. *That\\'s okay, maybe he\\'s in a conversation with someone else...* Several minutes turned into an hour, and one hour turned into two hours. My stomach churned. Maybe I really did FU by not being cautious enough with my messaging apps. I mean, what kind of sick psychological game was this, making me receive a taste of my own medicine?\\n\\nEvery time my phone buzzed with a notification from the language app, my ears perked up a bit. But it was always some middle-aged guy propositioning me for sex or a white dude with yellow fever trying to use the new pickup lines he learned in Japanese. Occasionally, I\\'d get a wholesome friend request from someone genuinely trying to learn English, but nevertheless, out of all the 32 messages I received, none were from my date. Yet, I gave him the benefit of the doubt from experiencing how overwhelming the app could be within those 2 hours. I changed my language exchange profile to exactly mirror my Tinder profile and put my language exchange profile on high visibility mode so that he would notice it. Suddenly, I got an influx of messages from various users in addition to the Reddit notifications from my previous TIFU. I couldn\\'t stand it and temporarily muted all my notifications on my phone and headed to class for 4 hours. After class, I was ready to cut my losses and understood if my date didn\\'t want to contact me again. However, I decided to open up the app after class and check my messages, not expecting anything to happen. But still, within me was a nestled hope, that he still wanted to reach out to me.\\n\\nAnd there it was, nestled within all the other messages was an unread message from my date. Even though I said I was ready to cut my losses just a few minutes before, I couldn\\'t help but squeal. I couldn\\'t stop my smiling and did an excitement lap around the hallway outside my classroom. He seemed genuinely **happy** that I found him again and that he could keep in contact with **me**! I was jumping for joy on the way back home. We resumed our conversation from the week before as if nothing happened!\\n\\nLater in the day, he called me (through the language app), and we talked about our crazy weeks. I\\'m just so glad to have found him again and talk to him about various topics. I don\\'t need some crazy intense romcom-esque relationship, I\\'m just content with just keeping in contact and seeing what goes from there!\\n\\n**TL;DR:** Found my date I  accidentally ghosted on a language exchange app after relentless searching because my brain decided to remember something important.\\n\\nI want to thank Reddit for putting the effort into helping me find the guy! Your support helped me gain the courage to take the extra step into searching for him <3\\n\\nEdit: apparently the app I used doesn’t need premium to search for users. Fml, I’m out of $20\\n\\nEdit 2: I THINK HE READ THE POST, HE’S ASKING ME ODDLY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS. ABORT\\n\\nEdit 3: False alarm, he just added my alternate (non banned) Kakao account because apparently he literally has no other social media. We talked more and he said he was afraid I hated him after ghosting him LOL. He reconfirmed that he had a great time on our date! I decided to stop being a scared b*tch and told him I was glad to have met him again. We’re supposed to video call tomorrow! Yay This didnt happen today, but on the day before Christmas eve. For some back story, I am 30 weeks pregnant and had some serious complications that I had to be air transferred to a hospital 6 hours from my home and had to spend a week in this unfamiliar hospital to be monitored as the doctors were afraid I was going to give birth far earlier than expected. My boyfriend and I spent over a week stuck in the hospital and when I was finally deemed safe to go back home, especially right before the holidays, we were ecstatic.\\n\\nIt was about a 6 hour drive home back to our city, and after a long drive and an even longer week of being confined to the hospital.  We got home around 10pm, and settled in for a night of relaxation with our cats and Netflix. Due to complications of my pregnancy, we are unable to have penetrative intercourse but we were both feeling frisky so he went down on me, gave me a few O\\'s and of course I was happy to return the favor. So there I am, with a mouthful of dick, eagerly giving him some very enthusiastic head and he comes. As I pull my mouth away, I realise I couldnt swallow. I then also realise my mouth is stuck open. This has happened before, sometimes while yawning most often but I usually can click my jaw back into place easily. This time felt different.\\n\\nI panic, run straight to the bathroom and sure enough, my jaw is wide open, enough to fit probably 4 fingers between my top and bottom teeth. My boyfriend rushes in and I tried to explain the situation but I could barely speak due to my jaw being stuck open so wide. He quickly realised, obviously by just looking at me and we start frantically googling methods to fix it, he even called Teleheath and they told him we needed to go to the hospital. I was crying hysterically, after spending over a week in the hospital I did NOT want to have to go back. Unfortunately, nothing was helping and I was in excruciating pain so I caved in and we headed to emerge.\\n\\nAt the hospital, the emergency room was PACKED. We were informed there was only one doctor on for the night and the wait was an anticipated 9-12 hours. We had no choice. My boyfriend thoughtfully got me one of those face masks to cover your mouth usually for coughing because my jaw was hinged open and I was pouring drool that I wasnt able to swallow. We spent a whopping 13 hours waiting to be seen by a doctor. By the time I was finally seen, I was in the worst pain I have ever been in. Then I had to embarassingly explain how it all happened. After that ridiculous wait, the doctor carefully put a hand on either side of my jaw, pushing one side while pulling the other side and an immediate clicking noise happened and I realised my mouth had closed!\\n\\nThe relief was amazing and I was crying tears of pure relief. He diagnosed me with TMJ and basically said I\\'d have to get jaw surgery after my pregnancy is over and sent me on my merry way after giving me a tip on how to try and adjust the jaw myself if it ever were to happen again.\\n\\nTLDR: sucked some dick, got my jaw stuck open for 13 hours and had to lie to my family at Christmas dinner about why I spent 13 hours in emerge. (We told them I yawned too wide, spoiler, no one believed us.) I\\'m not sure I\\'m together enough yet to actually tell tell this story.\\n\\n\\nYou see... It happened about a half hour ago.  I\\'m still shaken.\\n\\n\\nI will list the pertinent facts and assume you are smart enough to construct the narrative.\\n\\n\\n--I am the stay at home full time caregiver for my father.\\n\\n\\n--he is a fat man\\n\\n\\n--my mom is here too.... But she is tiny and not strong enough to move him.\\n\\n\\n--sometimes my dad has to pee in the middle of the night.\\n\\n\\n--they are too nice to wake me up for this.\\n\\n\\n--my mom grabs a big cup and helps dad while they are both lying down.\\n\\n\\n--usually she dumps the cup in the toilet. No problems.\\n\\n\\n--moms getting old, sometimes forgets, and simply left the full cup on the living room coffee table.\\n\\n\\n--mom often finishes her day with a big glass of lemonade.\\n\\n\\n--she usually leaves whatever is leftover in that cup on the coffee table.\\n\\n\\n--last night I had a few drinks.\\n\\n\\n--I woke up early to check on dad.\\n\\n\\n--I was thirsty from drinking the night before.\\n\\n--I saw what I thought was her lemonade on the coffee table\\n\\n\\n--I took a big chug.\\n\\n\\n--I was able vomit quietly so as not to wake mom and dad.\\n\\n\\n--my stomach has calmed down\\n\\n\\n--but I\\'m not sure my world will ever be the same\\n\\n\\nTL;DR - I drank my dad\\'s pee. I vomited a whole lot. So basically I was in class with one of my friends who takes the same subject, he was super energetic and always wearing semi-formal clothing.\\n\\nThis is in my relaxed electronics class where everyone moves around and is always chatting away. So, it\\'s mufiday and look over at my friend who was leaning over a desk with his ass sticking out, while he was talking to another student. \\n\\nSo I go up and with a huge wind up, slap his ass so hard that he immediately jumps up, as if he\\'s just jumped out of his own skin. \\n\\nYou see, the problem with that was that the person I slapped was not actually my friend... but our teacher. \\n\\nEveryone is at a stand still, waiting for my death penelty, especially my friend whose just staring my down at this point. Now the teacher\\'s face goes bright red, and I\\'m starting to freak out thinking I\\'m doomed. \\n\\nExcept, the teacher just sits down, looks me in the eyes and says, \"Hewy (not my real name but username will do). Save that for after class\" with a big grin on his face.\\n\\nEveryone at this point bursts out laughing as I\\'m sitting here absolutely shitting my pants thinking I was about to get kicked out of school. \\n\\nGod, I love my teach hahaha\\n\\nTL;DR\\nI was having a good day in class, when I mistakingly slapped my teachers ass and get totally embarrassed by the comment he makes at the end of it. In every single customer service job I\\'ve ever been in, the job has required me to lie to a customer, for reasons ranging from legal liability to making the company more money. Sometimes it was a harmless little fudge, sometimes a great big whopper with real consequences. For one example, working for Diwrecked-TV had me lying so much I could have been Pinocchio\\'s twin brother, and I\\'m ashamed to say the incentives for doing so were enough that I got *very good* at lying my face off.\\n\\nI like my current job well enough, and they\\'ve generally been good enough to me, that I made the foolish mistake of thinking \"they might be different this time\". So a few days ago I (correctly) stated that one potential reason someone\\'s yearly bill went up nearly 50% is because the COVID-related crisis is eating our company\\'s lunch like a playground bully.\\n\\nHahahaha NO. *Big* mistake. This morning my immediate supervisor chewed my ass like a pit bull\\'s squeaky bone, complete with CC\\'ing it to the Big Cheese (asshole!) and a form to sign. Henceforth I am to stick to two sentences that boil down to: \"the math is hard and the numbers are right, what else can I (not) help you with?\"\\n\\nI\\'m just glad that we are still working remotely so I\\'m spared the inevitable lecture from Oscar the Grouch for my unintentional slip-up.\\n\\nTL;DR - told truth, got reamed.\\n\\n**EDIT:** R.I.P. my inbox. Did not expect this to blow up like it did. Thank you all for your awards and kind words.\\n\\n\\\\--->For everyone suggesting I change jobs<---I would be most grateful for advice/assistance in setting up myself to do freelance IT work on the side. Much as I dislike customer service, at the moment, barring a massively better primary job coming along quitting just isn\\'t an option. Disclaimer: This actually happened several years ago, but I do still feel really bad.\\n\\nI was out on a date with a girl and things were going well despite me being a nervous wreck. We got to talking and she admitted she had depression and at one point was even suicidal, but was proud of herself for getting past that chapter of her life. She then shows me her semi-colon tattoo on her wrist and explains the significance - that it means the sentence could have ended there, but the author decided to add more. It’s all very sweet and heartfelt. Now, I in no way have any issues with mental illness and still feel super guilty about this to this day, but me with a perpetual foot-in-the-mouth syndrome say “You know in programming it means end”.\\n\\nShe doesn’t say anything.\\n\\nI don’t say anything.\\n\\nSuffice to say I never got a second date.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR I told a suicidal girl who semicolon tattoo means \"end\" in programming.\\n\\nEdit: The popularity of this post is mostly just everyone telling me I’m wrong. Lol. I guess I could have given a better definition, but I also could have shut my big fat mouth. And I did in fact apologize (a bunch). She awkwardly laughed it off. A bit of context first:\\n\\nSo yesterday I was working on an assignment (due tomorrow) and my “friend” steals my USB with all of my saved work on it (because it also has games on it that he wants).This would not normally be an issue, but then goes on to copy one game and DELETE ALL OF ITS CONTENTS. I was extremely pissed and asked to see the recycle bin, which he refused to show me, then telling me later that day that he deleted it bc he’s a dickhead like that. Fortunately I still had an auto saved copy from a while back, but I still lost a lot of work.\\n\\nFast forward to today, I’m thinking how I can get him back, when I have an idea. I got one of the old COD games from my friend and set it up so that when the game folder was opened, it ran a batch command that opened a porn website over and over. I knew he would try stealing it again and couldn’t wait for him to be busted. Just when I was ready to lay the trap I went to edit the file and instead of right clicking, I opened it. My mouse cursor instantly slowed from the thousands of searches at once so i shut down my laptop. Minutes later when I had restarted my computer I got a message popup from the school IT department telling me to take my laptop up to the office. They called my parents and I got sent home and now I’m facing suspension and have to have my laptop in teacher’s view for the rest of the term. After today my phone is being confiscated until my parents believe I have learned my lesson. I guess it’s karma and all but I still wish this guy had opened it because his parents are very strong Christians and he would have copped it much worse than me.\\n\\nTL;DR: I tried to prank a classmate by getting him to open many porn tabs in class with a file command but I opened it and got myself in a load of shit.\\n\\nEdit: turns out he didn’t remove from his recycle bin, getting it back tomorrow and no hard feelings\\n\\nEdit 2: my parents ended up not confiscating my phone, but I can’t use my PC until end of term so hooray I guess\\n\\nEdit 3: For all the people asking, it was a shortcut that was made to look identical to a folder apart from a tiny arrow at the bottom so that it ran the command on click. Sorry for not clarifying\\n\\nEdit 4: I apologize for not knowing how to spell batch lol This story happened in 2004, I\\'m posting it because I was asked to by my family. This story is told all the time in my life by my parents, so I hope you enjoy it.\\n\\nI\\'m British with a Welsh dad and Portuguese mum. Mum wanted me raised to not be a stereotypical British teenager sneaking out lying about going to a mates house and passing out from drinking vodka in a field, so she got me drinking tiny amounts of wine at dinner time from the age of 5/6. We\\'re talking a shot of wine, no more. They learned their lesson after I got shitfaced aged 5 off of brandy (story in the comments).\\n\\nMe being autistic got super into this and wanted to try all the different red wines we had, and I asked lots of questions. It became a little special interest of mine when I was 8. For those who are unfamiliar, if you\\'re not baptised into the church as a baby, you can do a combo baptism/first holy communion as a kid through Catholic school. I did this in primary school so I would have a place at the best secondary school in my city, which happened to be Catholic.\\n\\nLike weddings, you have a dress rehearsal for the first holy communion, with the priest. It\\'s a whole goddamn mass, except instead of 300 people in the bigass church, it\\'s the 10 or 20 people in the ceremony and family/godparents to be as well. So being a dress rehearsal, there\\'s a full communion with the wine and wafers to be Top Lad Jesus\\' blood and body.\\n\\nI was doing so good at being a normal kid during the ceremony until this part. Then it was Special Interest Activation Mode. See the priest doesn\\'t really expect kids having communion to drink the wine, they expect you to hold the goblet and give it back. Well, not me, and not this time - I swirled that goblet, sniffed it, said \"wait this is familiar\", had a sip, SHRIEKED, and turned to my parents jumping yelling \"MUM, DAD, THIS IS BLOSSOM HILL! IT\\'S THAT GRENACHE WE HAD LAST WEEK!!\"\\n\\nMy parents have never been so fucking humiliated in their lives. We bailed the rehearsal, was told to be silent during the real one, and shortly moved churches. I think the priest thought I had the devil in me and was some alcoholic kid, because the bastard tried to drown me during the official baptism and there\\'s a video of me coughing my guts up lmao.\\n\\nTl;dr: my parents got me an autistic kid to develop a special interest in wine which bit them in the ass when I got baptised and had my first communion at church.\\n\\n---‐‐------------\\n\\nEDIT: Due to a comment bug the brandy story is an addendum here.\\n\\nBrandy story:\\n\\nWhen I was 5, I kept getting recurrent bronchitis. It lasted over 6 months, the antibiotics just weren\\'t curing it and they had to keep getting stronger ones.\\n\\nIt tasted of fake banana and the texture of it was giving me autistic meltdowns. My dad could not rationalise a 5 year old to keep taking the antibiotics so he started experimenting to try and make it palatable.\\n\\nFirst he added sugar. Still gross. Then fruit squash. Still gross. Tried another batch with fruit juice. Even worse.\\n\\nAt this point he was losing the will to live and probably losing interest in me living and so desperate times call for desperate measures. The final form of this Ring of Fire bronchitis medicine, the secret ingredient: brandy. Lots of brandy.\\n\\nDid I like it? Hell no, but it knocked me out cold so it gave him the goddamn peace and quiet he wanted. TL:DR: Accidentally added \"WAP\" to my workplace playlist. Song played at work. Let\\'s just say If the customers in the store didn\\'t what \"WAP\" stood for, they definitely did by the time we managed to turn it off.\\n\\nI’m a key holder at a children’s toy store. We have two CDs that we’re allowed to play that have songs deemed “suitable” for the store. One of the CDs is your typical kids’ sing-alongs, “Wheels on the Bus”, “Old MacDonald\\'\\', all that jazz. The other is this weird folk CD that has the worst rendition of “Oh, Canada!” I have heard in my life. So naturally, I made a playlist on Spotify with family-friendly tunes that I could put on when my manager wasn’t there that didn’t make my brain turn to mush and dribble out my ears. \\n\\nThis morning before my shift, I wanted to update the work playlist as it was getting a little stale so I did the quick add option that allows you to go through your liked songs and just click them to add them to the selected playlist. Awesome, great, gonna have some fresh tunes to get me through my closing shift.\\n\\nI’m at work, about two hours in and my coworker tells me her till needs a drop (there’s too much money in the till and I have to open it and count out $200). While I do this, the back room (where my phone is connected to the store speakers) is locked to prevent anyone going in and waiting for me back there when I bring the cash back to the safe. \\n\\nSo I\\'m counting an insane amount of 5 dollar bills when all of the sudden the speakers start blaring “WHORES IN THIS HOUSE, THERE’S SOME WHORES IN THIS HOUSE” and my blood runs cold. Oh my ever-loving fuck, I added “WAP” to a children store’s playlist. I look up and see looks of horror on the faces of women and innocent children. \\n\\nI panic and go to shut the till so I can run and turn off the music but remember my manager telling me that if I shut the till without taking out the correct amount of money, I would be in a world of trouble. In her words exactly, “Everything comes second to the handling of cash.” And I wasn’t about to call my manager and tell her that it had to come 2nd to Cardi B talking about her “wet ass pussy”. So I start yelling for my coworker to grab the keys from around my neck and open the backroom door. She grabs the keys and sprints to the backroom door but yells back that she doesn’t know what key it is. I describe it to her and she tries it but says it’s not working. I’m furiously counting the money but the panic is making it hard to keep track of how much I’m actually taking. \\n\\nFinally, my coworker gets into the backroom and turns off the music but not before Megan Thee Stallion has the pleasure of informing us all that “If he ate my ass, he’s a bottom feeder”. \\n\\nI quickly finish counting the cash and make sure of the amount before I do what can only be called the Walk-of-Shame to the backroom, avoiding eye contact with all the angry mothers in the store. I get back there and see that I did in fact add “WAP” to the store playlist. I give myself a moment to breathe before putting on my best customer service voice and speaking over the intercom, \\n\\n“Good Evening, Customers. On behalf of \\\\[STORE NAME\\\\], I would like to apologize for the technical difficulties. We hope to make it up to you by offering free gift wrapping on unlimited items\\\\*. Thank you and have a fantastical night.”\\n\\n\\\\*Gift wrapping is already free.\\n\\nLet’s just say I welcomed back “Oh, Canada!” with open arms after this. To be upfront, this did not happen today, but rather exactly one year ago today. I was reminded by my friends\\' snapchat memories of this absolutely awful experience one year ago.\\n\\nSo I\\'m a junior in college now (I was a sophomore then) and I work for a club on campus that raises money for a charity that gives money to families of children with cancer to ease the financial burden of things like hospital bills and hotel rooms for treatment, etc. At the end of the year, we throw a 10-hour long concert which usually involves a lot of student DJs doing quick sets to pass the time.\\n\\nAnyways, we needed someone to fill in for a half hour set, so I thought, \"why not?\" and plugged my laptop in, ran some cheap DJ software, and played some pop music off a playlist. All is well, right?\\nWell, as it turns out, all was not not well. I was unknowingly playing \"Die Young\" by Kesha which contains the lyrics:\\n>Let\\'s make the most of the night like we\\'re gonna die young // We\\'re gonna die young // We\\'re gonna die young\\n\\nNot long after, I got a text from my friend and the conversation went something like:\\n> dude change the song // ??? // you\\'re playing die young // and? // the kids are here // oh fuck\\n\\nI look around and everyone is staring at me thinking this is some cruel joke because all of the patients we sponsor are at the event. I quickly changed to \"I Gotta Feeling\" and all was well. Luckily, none of the kids were listening too closely and didn\\'t get upset. I got a stern talking to by the club advisors, but they ended up letting me go because they couldn\\'t prove that I played it on purpose. That night, we ended up raising $121,000, so... silver linings, right?\\n\\nTL;DR: I played a pre-set playlist at a children\\'s cancer fundraiser. Kesha\\'s \"Die Young\" came on. Got a talking to.\\n\\nEDIT: Realized I probably shouldn\\'t include the name of the charity in this post.\\n\\nEDIT 2: hijacking my own post to try to turn these upvotes into some donations to the charity. If you’re interested in giving, ~~here is the link.~~\\n\\nEDIT 3: Decided to remove the charity again to not violate Rule 5. If you feel strongly about donating, PM me. This actually happened some time ago but thinking about it is still quite painful.. I was in uni and made friend with this really cute girl in my senior year at an event. We got on well and I was really thinking about asking her out, but since this happened quite close to graduation and she might be going back to her home country I decided to keep in all inside and not doing anything. I thought that asking her to stay just 3 months after us knowing each other is too big of a favor to ask, so I kept it strictly friend between us so that out farewell would not be too painful.\\n\\nIn the graduation she decided to give me a gift of homemade chocolate in a very nice box that she made herself. It was all a blur but I kinda recalled her asking me to open it at home and let her know what I think. Well it was a very emotional moment for me and it is kinda her farewell gift to me so idiot me decided NOT to open it and kept it in the fridge (it was a very nice box that she made herself too so that is another reason). We met again after a few days at her farewell party, there were some emotional moment but I was prepared and considered that was it.\\n\\nThe box stayed in my fridge for I dont know how long, maybe 1.5-2 years? She went home and after a year dated somebody else and got married, and I also met somebody else. One day I was cleaning the fridge and saw the box again and decided that maybe it is time to throw it away. Chocolate has probably gone bad but curiously I still decided to open it, and my heart shrunk then I saw a full page note from her. She basically poured her heart out and said how much feeling she had for me, and wondering if something could happened between us.\\n\\nI just felt so bad afterwards but decided to just keep it to myself. I probably looked like an asshole for how I acted when I last saw her, but she seems very much happy now and so am I..\\n\\nTL;DR: Got a gift from a girl I really liked but decided not to open it after 1.5 years, totally ignoring her note for me hidden inside. Throwaway because I don\\'t want this to be on my main account:\\n\\n\\nObbligatory \"This didn\\'t happen today but happened last week yadda yadda yadda\"\\n\\nAlso please forgive my spelling mistakes because I\\'m in the hospital and writing this on mobile out of boredom of there being not much to do here.\\n\\nSo, last week I was driving casually on the country road close to my house on holiday back home for the summer after my second year of college. I wasn\\'t paying too much attention (I assume some responsibility) and wasn\\'t wearing a seat belt. Yes I\\'m an idiot I know lesson learned. WEAR YOUR SEAT BELTS KIDS! Anyway, it was just starting to rain and I saw a KID ABOUT TO GO INTO THE ROAD. For the life of me I still don\\'t know why he thought it would he a good idea to go onto a quite highly trafficked country road so casually, but eh life is full of surprises. I was caught completely off guard and swerved into the opposing lane to avoid him, and promptly got hit head on by the car coming towards me.\\n\\nNow, I was going quite fast and as I said, did not have a seat belt on. Next thing I knew I was out of my car and couldn\\'t feel anything anymore. No pain, no panic, nothing. I just saw blood and felt the biggest adrenaline rush I\\'ve ever had in my life. I just laid there, not knowing what to do. I heard voices come towards me but didn\\'t really know what they were saying, and couldn\\'t really respond. I thought I was going to die. There was a lot of blood.\\n\\nYou know how they say your life flashes before your eyes when you\\'re about to die? Well that didn\\'t quite happen but I did start thinking about who I care about and who I love. Here\\'s where I tell you about my best friend. A girl I\\'ve been in love with for around two years, I never let her know and never intended too. She is in a happy relationship she\\'s had since her teens and I didn\\'t want to ruin it, and if she\\'s happy I\\'m happy. There\\'s no point meddling in things bigger than you and some things aren\\'t meant to be. But I thought I was literally dying, and all I could think about was her in those moments. The pain was starting to kick in but I was just thinking about how she\\'d never know how much I loved her.\\n\\nI realised my phone was still in my pocket, and with all the force I could muster I took it out. It was intact and it felt like it took ages but the only message I could sent was an \"I love you\" to her. I thought that would be the last message I\\'d ever send.\\n\\nI don\\'t remember much after that. Days have been a blur. I\\'ve had quite a few operations, AKI due to trauma and a ruptured spleen. But my legs are starting to work again and my face looks like I got in a fight with a lion but it\\'s slowly improving! All I do is sleep and appreciate the fact I\\'m alive. The other driver and the kid were okay btw.\\nAnyway, as you can see, I did indeed live and didn\\'t die (so far), but I can\\'t undo that message I sent. I\\'ve been in a lot of pain this past week, and haven\\'t had the energy to confront the situation. I told her about the accident, and what happened, and we talked briefly but mainly about my lovely hospital experience. Earlier today she sent me a message telling me we have to talk about that message. I haven\\'t replied yet and I don\\'t want to. I don\\'t know what to do. So far I\\'ve been writing this TIFU as procrastination and then after this I plan on taking a long nap. Thank you all for your attention, nap time calls me.\\n\\n\\n\\nTLDR: Got in a car accident and while I was bleeding out I told my crush best friend I love her. She\\'s in a 10 year relationship and I haven\\'t talked to her about it since and it\\'s destroying me.\\n\\n\\n\\nEDIT: GOD GUYS THIS BLEW UP SO MUCH!!! I only wrote this to procrastinate the inevitable conversation you guys are amazing jeez thanks for all the advice and support!!\\n\\nSo I spoke to her... Over the phone because we\\'re college friends and she lives far away right now. I decided that the best thing I could do at this point was just tell her the truth. I didn\\'t expect anything and I didn\\'t want anything to come out of it, but I just thought that to have a pure and true friendship everything needs to be out there or it just wouldn\\'t be legitimate. I would love to tell you guys an amazing fairytail story that would give you guys all hope for the future and whatnot, but I guess life is just different from movies...\\n\\nI told her how I felt in pretty much the same words as in this post. But I also added, and it\\'s true, that I\\'ve gotten to know her boyfriend for the past few years and he\\'s great. I don\\'t want to hurt him or interfere as much as I want her happy. I think she understood where I came from and the circumstances in which those words were said. I hope nothing will change with her because I love spending time with her and neither of us can immagine life without eachother anymore, we both admitted that. So I guess I just have to give you the boring response... But it\\'s reality so sorry if it sucks... Im okay with though, I really didn\\'t expect anything and still kind of think I was being selfish. We talked about a lot of other things like we normally do for a couple of hours after that and she might be coming to visit me in the hospital this weekend! She said she\\'ll try and make the trip, even though I told her not to because it\\'s gonna be extremely expensive for her last minute... She was really flattered though I think and almost cried thinking she was the last thing I thought about when I thought I was going to die This just happened 2 hours ago.\\n\\n\\nI work for an IT company that services many small/medium businesses. I\\'m in an office with about 8-10 other technicians. We like playing pranks and any time one of our techs leaves their computer unlocked, we change their background to weird stuff.\\n\\n\\nI had just got out of a meeting and realized the new guy left his PC unlocked. I sneaked around to his cubicle since he was just on the other side talking to another guy. I quickly pulled up IE and googled \"sexy pikachu\". Found [the one](http://0.media.collegehumor.cvcdn.com/43/92/289186d67dc19661daf4a44b700f343a.jpg), right clicked, and set as background. Then I went back in to background settings and set it to tile across his screen. Standard stuff.\\n\\n\\nI quickly sneak back to my computer without being detected and wait for him to sit back down and notice. He notices right away and we have a good laugh about it. Then he says, \"Hey, I\\'m remoted into a client\\'s computer. You changed their background, not mine.\"\\n\\n\\nI shit you not, at that very moment, another tech walks up with a goofy ass grin and says, \"Hey, I have Jane Doe on the phone. She says someone put something inappropriate on one of her computers and she wants to talk to someone about it.\" Jane Doe happens to be the main point of contact and decision maker for that particular client. I also believe she\\'s the owner\\'s daughter. At first, we think our coworker is fuckin with us, but he\\'s not. He\\'s just basking in the moment of instant karma. \\n\\n\\nI stand there for a good 30 seconds before I say \"Ok, send her over to me.\" I\\'m a director and I have a working relationship with Jane Doe, so it\\'s really best I talk to her.\\n\\n\\nI answer the phone. I listen to what she has to say. She had a mixture of confusion and anger in her voice. She attempts to describe what she felt like was an inappropriate background on a new PC and she wants to know what\\'s going on. I tell her that one of our techs tried to prank another tech by changing his background, not realizing they were connected to a client. I apologize for it, I tell her the tech will be reprimanded and that it won\\'t happen again. Thankfully, that was a sufficient enough response and she let it go. I hang up the phone and slap my left hand with my right while calling myself a d-bag.  I\\'ve spent the last 2 hours getting my balls busted by my coworkers saying things like \"Hey, I\\'m locking my computer for you\" or \"Hey, I\\'m remoted into a client computer, do you want to change the background?\"\\n\\n\\nTL;DR Tried to change coworker\\'s desktop background to Sexy Pikachu, accidentally changed it on a client\\'s PC he was connected to instead. Main point of contact for that client saw the background and immediately called in wanting to talk to a manager. Am manager.\\n\\nEdit 12/11/2020: Link to pic no longer works. This is it: https://www.deviantart.com/nancher/art/Pikachu-sexy-version-159235080 This just happened and I am still wishing it didn’t.   My  15 year old son and I are home, I’m working on a puzzle and making dinner, he is playing Fortnite.   He disappears for a little while and I go to find him.    I didn’t really need him for anything, just wanted to say ‘hi’ since we had both been doing our own things for most of the day.\\n\\nI start walking down the hallway towards his room—our house isn’t super big and I knew he was in there.   The lights in both the hallway and his room were off and it was pretty dark in the hall, but I could see the light from his phone and knew he was lying on his bed looking at his phone.\\n\\nI decided to be funny and flip on the light and flop down on his bed.   He was lying with his back to me, I could tell by where his phone was.   As I am airborne, leaping over him onto the far side of his bed, I see it.   My son’s boner.   As I was flipping on the light, he was rolling towards the door while pulling up his underwear and grabbed a blanket.   It all happened so fast and I was already airborne before I realized what was happening.   I did not see actual flesh, but definitely saw my teenaged son’s boner through his boxer briefs.   \\n\\nThe entire situation was horrifying, for both of us, I’m sure.   I have no idea what he was looking at on his phone, AND I DON’T WANT TO.\\n\\nAt that point, I am still flopped down on his bed.   Both of us are well aware that I just saw him whacking off.    Both of us figuring out how to get the fuck out of there.   I say, ‘Dinner is almost ready.’   (It wasn’t)\\nHe said, ‘Ok, I’ll be out in a minute.’\\nI said, ‘No hurry.’\\n\\nNow I’m standing in my kitchen, typing furiously to reddit and wondering how much therapy he’ll need if he ever finds out I posted about this to a bunch of strangers and wondering WHY DON’T BOYS CLOSE THE DOOR WHEN THEY ARE MASTURBATING?  \\n\\ntl/dr:   Basically the title.     \\n\\nEdit: spelling.   Dammit, I can’t change the spelling of ‘masturbating’ in the title.   Oh well.   I fixed ‘Fortnite’ though.   \\n\\nEdit 2:  for those asking:\\n\\n—I am mom.\\n—I want to be clear, I have absolutely no issue with him jerking off.   I am a nurse.   I talk to my boys openly about sex, drugs, alcohol, etc.   The horrifying part is that I walked in on him.   That was not ideal.  For either one of us.  \\n—his door was OPEN.  \\n—I have obviously learned my lesson and will knock all the way down the hall, send smoke signals, text him, wear bells on my shoes, etc, before I walk into his room, door open or not, from this point forward.   \\n—he isn’t on any social media.   I am quite confident that his identity is protected.\\n\\nEdit 3:   For anyone still interested...\\n\\nTHANK YOU (almost) everyone for taking this as it was:  an embarrassing moment which has most definitely taught both my son and I lessons about boundaries and privacy.    \\n\\nWOW.   I now know what ‘RIP my inbox’ feels like.   I had no idea reddit would be so into my awkward moment.\\n\\nFor those who sent creepy shit to my inbox, just no.\\n\\nAnd an update:   There is no weirdness.   We went straight back to the status quo, had dinner and just continued about our night.   I didn’t act weird and neither did he.    A little background my wife and I just recently had a baby and due to that it has been a couple months since my wife and I have been intimate. She is normally very timid and self conscious about her body despite being in great shape (her body returned to Pre-baby weight almost immediately) and being a beautiful woman. \\n\\nThe other night I hopped on my computer and browsed the internet in the evening as my wife fed the baby and put her to sleep. She came out in the living room asked what I was up to, I told her not much just gonna play a game or two with some friends. She said that sounded fun and then started tidying up a little. My attention then turned to my game with my friends. The lights were very dim in the room and I had headphones on. I hear a noise just slightly above the noise in my ears and look over my shoulder to see my wife sitting on the couch in the dimly lit room. “You’re sneaky I didn’t hear you come in” I say. She says yeah I guess. I then turn back to the game about to begin. \\n \\nHalfway though the match my phone lights up with a text from my wife. “Glad to know what you really think!” I had no clue what she was talking about. I fire off a “Huh?” Text. I quickly get up to go see what she’s talking about. I find her curled up in bed sobbing. I climb up next her and ask her what’s wrong and what the text meant. “ you know exactly what I mean”. I still have no clue as to what’s going on. After a little bit more probing  she tells me through tears, “ I wanted to have a fun evening with you. I put on lingerie and laid out all the  stuff for sex (towel, lubes, etc...), I come out to couch all dressed up and you look right at me and go right back to your game. “\\n\\nI honestly was shocked by all of this. The monitor was super bright and I could all but make out the silhouette of her when she came out. I tried to explain that to her but honestly what could I say in that moment. Finally convinced her that I could not see anything when she came out. She was still frustrated and a little sad but now I’m slowly making my way out of the doghouse. \\n\\nTLDR\\nCouldn’t see wife come in and try seduce me and turned around  and started playing video games with my friends Throwaway account for obvious reasons. This just happened a few minutes ago. I was laying on my couch and my cat decided to jump up and lay on my chest as he often does. I had just eaten lunch, which was a chicken salad sandwich, so naturally my cat was intrigued by the smell and wanted to get a good whiff. He was sniffing around my face heavily, almost comically. I was feeling pretty generous at that time so I got the brilliant idea to open my mouth really wide to let him enjoy, but also because I was curious how far he would venture in. You know, normal pet owner stuff. He got his head about halfway in when suddenly he decided to let out a violent and very wet sneeze right into my mouth. I\\'m fucking disgusted, and the weekend has been ruined before it even started. \\n\\nTL;DR: My cat sneezed directly in my mouth. TIFU big time by trying to do my job....well, not specifically today.  This is an old story, but then again I\\'m an old man.\\n\\nAbout 30-some odd years ago, when I was in my early 20\\'s, I worked for a newspaper as the assistant district manager. One part of my job that I was doing then was to go around and make sure that the paperboys (remember them) picked up their delivered bundles of newspapers for delivery.\\n\\nThis was on a Sunday morning and I had to drive around to all the drop-off spots. And there it was...a bundle of newspapers still sitting out undelivered. I looked in my little booklet of paperboys and saw the name and address of the boy who was supposed to get them. No issue. He probably overslept and I just needed to wake him up.\\n\\nI went to the house and knocked on the door. A woman in her 40\\'s answered the door.\\n\\nMe: \"Hi. Is Paperboy there? He hasn\\'t picked up his newspapers and they need to go out!\"\\n\\nThe woman then solemnly looked me in the eye. The 16-year old boy who I was asking about had hung himself in his own closet the previous day and was gone. She was a neighbor who was staying with the family to help them.\\n\\nI felt about 1 inch tall.\\n\\nI don\\'t remember what exactly I said to her, but I apologized for the interruption and waking everyone, gave my intense sympathy to her, and backed away with my tail between my legs. I then contacted my boss for a copy of the customer list and delivered those newspapers myself for the next few days.\\n\\nIt was awful!\\n\\nI know that I had no way of knowing, but I defy anyone who has something like that happen not to feel like the cosmos should have presented us with divine knowledge to not get into this!!! I didn\\'t stay in that position for too much longer.\\n\\nTL;DR Tried to wake up a paperboy only to find he died; tried to apologize my way out This happened a few hours ago in a busy buffet restaurant in a hotel in Austria.\\n\\nBeing a buffet restaurant, people were pretty much always wandering from table to food and back again, so there was a constant steam of mainly Austrian and German people passing our table. We’ve been here a few days, you start to recognise people and my two young sons have made a few friends.\\n\\nI was joking with the kids  that I’d left their Nintendo Switch at home, they suspected I was joking but went along with it anyway. So when I told them I had brought it they wanted to check.\\n\\n“I brought it,” I said \\n\\n“Our Switch?”\\n\\n“Yes, Our Switch”\\n\\n“What?!! OUR Switch?!”\\n\\n“Yes!! OUR Switch!!”\\n\\nThey got louder and we started just repeating it, laughing. I noticed my wife frowning at me, or past me, it didn’t really register.\\n\\n“OUR SWITCH?”\\n\\n“OUR SWITCH! Ha!”\\n\\nThen my wife really started signalling to me to shut up - I was like “it’s ok... it’s a buffet”\\n\\n“OUR SWITCH! Ha!”\\n\\n“OUR SWITCH!”\\n\\nThen my wife leaned in and urgently whispered “it sounds like you are all shouting Auschwitz”\\n\\nMy whole body went cold with the realisation.\\n\\nNeedless to say I immediately stopped, placed my hand on my eldest son’s knee and he - seeing the look on my face-  stopped straight away - the 3 year old did one final shout before I could stop him... \\n\\nI have avoided eye contact with all other hotel guests since. \\n\\nTLDR: Shouted “Auschwitz” loudly, happily, repeatedly,  in a restaurant full of Germans and Austrians. I’m really sorry.\\n\\nEDIT: thank you for the gold and silver kind strangers! My first. To those calling BS: I wish it was. To the genial Germans and Austrians assuring me of the reduced risk of horror due to pronunciation, sincere thanks - I will sleep better tonight because of you. And for the few offended at us shouting in a buffet: it’s a kinderhotel. Kind of like if Michael Bay did buffets.\\n\\nEDIT2: just to all my salty comrades telling me I’m a “scum cunt”, that my kids will grow up to assholes because we were loud. I fucking love you Reddit! I’m reassured that you are all so considerate when it comes to noise in public spaces. You wouldn’t like this restaurant ... stone walls, stone floors, a hotel designed for kids. It’s like a school playground where they’ve all been given metal objects to smash together but louder. Our risky exchange was lost in the cacophony to anyone who wasn’t walking past our table.. ***Background***\\n\\nI am a very passionate writer. I *had* an account that was just for writing prompts. Every week I would go to that sub and write long detailed stories.  \\n\\n***Story Time***\\n\\nLast year, on r/WritingPrompts, someone gave a prompt idea that revolved around a student who one day became rich. I forget the full details, but it intrigued me and I wrote a 6-PAGE STORY about it. Anyways, that post didn\\'t gain any traction (which sucked), but I still had a 6-page short story just sitting on that Reddit post.\\n\\n**^((It was on a different account, which is no longer alive))**\\n\\n***Present*** \\n\\nSo a few weeks ago, my writing class professor gave the class an assignment that was literally about the same idea. So I was like, okay sweet I don\\'t need to spend any time on this project. I went over to that account, copied the text, put it into a word document and submitted. To be sure I don\\'t get into any trouble, I delete the account, forgetting that it wouldn\\'t delete all my comments. \\n\\nYesterday, I get an email from the Professor saying I need to meet with the Dean immediately. At this point, I am shitting my pants. She told me that I stole someone else\\'s work and I could be withdrawn from my program. I try to explain but I have no proof that it was my work because I no longer live at home and I wrote it on an old laptop. I have a meeting with the head of the University later today. I am so fucking scared. I am currently driving home to find that fucker.  \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR: I copied and pasted my own work from my own Reddit post, which caused my assignment to show up as plagiarized. Could be withdrawn from my program\\n\\n\\nEdit 1: [17:00] I found my original work. Took me an hour of going through files on a slow laptop. Travelling back now, meeting is in 3 hours. I’m okay with taking a zero, obviously, I just hope they can reason. \\n\\nAlso, I can’t show the Reddit emails because I never had a real email for the account. \\n\\nEdit 2: SUCCESS! I brought my old laptop to the University principal and provided proof that I was the one to write the story. They were skeptical, but the dates matched up with what I told them before. They asked me why I did this and asked me to tell them why it was not okay to do this. I told them it was a lack of understanding and apologized. \\n\\n*Results*\\n\\nI am not kicked out, and I am actually given another chance at the project. My professor told me he actually enjoyed the story lol. \\n\\n\\nThanks everyone who supported me through this! I won’t do this again. I’m sorry. \\n\\n\\nAlso, thanks u/SQUID_FUCKER for the suggestion\\n\\n> Just read all the edits.  You know what you should do, is incorporate all this into the story.  If the idea is about a student getting rich all of a sudden, write a story about a student who plagiarizes a story for a writing assignment and it takes off and gets published and he becomes insanely wealthy off of it but the guilt over who the original author drives him mad.\\n\\n\\nMaybe this will be the plot of the new story.  So it was rather cold today and I put some nice, thick wool socks on my 4 year old son.  After running around a bit today, he came and gave me a hug.... Zaaap.  \\n\\nI explained to him that he’s got to pick up his feet because dragging them on the carpet will build up a “shock”.  My son looks at me and says “Like Pikachu?”\\n\\nA bit of background.  A few months ago I discovered that Disney Now has the full run of all Pokemon episodes.  Like 20+ seasons, each of over 40 episodes.  My son and I have slowly been working our way through them, like 3-4 episodes per week.  My wife and I decided to get a Switch as a family gift for Christmas, along with Let’s Go Pikachu.  For my son’s birthday a few weeks ago, we got him a Pikachu plushie as that would fit in well.  \\n\\nSo a bit after my talk to my son about static electricity, he goes to his room and grabs his Pikachu plushie.  Drags his feet all the way to the office where my wife is playing Frostpunk and says “Donder Shok!!” while zotting her with a nice snappy static shock.  \\n\\nAs he runs away, clutching his plushie, all I can say to my wife was “I think Pikachu’s been teaching him some tricks”.  She was not amused.  \\n\\n\\n\\nTL;DR - Pikachu taught my son Thunder Shock.  My wife is not happy about this development.  \\n\\n\\nEdit:  My first gold!  Thank you kind stranger!\\n\\nEdit 2:  I know this may be more cute than traditionally TIFU, but I’m rather singed at the moment and the wife wasn’t too pleased at the time.   I know she’ll be laughing about it in a day or two with the rest of us (I hope). \\n\\nEdit 3:  My first platinum!  Thank you my friend.   This happened over the weekend and I still think I may hear about this in some way...\\nSo last Friday, some of us teachers were sent a text from our Principal to sign some papers in our email. She likes to make sure everyone responds so she\\'ll message people individually after a while.\\nI have a Saturday job as well so I don\\'t check it until I get home. \\nWell, on my way home I decided to stop by my dealer and bought some OG Cookies. They smelled so good that I texted my Fiancee to tell her what I got.\\nWell, when I get home I asked her if she was ready to try the stuff I got. She was confused as to what I was talking about because she was asking for the name of it and how it smells. I told her that I texted the info before I got home.\\nI checked my phone to see if it sent at all but I discovered that I opened up the wrong text. I had told my Principal/Boss that I had bought some stinky bud and to get our pipe and grinder ready.\\nShe replied back saying \"No thanks but have a good weekend\" and she left a winky face emoji.\\nI\\'ve since talked to her only about work things. Nothing about this weekend had come up but I\\'m still kind of freaking out.\\n\\nEdit: I\\'ve worked with this school district for 5 years. They don\\'t do drug testing. I\\'ve known a few teachers from previous districts that used to partake. I live in CA. The Principal and I have been on good grounds since I\\'ve started. \\n\\nTl:dr- Text my boss instead of my fiancee to tell them I had bought weed. Oooooh boy this is a big FU. I have been working on a cruise ship for the past 5 months. When you live with, work with, eat with, and do everything else with the same people every day for months at a time you tend to get pretty close to them. I was the bass player in a cruise ship band quickly made friends with the drummer, from Brazil. This was my first time working on a cruise ship and this has been a goal of mine since I was just a wee lad. 10 days from the end of my contract me and my drummer friend decided to go out in port and have ourselves a memorable day. Too many beers later it was time to get back to the ship. We, being crew, have a sharp deadline for getting back to the ship. The problem was we, in our drunken stupor, got a little too far from the ship. My friend and I made it back to the port with about 5 minutes to spare but that wasn\\'t enough time to make it through customs and back to the ship. Of the two of us, I had more to drink. Therefore I was the one who had the genius idea to hop the fence and make a dash for the ship. Well the customs officials had a different view on how good an idea that was. The two of us hopped the fence and immediately got busted. The ensuing police debacle not only got us in trouble, but held up the entire cruise ship. The Captain came down onshore and scolded us before firing us on the spot. When you\\'re fired off a cruise ship... You\\'re fired. There and then. They packed our bags for us and threw them on shore as the ship left port. Fortunately I am an American citizen so the consequences for me were to buy my own flight home, but my best friend was handcuffed and escorted to the airport where he was sent home and told never to return. 10 days left... And I fucked it up. \\n\\nTL;DR I convinced my friend to break international immigration law because we were running a few minutes late and now he can never come back So this happened about eight years ago in the sixth grade. Now, if you remember sixth grade, you know that trends fly in and out of style every other week. And just before Sillybands took over as chief Tween Pimp Currency, the big thing at my school was a trend we dubbed \"locker artillery\". Basically, we gathered all the supplies we could from anywhere in the classrooms, and created small projectile weapons from what we scavenged. We would use these weapons to lob erasers, spitballs, and Paper Hornets at ourselves and unsuspecting teachers.\\n\\nEventually, things got out of hand. It became a grade-wide arms race to create the ultimate launching machine. Heists were performed on teacher\\'s desks. Books were destroyed and scrapped for ammunition. Students presented welts from Paper Hornets with the same pride one would display a hickey from a cheerleader. Rubber bands were contraband. It was a full-on Mad Max Magic School Bus adventure.\\n\\nHere\\'s where the fuckup started. One night, I was sitting on my bed, tinkering with various supplies, when it finally hit me: The secret is not the launcher, but the ammo. Spitballs were too light, hornets were too restricting, and erasers were inaccurate. I needed something aerodynamic. So, my sociopath eleven-year-old brain decided that the inkwell of a pen would do nicely. \"I\\'ll cover the tip with an eraser, what could go wrong?\" I thought to myself.\\n\\nLet me tell you.\\n\\nThe next day, I created the ultimate cannon, utilizing no less than seven rubber bands, a pen barrel, two springs, and a binder clip for a trigger. With the inkwell loaded, I felt like a small, sexually frustrated MacGyver with intent to kill. On the bus, my friend (let\\'s call him Neo) was extremely interested in my device, and asked for a demonstration. I obliged, and fit the eraser to the end of the ammo. Neo opened the bus window, and told me to aim outside the window and hit the school wall (we were still parked at the school at this time). I aimed, pulled back and fired. All I saw was the eraser flying off the inkwell before I heard an extremely sudden *crack*. I looked forward, and there was a hole in the double-pane window of the bus, only an inch or two from Neo\\'s head.\\n\\nMy parents had to pay for the window. Neo\\'s parents didn\\'t let me over to his house until Senior Year. The principal cracked down on Locker Artillery and suspended anyone (including myself for three days) who dare use a pen for anything other than writing. \\n\\nBut I still won that arms race.\\n\\nTL;DR: Sixth Grade was obsessed with launching spitballs and erasers at each other. I upgraded the ammo and nearly killed my friend and broke a window with a pen inkwell. I was suspended and my friend\\'s parents don\\'t like me anymore.\\n\\nEDIT: RIP Inbox. Thank you for the gold, kind stranger!\\n\\nUPDATE: Here\\'s the tutorial for the device: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fAoq7xMcMsQ&feature=youtu.be Edited to add: Holy crap, this post blew up more than I expected! Thank you to the anonymous redditors that gave me my first silver and platinum, you are so awesome!\\n\\nNaturally, this did not happen today...\\nTl;dr is at the bottom.\\n\\nAbout a week ago, I was running errands with my 1 and 3 year old boys. We had some time to kill, and my 3 year old said that he wanted to see his daddy. So we picked up lunch and took it to my husband\\'s work so that he could have a hot lunch instead of leftovers from the night before.\\n\\nWe got the boys out of their carseats, let them sit in our laps as we all ate chicken tenders and fries in the front seat. Then, my husband took us for a tour around his shop (he works in sheet metal and makes air ducts). Our kids loved it!\\n\\nAs we were leaving, I saw my husband walking into the building and honked at him, calling out \"hey, nice butt babe!\"\\n\\nThen it happened, my 3 year old yelled \"nice butt daddy!\" Which quickly turned into \"nice butt mama.\"\\n\\nI tried my best to ignore it even though he kept repeating it. I thought that the worst was over when he eventually forgot about it.\\n\\nI was wrong.\\n\\nNow, almost a week later, he is yelling out our living room window;\\n\\n\"Nice butt papa\" (what he calls our elderly neighbor)\\n\\n\"Nice butt mama\"\\n\\n\"Nice butt baby\" (his little brother)\\n\\nI don\\'t think we will be leaving the house today...\\n\\nTL;DR I set a bad example for my child and now he is telling everyone that they have a nice butt. Hi everyone!\\n\\nI got a lot of requests to do an update so here it is! But first I just wanna say thank you to everyone who helped me see an embarrassing situation as something that would be a great story one day. I’m happy that the most horrifying moment of my life could make some of you guys smile. I also want to say thank you to those who said I ripped off that one Friends episode. I might be one of the few people on the planet who hasn’t watched Friends but I checked it out, and definitely laughed :) I was a little bummed out reading some of the comments about my boyfriend. I promise you all he’s a really great guy and he was just in so much shock that he didn’t react the best. I don’t really blame him though. Anyways… On to the update!\\n\\nThe night my in-laws walked in on me, they were supposed to stay for dinner and then go back to the hotel they were staying at. After I was ahem… caught in the act, my boyfriend and them left and went back to their hotel. He said it was a very quiet car ride. When he got back a few hours later, we got into a fight where he questioned my motives and accused me of purposely getting caught to prove a point. I denied it and the argument ended there. He slept on the couch that night. The next morning I woke up and he had made breakfast for us. He apologized to me and basically explained that he was so embarrassed and in shock that he didn’t know what to think. He said that he did appreciate the effort though, and that had his parents not been there with him, he “would’ve jumped” me. I apologized for surprising him at an inappropriate time and for not checking my phone. I then asked him what his parents thought about all of it. He told me that they weren’t angry at all and that they decided not to come for dinner because they didn’t want me to be uncomfortable and they thought it’d be best to give us the night to sort things out. He told me that they did intend to come for dinner tonight which I told him I didn’t think I was up for quite yet. He understood and called his mother to let her know. I didn’t hear much of the conversation but it ended up with him handing me the phone saying “She wants to talk to you.” As soon as I got the phone I started profusely apologizing and telling her that it wasn’t my intention for them to see that. She just laughed and said “I imagine it wasn’t” and said that embarrassing things happen, especially in front of family and that they would never hold something like that against me. But that I would never live it down. She then proceeded to tell me of the many times my boyfriend and his brother had walked in on them doing the dirty. Which was uncomfortable but kinda comforting. She then said that she and her husband were really looking forward to dinner and wondered if I’d reconsider. I realized that I was going to have to see them at some point and that it would be shitty of me to not have them over after they drove all this way to see us. So I agreed. They came over, it was awkward. But after a few jokes about if the couch was steamed cleaned and if the adult movie I was watching was included in our cable package, everything went really well!\\n\\nTL:DR Boyfriend apologized, parents don’t hate me.\\n\\nOriginal post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/i59mtc/tifu\\\\_by\\\\_trying\\\\_to\\\\_surprise\\\\_my\\\\_boyfriend\\\\_and/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/i59mtc/tifu_by_trying_to_surprise_my_boyfriend_and/) So this just happened. Back story i had a GF of 6 years i was going to propose to, and as not necessarily superstitious i will not \"recycle\" an engagment ring even tho it cost what it did. I thought it was stolen or lost. It had been missing for close to 3 years. \\n\\nSo what happened. In the proccess of rearranging my kitchen i decided to consolidate a few boxes of the same product (lipton tea) i had several boxes and was going to put them all into one. Simple enough i thought. \\n\\nNow with my new girl friend standing to my right i open the first box and holly mother of fucking pearl it cant be, but it is the ring box. This is where my thinking was holly shit i just found that ring, no way... hey babe check this out just found that ring i lost. Not really thinking a lot about it i open the box and turn to her. \\n\\nSeemed pretty simple i found a lost ring, hey look what i found.\\n\\nAnd thats when she made a really awkward face started shaking and runs out of the room basicly saying no fucking way Oh My God no fucking way. At this point im like wtf was that about. When i walk around the corner to check whats wrong shes almost crying saying really too soon, not yet at least.\\n\\nLIGHT BULB she thought i was proposing to her ( in what may be one of the strangest ways possible) but never the less she saw a ring being held out to her and freaked the fuck out. \\n\\nHour latter trying to explain i wasent and it was a lost ring i had literally just found she and i are laughing our asses off.\\n\\nGood to know it wasent a flat out no!\\n\\n\\nTL;DR found a lost ring had bad timing GF thought i was propossing heart fell to floor hilarity insued.\\n\\nUpdate: texting with no thumb trying to keep up. Also i have learned how to spell wasn\\'t!\\n\\nNsfw thumb\\n\\nUpdate 2: went for a walk with her after this happened and cut the side of my thumb off using  knife that happens to be very sharp!  Was trying to post a link not have reddit auto show image so removed, my bad. Honestly, the story behind this isn\\'t to exciting, but the accidental punch line had everybody (including my deaf girlfriend) laughing pretty damn hard.\\nEdit: title typo. It\\'s Bop It. Two words.\\n\\nOne thing I LOVE to do after a long day of work is sitting my butt down infront of my monitor, ripping a joint, and playing Xbox with some friends.\\n\\nLong story short that\\'s exactly what I did. I got super high, was playing games with my friends when Bop It got brought up in conversation. So, my high ass turns to my girlfriend on the couch next to me and signed (without speaking) \"Did you ever play Bop It growing up?\" My girlfriend so innocently just signs back \"wtf is that?\"\\nEdit: for those that don\\'t know, Bop It is a speed and coordination toy from the mid 90s that requires hearing to play.\\n\\nGuys, it took me a good 20-30 seconds before I realized what I just asked my 100% DEAF girlfriend of 2 YEARS. The shame I felt. \\n\\nAnyway, I told the boys online, everyone had a solid laugh including my hellova good sport girlfriend. \\n\\nTL;DR I got high while playing video games w/friends when Bop-it was brought up in convo. Asked my born deaf gf of 2 years if she\\'d ever played it. Surprisingly enough no she had not, and I felt incredibly stupid. Obligatory this fuckup happened a few months back, but to be fair I did not realize the extent of the issue until today.\\n\\nSo back in June, as I\\'m sure you all remember, it had been a few months since any store in my area had been able to stock toilet paper of any kind. This was the kind of thing that was a big deal to most people, but not me. I had a plan. A secret trick up my sleeve that gave me an advantage over everybody else: Amazon. That\\'s right, while these suckers were wrestling over individual rolls like Black Friday shoppers, I would be sipping cocoa on my couch and getting it all delivered right to my door.\\n\\nNow, I had actually stocked up on TP toward the beginning of the lockdown. However, I did not have any flushable wipes, and I was able to find a box of eight individual packs of Cottonelle Flushable Wipes for a pretty good price. I popped them in my cart, clicked \"buy now,\" and I never had to leave the couch. Win-win, right?\\n\\nA few weeks, maybe a month, after the wipes arrived and I began using them, I started noticing… a tingle. But not a pleasant tingle, more of an itch. A very very distracting itch. Like, an insanely overwhelmingly frustrating itch that will absolutely not go away unless I sit on the business end of a belt sander. Not something that is easy to deal with when you\\'re standing in line at the bank. I had to fight my hand from instinctively twitching toward my agonizing butthole with every itchy pang, it must have looked like the drugs I had keistered were slipping out.\\n\\nAs luck would have it, right around the time I began experience symptoms, I was laid off due to COVID. My healthcare was employer-provided, and while I now know that they are continuing my coverage for a few more months, the whole layoff was pretty sudden and at the time I had no idea where my healthcare coverage stood. Furthermore, I didn\\'t feel like an itchy asshole was a great reason to go to the hospital during an ongoing pandemic when 1. I don\\'t want to catch COVID; second, I assumed I had just developed some kind of sensitivity to the chemicals in the wipes that would go away on its own; and C. I feel like every doctor in the country has more important things to do right now than look at my asshole. So, rather than seek the advice of a medical professional, I decided to just not do anything about it and hope it would go away. Smart right?\\n\\nFast forward to today. Four months after I purchased the wipes. Butthole as itchy as ever. Seriously considering seeking medical help at this point. I wake up in the middle of the night in great discomfort, and check my phone to see the time. 4 AM. I also have an email from Amazon about a recent order I placed. I open the email, and it reads as follows:\\n\\n>Greetings from Amazon.  \\n>  \\n>We have recently learned of a potential safety issue regarding the following product that our records indicate you purchased from Amazon:  \\n>  \\n>Cottonelle FreshFeel Flushable Wet Wipes for Adults, 8 Flip-Top Packs, 42 Wipes per Pack (336 Wipes Total)  \\n>  \\n>**Cottonelle has informed us that the product might contain bacterium, Pluralibacter gergoviae, which was detected during product testing.** More details, including how to determine if your purchase is impacted and what you should do next can be found in the following notification:  \\n>  \\n>[https://www.cottonelle.com/en-us/recallfaq](https://www.cottonelle.com/en-us/recallfaq)\\n\\nThis was an option I had legitimately never considered until I got this message. The very thing I had purchased to clean bacteria off of my ass had **contaminated my ass with bacteria.** I feel so betrayed. Also, super gross. Super, super gross. Time to go to the doctor.\\n\\nTL;DR – Bought flushable wipes so my butt would be clean. Wipes made butt angry. Months later, I find out that the wipes were contaminated with bacteria, and I might as well have been wiping my ass with leaves from the yard, and now I need medical attention. Cool.\\n\\nEDIT: please for christ\\'s sake don\\'t spend money on reddit awards for my butthole, if you want to make me feel better [donate to Jaime Harrison](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/ms_harrison_fr_homepage_2019?refcode=MS_HP_FR_X_X_homepage_X__F1_S1_C1__X&recurring=auto&amount=25) and kick Lindsey Graham the fuck out of the Senate\\n\\nAlso for those concerned, I do now have a bidet attachment, got one a month or so ago. At the time I bought the wipes, due to the societal TP freakout, bidets were out of stock too. Rest assured that no more wipes will be purchased.\\n\\nDOUBLE EDIT, just to make it super clear for the (relatively small) number of you that still seem to be confused:\\n\\n* Donald Trump is a fat bald lazy racist bitch.\\n* He\\'s a stupid loser with no money and no friends.\\n* He\\'s a gross old welfare queen living off daddy\\'s money and the taxpayer.\\n* He\\'s too dumb to even be a fascist correctly.\\n* If you voted for Trump, or you are planning to vote for Trump, fuck you. So I\\'m a pretty average person all around, with the exception that I\\'m tall (6\\'4\").  I consider myself of average intelligence, average looks, average sense of humor, average dick size.\\n\\nReally the only other dicks I\\'ve seen are a) in porn, and b) a couple of buddies on a skinny dipping night.  In all cases I\\'m smaller.  I already know some comments are gonna be all \"But what about in the locker room?\" what locker rooms are you in that everyone is running around balls out naked?  My gym has individual showers and change areas, there\\'s very occasionally someone getting changed in the common area, but I\\'m not staring at their junk, and yeah, every so often I see someone smaller than me, but that reinforced my viewpoint that I\\'m extremely average.  Okay, back to the story.\\n\\nRecently I got divorced, I had been with my ex wife for 16 years.  She was my first, and the only woman I\\'d ever been with.  Whenever we used condoms I\\'d always dread it.  I mean, all guys say the same thing about them right?  There\\'s no feeling, difficult staying hard, everyone hates condoms.  I just assumed that was the universal truth, and it never occurred to me to investigate further.  Every time I had to put one on I\\'d start to go flaccid, apologize, and work really hard to perform.  Sex was bad, often way more work than it was worth.\\n\\nWell, recently I met a woman on Tinder.  She has more experience than I do.  Before meeting she asked about my size and I answered honestly, I\\'m super average.  She said that\\'s cool, and we went on a date.  At the end of it we hooked up, and there I am trying to put on a condom, same thing as usual happening, struggling to roll it down, starting to go flaccid, getting embarrassed, when she points out that apparently I\\'m incorrect, not average, and am wearing the wrong sized condoms.  I wrote it off, I thought she was just being polite and trying to give me an ego boost to help be not feel so bad.  At our next encounter she handed me a larger condom.  Holy fucking shit.  What the fuck.  I no longer feel like I\\'m about to be swung into battle by an enraged Gimli.\\n\\nYes, I recognize the humble brag, but what a fucking waste of 16 years.  I\\'m more pissed about that, then I am \\'happy\\' about my dick size.  I\\'m elated about this problem being fixed, and want to jump for joy and tell my friends, but who can I possibly tell without sounding like a giant bragging douche?  Nobody, so instead I\\'m telling you, I\\'m fine with sounding like a douche to you.\\n\\nTL;DR - Wasted 16 years having terrible sex cause I was wearing condoms that were too small.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nedit - A lot of people are reading this as though I\\'d never had sex without a condom, which isn\\'t the case.  My ex wife was on and off birth control for a myriad of reasons.  When she was on all was good, when she was off I was in a frequent battle with the Scranton Strangler. So this happened last night, and I\\'m still recovering from it...\\n\\nA bit of backstory, my wife and I have been working the entire time during quarantine so we were able to keep some semblance of normality in our lives. She works for a website development company writing code and such. I\\'m an essential worker, with bright and early days and a 21:00ish bedtime.\\n\\nCue about 3 months ago, her boss issues \"Crunch\" for all devs. She has been working 10 to 14 hour days Monday - Friday. Naturally, she has been hard at work and our personal lives took a bit of a step back. We would still do things together during the weekends, but not as often.\\n\\nOn to last night, we were watching a bit of some bullshit show on Netflix. It was really boring so we went right to the \"chill\" part of things. And this is were things took a wrong turn.\\n\\nHorny brained me decided it would be a fantastic idea to tickle my dangerously ticklish wife (horny brained me is an idiot), so I tickled. She yelped and (deservedly and unintentionally) headbutted me right across the face. As I\\'m laughing and holding my face, I notice she went pale. I look at my hands, blood. So I head to the washroom.\\n\\nAs I\\'m cleaning my face I notice my lip is slightly lower than it should be so I turn it inside out to find a gaping hole near my two front teeth. So off to the emergency room we go.\\n\\nShamefully explain to the attending what happened. She laughs. I get 2 stitches inside my mouth and am told to not eat anything hot or solid for the next 24 hours.\\n\\nWhen we get home she looks at me and says: \"You still horny?\". Me: \"Yup\". Good times...\\n\\nTL;DR: Horny brained me tickled my wife. Ended up with stitches in my mouth.\\n\\nEdit: Spelling.\\n\\nEdit 2: Thanks for all the awards and upvotes! Y\\'all are amazing!\\n\\nEdit 3: Some people asked what was the show. I\\'m not sure on the English name since the show is in Turkish. Translating it directly from my native language it would mean \"The Guardian\". Hope that helps!\\n\\nEdit 4: Thanks again everyone! Did not expect this post to blowup the way it did!  My wifey and I share a Google log in for ease as I work shifts and we have to coordinate Christmas gifts for the kids and our busy lives.\\n\\n\\nToday I had a day off to get on with some house stuff whilst wifey is at work and the kids are at school. I zoomed through the chores so I could spend a couple of quality hours on my hobby.\\n\\n\\nMy hobby is model painting and for my recent 40th my amazing wifey got me an air brush and a compressor to run it. I tootled around with it for a while before realising that the air brush and compressor were different makes so I needed an adaptor to make them work together. I found one online and duly purchased it.\\n\\n\\nJust a short while later I received an angry call from my wifey wanting to know why I was looking at niche porn\\xa0 when tonight is date night. She was quite upset and asked why when she went on Google during her lunch, the most recent searches were for \"1/2 inch female nipples\", \"nipple enhancers\" and \"hose extensions\".\\n\\n\\n\"You see honey, the screw on part that sticks out the compressor is called a nipple and it\\'s only 1/4\" when I have a 1/2\" airhose to attach to it so I need a half inch female nipple adapter to connect the two... Yes that is a silly name... no, your nipples are perfect...yes I\\'m sure, I love you too.\"\\n\\nUPDATES: just to answer the regular questions. \\n\\nI was painting models from the fellowship of the ring and finishing their bases off. \\n\\nNo, my wifey has no issue with me looking at porn. She just was concerned I was looking at something to do with nipple resizing and that I only liked a specific type of nipple. She got self conscious and worried so phoned me in an angry and upset panic. \\n\\nYes my wifey is self conscious about herself. Show me a part of a lady we guys don\\'t sexualise and you\\'ll finally have found the part of a woman\\'s body that they don\\'t have hang ups about. \\n\\nNo she wasn\\'t snooping through my search history, Google just brings up our last 5 or so things we searched. \\n\\nYes I know there are other ways to share calendars and the like. I\\'m 40 so not interested in learning new apps or functions, this works for me and that is fine. \\n\\nFor those who felt calling my wife by her nickname was cringy, that\\'s something I really hadn\\'t considered before. Now that you\\'ve made me see it in that light I can realise I should have wifey wifey wifey wifey wifey wifey wifey wifey wifey. \\n\\nDate night is my idea. Since I work shifts I make sure and put aside time just for the two of us, it\\'s one day every 3 weeks. \\n\\nDate night was great, thanks for the well wishes. We played a couch coop game on the console for 8 hours, chuckled together at the comments and got a ruler out as one of the comments suggested. Twas a fun and precisely measured evening for all. \\n\\nTL;DR the correct technical term for the metal coupling adaptor I needed for a compresser was a 1/2 inch female nipple, leading to Google search confusion. This happened earlier today. So I was in class listening to a lecture and it dawned on me that I couldn\\'t care less about what my professor was talking about. So I decided to start holding my breath. Now, this is something I normally do if I get really bored. I\\'ll hold my breath for as long as I can and then I\\'ll rest for 3 minutes. I\\'ll do 5 sets of that. I also make sure to pinch my nose as to avoid cheating. I\\'ve actually gotten pretty good at it and can hold my breath for 2 minutes and 15 seconds now. Anyways, I start holding my breath and I\\'m feeling particularly good and I start thinking I can break my record today. I got to about 2 minutes and 20 seconds on my first attempt and then I decide to drop out. \"I can do better, let\\'s go for 2 minutes and 50 seconds\". So I go and I\\'m feeling super confident about it. I get to 2 minutes 20 sec and I\\'m feeling a little light headed. Get to 2 min and 30 seconds and I\\'m struggling. Like I\\'m thrashing around silently in my chair, but I\\'m going for gold. Get to 2 minutes 40 and I\\'m seriously hurting. Things are getting bad. I close my eyes to avoid looking at my watch (It also made the seconds go faster) All of a sudden I open my eyes and I\\'m looking up at the ceiling and everyone is flipping out. As I learned from the girl sitting next to me, it turns out my maximum effort resulted into me passing out, smashing my head on my desk, and falling out of my chair. I spent the next 10 minutes trying to explain to everyone that I was fine. Lecture finally resumed and I just sat there feeling like a dumbass with a gnarly headache. Lecture still sucked after that. \\n\\nTL;DR Tried going for Olympic gold in breath holding. Failed and ended up spread eagle in our lecture hall. \\n\\nEDIT: A word \\n\\n Posting here by suggesting from AITA.\\n\\nLast week my (24F) boyfriend (28M) and I got into an argument about which one of us puts in the most effort to keep things adventurous sexually. He argued that 90% of the time, it’s him. I told him that I didn’t think that was true and he responded that not once in the 3 years we’ve been together, have I ever caught him off guard sexually. I told him that he was gonna eat his words and the next time I proposed sex, it would be a surprise. \\n\\nNow, I knew that he was going to be expecting something after that so I decided today would be the best day to do it. The reason being was that his parents were coming to visit from out of town and when they do, I’m way too stressed out to even think of sex so I knew he wouldn’t be expecting anything. He told me that he would be home from work at 4 and they would be arriving at 7ish. Perfect, that would give us some time to do the deed, clean up, and then have ourselves a little secret for when the in-laws visit. So I set myself up on the living room couch (which was a clear view from the door) wearing only a pair of heels. I decided to put some porn on the TV (which I never typically watch) and touch myself to it so when he came in he would surely be surprised. I had my head tipped back when the door opened and all I heard were gasps. I looked up and stood there was my boyfriend and his parents. I flipped over and scrambled for a blanket to cover myself and heard the door slam. I checked my phone and saw that my boyfriend had texted me that his parents had left earlier to avoid traffic. He came home a few hours later and was extremely angry and is convinced I did this to get back at him for saying I don’t try hard enough. Dinner with the in-laws is going to be a bit awkward. \\n\\nTL;DR Boyfriend said I don\\'t surprise him enough. Decided to surprise him naked, watching porn, and playing with myself in the living room. He walked in and was surprised... and so were his parents who arrived with him. Trowaway account for privacy, this happened yesterday and I don\\'t know how to make it up.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I met at university 4 years ago, and we both graduated some time ago. Since then we\\'ve both been looking for work, but the research is more difficult than we thought, and until yesterday neither of us had managed to get a job. Yesterday my girlfriend received a positive answer to one of her applications, for a job located 430 kilometers from our hometown. She was very happy and that\\'s how she told me to come to her house to tell me some good news about the research. So expecting some good news, I took a detour to buy her sushi because we both love it, and I arrived at her house early in the evening, and that\\'s when she tells me that in two weeks she\\'s going to go more than 400 kilometers from our city, and that I now have to look in the same area as her. I totally lost my mind when she told me that. I explain that I understand that the research is complicated, but that it was no reason to look at work across the country, and that I had no desire to leave my family and friends because my life is in my hometown. The situation then became very tense, she told me that I am selfish and that I have to learn to move away, that even if there is no urgency, it is important to find a job quickly so as not to remain inactive. I then offered her a long-distance relationship for a few months because I really don\\'t want to leave, and she could come back as soon as she found a job in our city. And that, guys, she took it really hard, I\\'ve never seen her so upset in my life. She then gave me an ultimatum: either I follow her or we stop our relationship, and she asks me if I\\'m really ready to leave her to stay with my family and friends. Maybe some people can see it, but this is the moment I fucked up.\\n\\nI still don\\'t know why my brain betrayed me like that, but the only answer I could find was : \"Perhaps, maybe it is a small price to pay for salvation\". I could have made long rants to show her that I love her, that I care about her. I could have found arguments so that we could solve the situation, as any person in a relationship for 4 years would do. But no, my fucking stupidity made me quote a purple guy. She looked at me with an empty look for several seconds, I realized how much I fucked up, but nothing came from my mouth. She just asks me to leave her house, and since yesterday she speak to me or answer my calls and messages. I sent her a very long message of apology, adding that I hope we will be able to resolve the situation, but still no answer.\\n\\nI am now staring my Thanos funko pop thinking how much this guy may have ruined part of my life.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT : Whoah, this blew up far more than I could imagine. I took time to read all your comments, and I spend a big part of my day speaking with my GF about the situation. So here\\'s the situation : 1) She\\'s mad that in such a situation my only answer was quoting a meme, 2) She thinks (and she\\'s not the only one from what I read) that I\\'m still a child for wanting to stay in my city.\\n\\nTo clarify some things I\\'m living in a small country in Europe, that\\'s why 400km is basically across the country. Then I admit it, I may not be ready to start my professional life. In my head I\\'m still a student who always wants to enjoy his life like it was : going out with friends, enjoying parties in the middle of the week, watching sports and taking care of my GF. For me, the best to start my work life was to find a job in my city to keep my bearings and my way of life and to be able to gradually switch to something more serious. That\\'s a big part of why a freaked out when she told me to come far away from everything that defines my life. Also yes, there was a big lack of communication in my relationship, she\\'s the first to admit it and apologizes for it.\\n\\nToday we had a more serious discussion (no meme quotes guys !) where both of us expressed their point of view. For my GF, this work is not her dream work, but she wants to take it because we can\\'t find nothing here and she just wants to take it in order to gain experience, and then quit it to a better opportunity. She told me that it would only be a matters of months. I explained my feelings and what I wanted to start my life, and to my surprise she understood. We even reached an agreement : I will looking for a job in my city and in the city where she will work, and i will take the first opportunity. She also needs me to be with here the first month to help her settle in and not to stress about her new situation.  Now that we\\'ve explained and reached a compromise, she\\'s much calmer and ready to go on, so it seems my stupidity and the purple guy may have not ruined something.\\n\\nOh, I saw some people were wondering : when I left her house yesterday, I didn\\'t take back the sushi\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR : GF finds a job far away from our city and I doesn\\'t want to leave my life to live this far. She asks me if I\\'m really ready to leave her just to stay in my city and my only answer was \"Maybe it is a small price to pay for salvation\". Everyone thinks their dog is the best. But seriously mine is pretty cool. Now that I work from home we spend basically every minute of every day together and we vibe perfectly...\\n\\nHe sleeps in while I shower and get ready, then a morning walk, then he naps while I work, lunch together, we use a leash but it’s superfluous, so on and so on.\\n\\nThe most “protest” I get from him is when I want to snuggle, he doesn’t, and he’ll crawl closer inch by inch until I leave him alone.\\n\\nWe also have a fenced in backyard and a dog door, so he has free reign of the house and backyard. Most days.\\n\\nToday we have a repair guy working in the backyard, so Camden has to stay inside. He hasn’t complained at all and asked only once to go out to pee. And this is where I fucked up.\\n\\nHe watched the repair guy for a second, he peed, and then he watched the repair guy again. I assumed that meant he was done, so I called him inside. And the little bastard hestitated. I assumed he just wanted to be outside longer so I called him again and he trotted back in like the best damn dog he is. \\n\\nThen he shit in the middle of the floor.\\n\\nTL;DR: My dog loves me so much he shit on the floor instead of disobeying me.\\n\\n[Tax](https://i.imgur.com/AESsQS2) This happened in the Oughties. TL/DR below.\\n\\nMy (relatively small) HS held an unexpected Live Active Shooter drill.  It was the first time they had ever done this. I don\\'t know who developed this genius procedure. It actually makes no sense because of how they initiated it.\\n\\nWe had once previously practiced what to do in this event maybe a week prior, kind of casually. The teachers were aware of the timing of this drill but didn\\'t tell us because... The trauma would help us react better? No idea. In fact, I remember our teacher (and likely all others) calling in at one point probably to check in that everybody was accounted for.\\n\\nHowever, it so happened that I was kicked out of class just prior to the announcement. My teacher was pretty flustered after minutes of me being a clown, and just yelled at me to get out - but he was super frantic about me getting to the office immediately. Now I understand why. (His mistake, but I played my part soon after)\\n\\nOn my way to the office (I was taking my time of course) the lights went out as though a main breaker were flipped, just the way they all went out immediately. Emergency exit lights came on, and the principal came over the intercom telling all teachers some code phrase which basically initiated the lock-up/lights-out/cower-in-the-corner procedure. I was truly in a WTF state.\\n\\nHere\\'s where I F-up. Now I am the only dummy walking the hallways. Given the layout of this building, when I tell you it was dark, I mean \"you could hardly see your own hand\" dark - even with the small distant exit emergency light down the hall. And it was completely silent now. It all happened in a matter of seconds. I can\\'t say I was scared necessarily because we all knew that there\\'d likely be a live drill at some point. Still, given my aversion to our principal since I was in trouble a lot, and not knowing what to do, I just ran following the wall with my hand back to my class and started banging on the door. I assumed my teacher knew what was happening and I didn\\'t want to be in more trouble so I just yelled\\n\\n**\"HEY LET ME IN!!\"**\\n\\nThe entire class of 20 kids in the dark instantly screamed at the top of their lungs, which then caused the adjacent classroom who was also in complete darkness (no windows on this side of the building), to also start screaming and panicking. This coalescence of fear became so loud that nobody knew what the hell was happening and the teachers were of course required to keep the doors shut no matter what, nor were they supposed to communicate with anyone outside their door till given an all clear as far as I recall.  (Again, this was not a well thought-out plan).\\n\\nNow of course, my teacher must have called the office - but the message wasn\\'t relayed properly and I\\'ll never know what he told them - because somebody came around the corner and in the loudest voice I had heard in my life said\\n\\n**\"GET ON THE GROUND!!!\"**\\n\\nThere was a police officer visiting the school to oversee the drill! So whether he was taking the opportunity to do his part in acting or really thought I somehow picked the worse possible day to commit mass murder, I don\\'t know. He did not have his gun drawn, just his flashlight. He grabbed me up and took me to the office.\\n\\nThe rest was a huge blur but essentially I was not punished for THAT, but I got extra shit for my classroom behavior given the context. There was an assembly held the same day where we were all apologized to for not running this drill knowingly first. Parents were pissed, it was a whole thing.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL/DR: Became unaccounted for just as an Active School Shooter Drill was initiated, ran around and scared the life out of roughly 50 people.\\n\\nEdit: spelling Like all good TIFUs, this didn’t happen yesterday.\\n\\nMy wife and I went to one of our favorite restaurants in town a couple weeks ago.  It’s just a bar and grill on the lake shore where you can sit outside right next to the water.  Whenever the weather is nice, we love sitting out there and enjoying a couple beers with dinner.\\n\\nOne of our favorite parts about sitting out there is the wildlife.  From our spot, you can look into the water and see fish swimming around and ducks love hanging out there.  I assume people toss fries or whatever for the ducks, so they made this area an official hangout.\\n\\nOn this particular evening, my wife and I were the only ones eating outside and we saw a pair of ducks (a drake and a hen) swimming offshore.  I thought it would be fun to pull up YouTube and make duck noises.  I found a video that had a couple different duck calls, so I started playing it.  Lo and behold, the ducks responded.  At first they started by making the call back to me, but gradually, they moved closer and closer.  They ended up on-shore and only a few feet away.  It was a pretty fun experience.  That is, until it got out of hand.\\n\\nApparently my phone was loud enough for other ducks to hear, because another drake swooped in.  This other drake had no interest in me, however.  He immediately went for the hen.  This led to a fight between the two drakes.  They started yelling (quacking) at each other and eventually flew off and chased each other around the lake with the hen following them.  Unfortunately, the original drake did not win the mating fight and the new drake flew off with the hen.\\n\\nMy wife and I stared at each other in disbelief as this whole thing played out.  She still jokingly calls me a home-wrecker, and I suppose that’s fair.\\n\\nI’m not really super torn up about it.  In fact, I find the whole situation kind of amusing.  I thought this more light-hearted TIFU belonged here.\\n\\nTL;DR:  Went to dinner and played duck calls.  Called in another drake and ruined a family.\\n\\nEdit:  Dang, my first gold!  I feel weird taking this blood money, but thanks anyway! So today I went to the bank after work to draw some cash from the ATM. Quick transaction, in and out.\\n\\nIt was real cold outside, so I left the engine running and locked the doors. Don\\'t worry, I have an extra set of keys in my work coat pocket so I can go inside with peace of mind, not needing to look at my car every 2 seconds.\\n\\nNow, here\\'s where the \"fun\" begins... As I\\'m walking back to my car, a random lady in her 50s tells me\\n\\n-Well, If I were you I\\'d be scared to get my car stolen!\\n\\nTo which I reply, with a huge smile (Cause I tought I was beeing funny)\\n\\n-Yea, don\\'t worry it\\'s not my car.\\n\\n*I open the door and drive away, still laughing like a madman*\\n\\nNow... On my way back home I get pulled over by a cop. I wasn\\'t confused, I tought he caught me speeding cause I was going 65 ish in a 50 zone (Km/h). He was chill, asked for my papers and once he had a good look at me went\\n\\n-Sir, your car was reported as stolen by a concerned citizen 10 minutes ago, any idea what happened?\\n\\nSo yea, I bursted out laughing and told him the whole story and he didn\\'t give me a ticket.\\n\\n(the whole thing happened in French, so please be nice on my grammar)\\n\\n-TL;DR Made a joke about me stealing my own car, got pulled over for it.\\n\\nEdit: some grammar Today I received a message with a temperature in imperial units, so, since I had no idea on how many degrees C they were, I just search online for the conversion.\\n\\nSo, I just searched \"98.6 f to c\". On Bing, because that\\'s my default search engine.\\n\\nThen I was called by a customer at the front desk, and I immediately left my computer for 30 minutes, leaving the search result on the screen.\\n\\nWhen I come back, I see a crowd murmoring nearby my computer. My manager asks me \"you search this stuff during work hours??\".\\n\\nI say \"yes, because i had no idea how to convert them\". He watches me puzzled, goes away.\\n\\nThen I watch the screen. I see PORN on it????!!!\\n\\nFUCKING BING SHOWS **PORN** WHEN SEARCHING FOR UNIT CONVERSION????????\\n\\nI try to explain it, but nobody at works speaks english, they thought I searched some porn keywords.\\n\\nFor who doesn\\'t believe it: [https://imgur.com/a/b6aKkYO](https://imgur.com/a/b6aKkYO) (obviously NSFW - direct link [https://i.imgur.com/LSMMNnv.png](https://i.imgur.com/LSMMNnv.png))\\n\\nTL;DR. Searched \"98.6 f to c\" on Bing. For some weird reason, first results are porn videos. Nobody speaks english, everyone at work thought I searched for porn. This actually happened yesterday but I couldn\\'t get a chance to post it.  \\n\\nI\\'m a pretty \"basic\" white girl. I\\'m 21, I like Starbucks, I wear leather leggings and hoodies, I\\'m blonde, I have a part time job as a secretary-- so it was not surprising that the guy I\\'m sorta dating didn\\'t believe me when I told him I\\'ve been kickboxing for the better part of a decade. Instead of going to the gym and jogging, kickboxing has been a way for me to be active and stay fit. It kinda pissed me off he thought I\\'m making it up to look cool in front of him because he\\'s been trying to get into kickboxing-- so I figured, why not have like a fun date at the gym he\\'s been going and kick the heavy bags and have fun.  \\n\\nHe kinda laughed at the idea but I made him accept.  \\n\\nWe got to the gym, I met his gym friends, his coach and so far it was going good. The dumbass jokingly said we should spar and that he\\'d go easy on me-- told me with sparring gear it wouldn\\'t hurt and it\\'d be fun. There was no way I\\'m saying no to that. My plan was show him that experience matters and make him believe me that I\\'ve really been doing this for a looooooong time-- but no, the asshole didn\\'t put on any protective gear. I got mad.  \\n\\nWe begin. He\\'s laughing, his friends are laughing and cheering for me like I\\'m some kid-- and I\\'m just getting more and more pissed off by the minute. The cheering was the boiling point. As soon as my date got close enough, out of nowhere I decided to head kick him with everything I had. I literally grunted as I kicked him. In the ten or so years I\\'ve been kickboxing I don\\'t think I\\'ve EVER kicked anyone that hard. He was out cold before he even hit the ground. \\n\\nNeedless to say, when he came to his senses he had no choice but to accept that I\\'ve actually been kickboxing for quite some time-- I also invited him over at my place tonight and plan to make him dinner to apologize for the KO.  \\n\\nSurprisingly, he doesn\\'t hate me and laughed it off-- and accepted the dinner invite which is a win in my book. \\n\\ntl;dr: My date didn\\'t believe me I\\'ve been kickboxing for quite a long time and asked me to spar. I head kicked him and knocked him out cold.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit; This kinda blew up and I can\\'t reply to everyone! I know what I did is fucked up and bad and I realize how bad it\\'d look if the genders were reversed. I didn\\'t post this to gloat and brag nor do I think he had it coming-- I thought this sub is about fuck ups- this was a fuck up on my part. I didn\\'t realize this would offend so many people.\\n\\nEdit 2; Guys, I can\\'t stress this enough- I posted this because I fucked up. He\\'s fine and his coach took him to the hospital. I\\'m really sorry if this came out as me bragging, it\\'s on me for writing it up like this. I hope someone reads the edits because I can\\'t reply to every individual comment. So let me give some context on how this happened, a while ago i tried out an e-cig my friend has and he made fun of how smoke only goes out of one of my nostrils,i didn’t think much of it , i thought its just a stuffed nose.\\n\\nSo i try to clean my nose and its already not stuffed but yet again i didn’t put much thought into it.\\nYesterday i noticed that my right nostril is blocked again and my nose isn’t stuffed, so i go look in the mirror to see that my right nostril is completely blocked by my septum.\\n\\nI took a doctor appointment the next morning and as soon as he looked in he said i have septum deviation caused by breaking my nose at some point in my life when i was a kid and that it needed surgery.\\nI cant believe i’ve went for god knows how many years without realizing i wasn’t breathing correctly and thinking that this was the norm.\\nSurgery is within 24hours so yeah, this escalated quickly.\\n\\nTL;DR. i’m stupid and didn’t realize my right nostril was blocked off by my septum for years. This did happen today. My grandmother is really superstitious about stuff. She doesn\\'t eat certain kinds of food on certain days of the week and other such things. One of her main superstitions revolves around the layout of the house. She says that no one should sleep with their heads pointing north. So she keeps changing the position of my bed when I am away for work. When I come back, I reposition it my way so that I don\\'t get sunlight on my face early morning. \\nToday, she was repositioning the room while I was there which annoyed me. So I took out my phone and opened the compass app to show her that I was not sleeping with my head pointing north at all. Infact I was pointing east . I instantly realised that she has been sleeping with her bed pointing north. And she has been sleeping on that bed for around 30 years. I pointed it out to her. I thought she would take it lightly. Oh man I was wrong. I fucked up biig time. She lost herself. She started pulling out the blueprint of the house and her old compass. I am looking at her old compass right now and I can say it doesn\\'t seem right at all. I think I will have to fix this issue today itself. She is 90 and quiet hard to talk to cause her hearing isn\\'t great. How stupid am I. \\n\\nTL;DR : I fucked up by showing my grandmother that she was sleeping with her bed pointing north which she is strictly against cause of her superstitious beliefs. She did not take it well . \\n\\nEdit 1: a lot of you are asking me how she moves furniture at the age of 90. Well she doesnt do it herself, she has a helper who is supposed to take care of her personally but my grandmother doesn\\'t like the idea of employing someone particularly for her so she gives her household chores to keep her busy.\\nEdit 2: yes the caregiver gets paid extra for this. We tell her not to do the chores  and I assure you it\\'s not that regular.  In 5th grade, I had a black history month project where I had to make a presentation on a person of my choice. I looked up ‘important African Americans’ and found a Wikipedia page with a list of famous black people, or so I thought. I chose Allan McLeod Cormack, a South-African American scientist, seeing that he invented the CT scan. I put my blood sweat and tears into that project. Two days before the project was due I decided to put a picture of Cormack on my poster. To my confusion, all I could find was a picture of this white guy. Turns out, he was a white South African. I made the mistake of telling my teacher instead of keeping it a secret, thinking that it would be better to come clean. She let me go through with the presentation portion of the project, but I had to completely start over on my research and redo the write-up on someone actually worthy of black history month. \\n\\nTL;DR I did my black history project on a white guy and didn’t realize until the day before it was due, resulting in me having to redo my work.\\n\\nEdit: Though Cormack was born in South Africa, he became a US citizen early in his career. That\\'s why he was on the list of African Americans. I guess this is three decades in the making but I only discovered it Saturday, so it feels like a very fresh FU.\\n\\nThis weekend I was eating a sandwich with some extra sharp parmigiano-reggiano cheese flakes on it and I made the comment over voice chat with my friends that it was so good but so sharp it was tearing up my mouth. I had a momentary pause before a chorus of puzzled friends chimed in at the same time to ask me to elaborate.\\n\\n\"You know, it\\'s extra sharp. It really cuts and burns my gums and the roof of my mouth.\"\\n\\nAnd that\\'s when my friends informed me that none of them have this reaction, and futhermore, *no one* has this reaction. I hear several keyboards going at once with people having alt-tabbed to google around and our best webmd-style guess is that I have an allergic reaction to some histamines common in sharp cheeses, and that I\\'ve had this reaction for *thirty years*, and that I always assumed *everyone* had it. \\n\\n\"What the hell do you mean when you call it a *sharp* cheese if THAT\\'S not what you\\'re talking about?!\"\\n\\nI figured the mild-sharp spectrum for cheeses was like the mild-hot spectrum for spicy foods. I love spicy foods. I love sharp cheeses. I thought they were the same kind of thing where they were supposed to hurt you a little bit. Apparently \"sharp\" just means \"flavorful\" or \"tangy.\"\\n\\nTL;DR: I have an allergy to some cheese protein and for 30 years I\\'ve been thinking that sharp cheese is supposed to sting. Throwaway, because I don\\'t want to become a notorious couch fucker on reddit.\\n\\nThis happened last week on Saturday, because Saturday and Sunday is my father\\'s custody time for me. Saturday is also my dad\\'s day off from his steel delivery job, but it all started when my dad got \"called into work\" for a few hours because some guy had called off sick and he had to fill for him.\\n\\nThis made me think about all the possible (private) things I could do to anything around the house. Then I saw; **the $700 LEATHER COUCH**. I executed my plan. \\nMaterials needed: Dish soap, a couch, and rags\\n\\nI started with the dish soap, applying it to the creases within the leather couch. Then, I put rags under the area of attack to prevent drippage. Then, the couch bestiality commenced. Lemme tell ya, it was pretty fuckin good for the about amount of virgin I am, and there was no turning back. \\n\\nAnother detail about my dad getting called into work is that I was inside the couch about 2-3 hours after he left. On a usual workday, he gets off at 3:30, but arrives home at 4. \\n\\nNot today\\n\\nHe left at 9:30 am for work, and I was doing the dirty at like 12 pm, which I felt was an appropriate time because he supposedly wasn\\'t supposed to come home for another 3-4 hours. Then it **happened**. The couch is about 10 feet from the front door, and within eyesight\\n\\n[here](https://imgur.com/wi2nz1Q) is a very crude drawing of the living room.\\n\\nI heard the deadbolt jiggling and my heart went down my throat. The knob turns, and the door opens to reveal a butt ass naked me, balls deep in his very expensive and luxury couch. He gave me a stare that could kill 20 men and mouthed the words \"what the fuck are you doing\". I couldn\\'t decide what to do, so I just put my clothes on and started cleaning right there with the rags I stuffed in the couch, while saying very quietly \"sorry^sorry^sorry\". He walked back out but before he shut the door, he said \"don\\'t clean that; im throwing it away, now.\". The rest of the day was extremely awkward: couch behind us while we sat on table chairs, while we watched tv and not saying anything to each other.\\n\\nTL;DR: Fucked my dads couch with some soap and he came home earlier than expected \\n\\nEDIT: Typo\\n\\nEDIT NO.2: HOLY SHIT YALL BLEW THIS UP.\\nI really, really, REALLY appreciate the gold; regardless if this is a throwaway or not. My couch fucking earned me a dollar and I\\'m proud! obligatory \"this happened a couple weeks ago\"\\n\\nSo me (21m) and my best friend (22m) have been best friends since high school. We\\'re from the same town, and went to high school together, but ended up going to different colleges. Anyways, I\\'m super close with his entire family to the point of when summers come around, I end up spending entire days over at his house, sometimes when no one\\'s there. His family counts me as part of their own family.\\n\\nSo his sister (24f) posted a story on instagram about her texting her boyfriend (23m) asking for help with a word puzzle. It was one of those \"even when I\\'m sick and can\\'t hang out, I still need help with word puzzles\" things. Classic couple. Well I take it on myself to figure out the puzzle. So I swipe up and I\\'m thinking of what it could be, when I realize the letters could spell out \"nudes.\" Eventually, I send it off as \"nudes? lol\" and put my phone away, thinking she\\'ll realize what I mean and maybe she\\'ll also be glad for the help.\\n\\nA few minutes later, I get a message from an old coworker of mine (26f) that says \"oh my!!\" I think to myself, \"well that\\'s weird, I haven\\'t talked to her in forever\" so I open up Instagram. Turns out, while I had been sitting and trying to figure out the puzzle, Instagram had cycled through to the next person\\'s story, which belonged to my former coworker who just so happened to have posted a picture of her 3yo son. My heart immediately sunk. I realized my mistake, and went straight into panic mode, showing screenshots of my best friend\\'s sister\\'s story and the like. She said she understood, but at the very best she figures that I was asking someone else for nudes and made up an elaborate story to cover up.\\n\\nTL;DR Was trying to help a friend with a puzzle on instagram and thought the answer was \"nudes\" so I accidentally sent \"nudes? lol\" to a former coworker who had posted a picture of her 3yo son.\\n\\nEdit: thank you for my first silver!\\n\\nEdit: and gold!! Thank you I had 4 years of ROTC in high school and 2 Semesters of American History. (2 separate teachers) So, not a history major, but I have absorbed a lot of material on the Civil War. And I realized today that it was horseshit and I got hoodwinked.\\n\\nBefore that, like most people, when someone asked me why the Civil War happened, my answer would have been \"slavery\". And that definitely was an issue. But my teachers presented it as thought it was not the forefront issue. They gave me a lot of info--what the economy was like and what other industries aside from slavery were doing, how industry was just taking off in the North, what Europe was doing and why that was important, etc. --There was a lot. And it made sense, because I found it very believable that politicians and businessmen were doing underhanded shit and trying to hide it behind or around the slavery issue. So they essentially presented me with the idea that slavery was not the main reason for the civil war, it was business. Again, super plausible. This was all being presented with an attitude of \"Now let me tell you what REALLY happened\". \\n\\nIm SIX semesters of this shit, no one had even mentioned the Declarations of Secession, the actual physical documents the states wrote when they left. I had no idea they existed. I read them all today, and holy shit that stuff reads like a dystopian nightmare. They were ALL about slavery and how it was \"the greatest institution ever conceived\" and that it had to be protected. There\\'s no way this wasn\\'t THE forefront issue, after reading those papers. I messaged some friends who had the same class to make sure i wasn\\'t remembering wrong and, I wasn\\'t. I told them of my discovery, they had never heard of the Secession declarations either. Ugh.\\n\\nReddit let me know earlier how absolutely wrong I was. I don\\'t care about people calling me dumb, I\\'ll own that. I just trusted my teachers to give me facts, and I got this...propaganda. I am disgusted with myself for carrying around incorrect information for so long. I hope my stupidity is isolated, but I wonder how many people are out there thinking they know something but actually don\\'t? \\n\\nTL;DR I thought the Civil War was about slavery, my history teachers convinced me that it wasn\\'t, then reddit proved them (and me) totally wrong as fuck.\\n\\nEDIT: The FU part of this is that it took me making an ignorant post on a other forum and getting blasted by the Reddit community about how completely stupid I was for me to learn about the documents, or the Cornerstone speech. Which I guess is fair, I dunno. It hurt my feelings, but it shook loose the truth for me.\\n\\n>http://www.civil-war.net/pages/ordinances_secession.asp This happened earlier today and I\\'m pretty sure I\\'m on a police watch list now.\\n\\nNeeded to pick up a few things from my local hardware store I was running low on that I like to have around. Zip ties, duck tape, and things for quick repairs. \\n\\nWhile I was there I noticed they were having a store wide sale. I\\'m an avid outdoorsmen and with hunting season coming up I like to keep certain back up items in my truck if I need them. I figured I would grab some things while they are on sale.\\n\\nWalking through the isles I start randomly grabbing items I think I might need for my kit. Such as a tarp, some rope, large knife, headlamp, latex gloves, and a lantern with extra batteries.\\n\\nKeep in mind I already have zip ties and duct tape in my cart when I walk up to the register. These are things I generally purchase, buy never all at once.\\n\\nGirl at the register greets me as I start placing items on the counter. I give her my number for rewards points and she quickly starts scanning things.\\n\\nAbout half way through she slows down a bit. She looks down at my already bagged items, at the stuff left on the counter, and then back to me. I\\'m just standing there waiting with my wallet in hand, clueless as to what is now processing in her head.\\n\\nThen we have a light convo that in hindsight prob made things worse:\\n\\nHer: \"Wow that\\'s a big knife.\"\\nMe: \"Yeah I like having cheap, throwaway knives around. Same with tarps and stuff too.\"\\nStares at me funny after my reply as she scans knife.\\n\\nHer: \"Can I see your ID to verify your at least 18 to purchase this.\"\\nMe being 30, going bald, and grey in my beard looks at her weird as I\\'ve never been asked for my ID here. Pull it out and hand it to her. \\n\\nShe quickly looks at my ID info and then glances up at her screen where I noticed my reward info was pulled up. Didn\\'t think anything of it at the time.\\n\\nShe says thanks, hands it back while still looking at it, and finishes scanning my items. Almost looking like she was taking inventory of what I had.\\n\\nShe gives me my total and I hand her some cash (prob another red flag, no paper trail.)\\n\\nI get my change, grab my bags, and head for the door. She yells back don\\'t forget your receipt as she walks it over to me. I grab it as I notice her quickly glance up at the security camera in front of the door.\\nI say thanks and leave thinking that whole situation was weird.\\n\\nI get home and start unpacking my bags to sort stuff out on my kitchen table when my wife comes up behind me. She glances at my items and jokingly asks if she should be worried.\\n\\nI was like what? Still clueless. Before she points out that it looks like I\\'m about to go tie someone up and murder them.\\n\\nGirl at register must have thought the same thing. Checked my info and I\\'m pretty sure made sure she got my face on the security camera in case someone pops up murdered on the news later.\\n\\nTold my wife about cashier and she about died laughing at me for being so clueless.\\n\\nTL;DR: \\nBought zip ties, duct tape, knife, tarp, rope, and other questionable items randomly for hunting season on sale at my local hardware store. Pretty sure cashier thought I was a serial killer. Poilce don\\'t seem super well liked on reddit but what the hell. This happened a few weeks ago.\\n\\nI woke up one morning at 5:00 A.M. tired as fuck. I put my uniform, checked my gear, kissed my sleeping wife, and slowly walked to my patrol car parked in front of my apartment building, probably looking like a stereotypical zombie in a police uniform that you might see on TV or in a video game.\\n\\nI started my normal routine: Got in the car, turned on the radar, checked on duty, and started playing music from the best \"prepare for a police shift\" album of all time: \"The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim OST\". Now for my 15 minute commute to the city.\\n\\nMy vehicle was getting low on gas so I stopped at my favorite gas station to fill up, and went inside for my daily breakfast burrito. I went in, put my Sausage, Egg, and Cheese burrito in a paper tray, and grabbed all the needed hot sauces. Then I grabbed a cup and filled it with water, just like I do as the beginning of every shift. After this, still in zombie mode, and went back to my patrol vehicle with the goodies and continued on with my day.\\n\\nAt about noon, I get a call from my Sergeant, who simply said \"I need to talk to you at the department.\"\\n\\nOblivious as to why he would need to talk to me, I began heading to the police department. Millions of thoughts rushed through my head, all wondering what he would want to discuss with me. Upon my arrival, I was directed to my Lieutenant\\'s office. When I walked in, I heard a stern, \"Close the door\". At this point I knew this wasn\\'t good. I sat down, disturbed as fuck, being stared down by my Corporal. Sergeant, and Lieutenant.\\n\\nAfter a preface from my Sergeant, he says, \"Tell me everything that happened this morning, especially at the gas station.\\n\\nI didn\\'t say anything, just sat there and thought about it again. \"Aaawww.......shit. I forgot to pay for my burrito.\" Then I just heard \"Guess what, that\\'s theft.\"\\n\\nAfter a \"Come to Jesus\" moment with my superiors, I left, went straight to the gas station, and paid for my burrito. They didn\\'t want to press charges.\\n\\nAlthough nothing really came of this incident, the shitty part of this is I can\\'t go back and fix what that looked like to the other customers. All they saw was what looked like an entitled cop not paying for a burrito. \\n\\nOn a lighter tone, Now other officers have nicknamed me \"The Burrito Burglar\" and jokingly ask for tips on how to steal stuff when I see them.\\n\\nTl;dr: I\\'m a police officer. Walked into a gas station I go into every morning and, being in \"autopilot\" mode, I walked out with the same burrito I get every morning, and forgot to pay for it. Throw away for obvious reasons.\\n\\nI\\'ll try to keep this short as there isn\\'t much to say. Our medical school class has to do sensitive exams (pelvic, genital, rectal) toward the end of our second year, right before we are allowed to go into the hospital wards. The idea is that these people are paid to have the sensitive exams done, each person has 15-20 students examine them. The vast majority of the time the people getting the exams done are elderly or former healthcare workers who are comfortable with their bodies, want to help educate students, and make some money at the same time. The patient our group had was an uncharacteristically young woman, she was probably in her mid twenties. This shouldn\\'t have been an issue at all, but my medical school class is very conservative, nearly half is already married and the other half is still waiting to have sex until marriage. At least three guys in my group had probably never seen a vagina, let alone touched one. This made the experience way more awkward than it had to be for the patient. Anyway, we do the exam, thank our patient for volunteering her time, and leave for the day.\\n\\nFast forward about 4 weeks to yesterday, I\\'m at the grocery store buying some oatmeal. And I see a young wman near the cereal. She looks familiar but I can\\'t quite figure out where I\\'ve seen her before. I know with 100% certainty I\\'ve seen her, just not sure where. She looks at me and makes eye contact, not the polite eye contact you make, smile, and look away. The type of eye contact where it\\'s prolonged, like she was also trying to figure out where she saw me. We both smile and I walk toward her. The exchange was basically this.\\n\\n**Me:** \"Hey, you look super familiar, where have I seen you before?\"\\n\\n**Her:** \"I was thinking the same thing, I\\'m not sure. Are you from *insert city we\\'re in.\"*\\n\\n**Me:** \"No, I\\'m just here for school.\"\\n\\n**Her:** \"Oh, I just graduated from *local univeristy.* What are you studying maybe we\\'ve had a class together.\"\\n\\n**Me:** \"Oh I don\\'t go to *local university,* I\\'m a medical student at *different campus.\"*\\n\\nIt was at that moment I realized I had fucked up. We both immediately stop smiling. We both instantly knew exactly where we had met before. I have no idea why, but instead of trying to diffuse the situation and acknowledge the humor in what just happened, my dumb-ass-awkward-self thought it was a good time to say \"wait a minute, this isn\\'t the canned food isle.\" And I just walked away.\\n\\nGod, please kill me and end my misery.\\n\\n**TL;DR:** Examined someone\\'s vagina in medical school, ran into her at the grocery store later. We both recognized each other but couldn\\'t remember where from. While talking we both immediately figured it out.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: as u/squirrelybitch and u/azellnir pointed out I shouldn\\'t have been so awkward about sex or the encounter in general. And I completely agree, society in general treats the human body as some taboo that shouldn\\'t be talked about. The reason we were both so awkward was because as doctors we are trained to never initiate contact with our patients in public. If they are the first ones to recognize you, that\\'s fine, you can say hello back, but we can never admit or even imply they are our patients. So just the whole situation where we were both completely caught off guard and didn\\'t expect to have encountered each other in a clinical setting. So this actually happened almost four years ago now and will need just a little back-story.\\n\\nI visited Thailand in September \\'15 as part of a (still on-going) trip around the world, this was via a tour group and so, to keep the budget low, we were often put into shared rooms. This meant that trying to jerk off was a little bit of a problem, and I never felt OK jerking off in shared bathrooms/showers, so I decided to just not bother for the duration of the trip. I was there for a month and this happened during week three, so you can imagine, my cajones were a little heavy by this point and my libido was getting just a tad ravenous.\\n\\nOne morning whilst enjoying the sporadic sun between the monsoons on Koh Samui, I decided to strip down to by boxer shorts and plunge into the warm ocean instead of heading back to my room and changing into my swimming shorts. After a little splash around I used the outdoor shower to wash the saltwater off and put my sweatpants on with no underwear, I didn\\'t think much of it. I then proceeded to drink a fairly decent amount of beer and gorged myself on plates of delicious Pad Thai.\\n\\nI suffer from ongoing back pains, so when I hit Thailand I took full advantage of their cheap massage houses. Now, considering how vulgar my username is, I am actually bit of a prude. I didn\\'t want any \"rug and tug\" situations, in all honesty it just does nothing for me once I start visualising how many other dicks those hands have played around with you know? Not that I\\'m chastising anyone who does enjoy that, its just not my cuppa tea. So, after being a little drunk and full of food I decided to go to a nearby massage parlour and to get my near-daily full-body rub down.\\n\\nThis wasn\\'t one of those sleazy parlours you see dotted around everywhere, not a hint of neon lighting or blacked out windows, it was small and a tad ramshackle but was obviously a classier establishment. I went in and there was one woman working, it was otherwise entirely devoid of anyone else. I asked for the same as always, paid up in advance (in case she thought I was after anything \"extra\") and got ready. It was only when I started taking my sweatpants off that I remembered that I was free-balling, I explained to the lovely young lady my dilemma and offered to just roll up my trousers but she just handed me an extra towel and turned around whilst I awkwardly positioned myself on my stomach with a towel under me and another over my arse.\\n\\nThe first half of the massage went well, it was actually one of the best ones I\\'d had by this point, she seemed to pinpoint a lot of my knots and just went to town on them (I\\'m a big fan of more aggressive massages), I was in absolute bliss. Then came the time for the front. Look, by this point I had been massaged by young women, elderly women, flamboyantly gay men, miserable old men, lady-boys and everything in-between, in every single instance each one of them had \"awoken the beast\" to some level or another. With this massage I was at absolute full-mast. One of those \"I\\'ve not jerked off in three weeks\", my dick actually aches type of stonkers. I apologised profusely because no towel in the world was gonna hide that particular beast. She laughed and started working on my legs, I started relaxing a bit more, I imagined it was nothing she hadn\\'t seen before (my dick is a bit overweight but not particularly long) and tried to settle back down and enjoy it. She went up the thigh and nudged by nuts with the kind of delicate touch I imagine a pixie would have, my helmet popped out from under the towel in an almost mocking manner. I went to pull the towel back up a little more but she did as well and in doing so managed to stroke just the tip of my cock.\\n\\nCum fired out of my dick with such ferocity that I thought I\\'d broken something, a load of it shot on her hand, a lot went all over my chest but I also decided to try and sit up at the same time and another hot wad of baby batter shot itself all over the massage bed, the floor and on her forearm. All the while I\\'m desperately trying to apologise, mopping up my seed whilst still emptying both barrels in a confusing mixture of ecstasy and despair. Mostly despair. After a short while, the fireworks were over. There was a pregnant pause, she looked neither angry or sad, just a little bewildered. I realised that I\\'d been using both her fresh towels to mop up my mess and was just this Gollum-esque, butt-naked creature awkwardly perched on her massage bed, covered in cum and probably reeking of alcohol who up until recently had been screaming apologies in-between the occasional gasps of joy. Wordlessly I put my clothes on, not making eye contact, I pulled my wallet out and gave her about 1500 Baht (the massage cost 200 to put that into perspective) and slowly slunk out. I often wonder if she talks about this absolutely fucked up situation.\\n\\nEdit - Typos  \\n\\n\\nEdit 2 - After desperately trying to reply to as many of the posts as I could, I received a notification that I\\'d hit the front page. So, I guess its gonna take me a while longer than anticipated to get back to y\\'all, I still need to work too. In all honesty, I wrote up this event because I had been told I had to during one of the many times I have regaled people with it. I had spent all day yesterday just writing incredibly downbeat stuff and decided to take a break and to quickly scribble up something a little more jovial, more for myself than anything else, thinking that it would maybe make a few people chuckle and was pretty harmless, so I posted it typos and all. I did not ever expect this response, its really lifted my spirits and I am grateful beyond words. Every little complement and giggle is doing more good than I think most people would realise. Thank you.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL; DR - Got a massage whilst forgetting my underwear, ended up shooting my wad all over myself, a poor masseuse and her equipment in a furious display of penile theatrics. This happened about 20 min ago.\\n\\nSo last night my girlfriend and I decided to go out to the bars. Got very drunk and stumbled back to my place and starting doing the deed. Recently, we decided to be adventurous and invested in some butt plugs for her. Well last night was the first time we decided to use them. We read online that using lube makes putting the plugs in easier, so that we did. Everything went well but afterwards we couldn’t find the plug. This is where the TIFU begins. \\n\\nWe figured the butt plug must have just fallen out or something so we went to sleep and we would find it in the morning. Woke up hungover and went to get food, entirely forgetting about the plug. GFs stomach has been hurting so we just figured she’s a little extra hungover no big deal. We arrive at McDs to get some greasy hangover food. I order while GF heads to the bathroom to hopefully resolve her stomach issue. As i take our order back to our table, GF walks over in a panic saying we need to leave NOW.\\n\\nShe found the butt plug. In our drunken state, we managed to put the ENTIRE thing in her ass. Handle and all. And now it’s sitting at the bottom of a McDonalds toilet in all its glory. \\n\\nTl;dr: Did not use a butt plug as directed. I won AirPods in a raffle a couple months ago and decided to give them a try last night. Overall, I wasn’t a fan of them and prefer to use my wired earphones. I asked my mom if she wanted them and she gladly accepted. \\n\\nI work nights and got home around 6:30am this morning, I get to my room and decide to wank one out before I fall asleep. I turn on a nice video and get to work. Halfway through, the sound stops, so I try turning up the volume with no success. As I’m trying to figure out why the sound stopped, I see the tiny earphone symbol in the corner of my screen. I quickly realize that my mom is getting ready for her morning walk and put the AirPods in her ears and heard my nice video... on full blast. \\n\\nLater that day she gave me back the AirPods and said she didn’t like them either. \\n\\nTL;DR: Gave my mom my old AirPods without realizing they were still connected by Bluetooth to my phone and she heard the the porn I was watching at 6:30am on full blast. So, this didn’t happen today but a few months ago, but I never told anyone. It’s a long story so you can find a TLDR at the end. \\n\\nA while back the company I was working for was tearing out and removing an old waste treatment system that was shut down in the ’70s. This was basically a massive underground pit where the waste solids (aka shit) would settle on the bottom of the chamber and the liquids would be pumped out. The thing is when they shut it down it was left full of shit and is by far one of the nastiest jobs I have ever done. \\n\\nWe opened the pit up by tearing off the top with equipment and were bringing in trucks to pump out the waste the pit was about 16 feet deep and filled to the top with solids. And when I’m talking solids, I’m taking shit tons and tons of shit, condoms, and for some reason pumpkin seeds which I still don’t understand to this day.\\n\\nOne weekend we got a bunch of rain. When it rained, we would pump the water out into the new sewer so we could remove the solids. Since it was the weekend and we had so much rain my boss asked me to swing by and turn the pumps on, so the water didn’t get out of hand. \\n\\nSo, I went out to the job site alone to turn on the pumps and suck the water out. When I got to the job site, I turned the pumps on, but they were clogged up. I decided to walk into the structure alone and clear the pumps and that is the start of my fuck up that almost cost me my life. \\n\\nSince I took my personal vehicle, I didn’t have any of my equipment so instead of using a harness I went in without one which is the first fuck up. This structure was underground, and the pit had large chambers that were broken into basically large upside-down V’s that you could walk on the point which was a foot or two wide. When I got down to the pumps and was crouched down cleaning them my phone rang, and I went to answer it and that was my second fuck up. Being crouched I had to turn my leg and try to get my phone out of my pocket and my foot slipped on some gravel and I slipped off the ledge and fell in. At this point, I didn’t really wasn’t worried about anything besides the fact that I just landed in straight 40-year-old shit up to my knees, however, when I tried to move to get to the edge to get out, I started to sink. Like I said this pit was 16-foot-deep and it was like being in quicksand. I tried to reach for the edge, but it was just out of reach and when I tried to move again, I was now a little over my waist-deep. At this point, I was still fine yes, I was covered in shit but normally the city work guy comes around once or twice a day to check the site so just chill there wait for him to come and he can get me out. Sure, I’m going to be embarrassed more than likely to get in trouble, but I would be fine. The thing is while I stood there covered in shit, I noticed that I was still sinking and that’s when the panic set in. I couldn’t wait I had to get out or I was going to die, I was going to drown in 40-year-old human shit my whole life had led to me drowning in shit. So I instantly tried to get out I tried to kick my way out, I tried to pull myself out, I tried to swim on the top of it all while sinking deeper and deeper and nothing but the thought of the absolute crazy way that I was going to die. \\n\\nAt this point, I had sunk to my chest and I had pretty much lost all hope and had started to accept my fate and broke into a combination of historical laughter and cursing myself for my stupidity of going down there with a harness. I finally calmed down while I’m reading the wrapper for a condom from like the ’60s and I noticed a piece of rebar sticking out of one of the walls that we had started to tear down. I reached out and stretched myself out more than I ever think I’ve done in my life and was able to grab it. With every ounce of my strength, I managed to pull myself free, and then pull myself to the edge and get out.\\n\\nI got out of the pit and fell on the ground and looked up at the sky and laid there covered in shit and smelling worse than I ever did in my life and laughed. I was alive, my story had not ended by drowning in shit. \\n\\nI got up found a water hose and washed myself off. I threw my clothes away and drove home naked and took what was the best and longest shower of my life and never told a soul how close I came to drown in 40-year-old shit. \\n\\nTLDR\\n\\nI went out to a sewage treatment plant alone without a harness tried to answer my phone and fell in a pit and almost drowned in human shit. Not actually today, but yesterday. \\n\\nBut first, some background. \\n\\nMy almost 8 year old son with autism will fixate on certain things he hears (and the more related to body parts or functions the more he fixates) and repeat them. Over. And over. And over.\\n\\nOn the day in question I sat down on the couch and started watching The Office. My kids love it so they eventually all ended up in the living room with me watching. The episode in question was one where Michael and Dwight trick Jim in to driving with them to the Utica branch to \"prank\" them for trying to steal one of their employees. During the drive Dwight pees in to an empty soda can in the back seat. Michael notices and starts driving badly which causes Dwight to loose his balance and eventually say \"I think I cut my penis on the lid!\" \\n\\nI think you probably know where this is going. \\n\\nThe rest of that day and today my son repeated that line approximately 8 thousand times. He\\'s still saying it to anyone in ear shot, including the neighbor kids and my super conservative mother. There\\'s also nothing I can do about it. Bringing attention to it will just make it go on longer, so I just have to wait until it loses its comedic effect and wait for the next, highly inappropriate but hilarious phrase he decides to fixate on. Hoping by the time he goes to therapy tomorrow night he will have stopped saying it. Fingers crossed. \\n\\nTl;dr: my autistic son heard a line from the office that said \"I think I cut my penis on the lid!\" and won\\'t stop repeating it to anyone and everyone within ear shot.\\n\\nEdit: first of all, holy smokes, I didn\\'t think this would get the amount of attention it\\'s getting and I\\'m totally blown away! Front page! Wow. Thank you for those of you who gave me awards and shared similar stories. I\\'ve loved reading them all! When I saw it getting so much attention it really made my night!\\n\\nSecond, it was pointed out by someone (sorry, I don\\'t have time right now to find the comment and credit you, but I will later when I have more time to go back through the comments) that the correct usage is \"person with autism\" so I edited the body of the post to reflect that, thank you for the gentle reminder. \\n\\nThird, to all the people telling me I\\'m not a good parent or telling me that I shouldn\\'t be letting my kids watch the office I just have one thing to say: you are a thief of joy.\\n\\nEdit 2: so I guess I should have looked more in to it before editing. The majority of replies have said that the preferred way to say it is \"person who is autistic\" or that it should be up to the individual on the autism spectrum to decided. So, I\\'m just going to leave it as is, but thank you all who have commented kindly on the topic. Bitchhh, I owe you an UPDATE.\\n\\nGood news, there’s so much staring at the ceiling one can do before pure boredom kicks in and the realization that the desire to scream “fuck fuck fuck” at the top of your lungs will most likely not last for an eternity. Bad news, you guys did me dirty by blasting my still fresh embarrassment  on the front page and apparently on a famous Portuguese radio show this morning. Cool, cool, cool. \\n\\nSo, on to the meaty love update. Once I realized the text blunder, I quickly texted him that it was not meant for him, with a crying emoji for good measure. Sweet, sweet man that he is, he responded immediately to let me know that he “doesn’t read texts not meant for him 😉”. I subsequently asked for permission to die. Uh uh, he said. “Please don’t 😘”.\\n\\nThis morning, he texted me about some travel plans we have down the line. Bless this handsome man. The Gods are cruel, but not that cruel. \\n\\nThis is where I should clarify that the original post was obviously a tad hyperbolic (just like that text, go figure). I slept well last night, and I also laughed. At myself, the blunder, just the ridiculous timing. What also got imprinted on me was that exact moment I wrote and sent that text. The moment he leaned and kissed me good night, I looking at him as I closed my apartment door, locking it and at once turning around and heavily sighing and smiling, keys still in hand. \\n\\nTwo weeks ago, he had proposed going on a walk at the park. I had an inkling somehow that after knowing each other for three years, he was going to finally, perhaps, become vulnerable and share a few things. I had been in a serious relationship when we met, and, what I know now to be out of respect and my iron clad boundaries, he never made any advances. But I was single now, and at the park, sitting there, together, he looked at me and said he had feelings for me. Long time, three-year long feelings. And right there at Prospect Park, on a clear night, under some 35 visible stars (we counted), he kissed me. Last night, it was my turn to be vulnerable, even if accidentally. \\n\\nFor once, I think I understand Ted. He was always the guy I wanted to throw my shoe at whenever his ridiculous face showed up on the screen (which was a lot).\\n\\nAs for the “library”, I’m not Jane Austen, but I’m a New Yorker, and the luxury of ample space is not something I recognize. My dream as a child refugee, growing up in deep poverty, was to have a dedicated place for all the books I could buy when I would grow up and have money. Here’s a pic of my library nook that I built through vintage thrifting, DIY projects and patience: [The “Library”](https://imgur.com/gallery/20IAaXU) \\n\\n\\nThis is it, folks. The update. \\nI might prefer this life over any rom-com. \\n\\n—————-\\n\\nThis just happened to me. Literally 10 minutes ago. I am dying. I am dead. End me now, O Holy Ghost. \\n\\n\\nI thought this only happened in some poorly written rom-coms. The kind where life hardly imitates the real one. I want to bury myself and never come to see the light again. Why me? Oh, why me?! \\n\\nTen painfully long minutes ago, I, exalted by the wonderful date I went with this handsomely gorgeous man who also happened to be a friend of mine for the last three years, against my apartment door that I had just closed on his beautiful face, I typed these words that will fiercely haunt me now : “ Bitchhhh, I think I’m going to end up marrying this guy!”. \\n\\nThis was meant for my best friend, the only other soul I could muster to express my vulnerable feelings. \\n\\nI sent this deeply poetic text to him instead. \\n\\nDo you think there is a void big enough in this planet to hold all my misery? All the embarrassment? \\n\\nDo you think I can make a pact with the devil to turn back time? I would just need 10 minutes. That’d be really nice. \\n\\nCan I please die now? Literal and metaphorical death is the only relief I might know.\\n\\nI am currently in my library, sprawled across the floor intently starring at the ceiling. Man, I think I’ll be here forever.\\n\\nTL;DR - I mistakenly texted my date that I might end up marrying him as we just ended our date. Realized too late the text meant for my best friend was sent to him instead. I got an early Xmas card with a $50 bill in it.  I put the bill in my wallet until I could get to the bank in a couple days\\n\\nOn my way home, I stopped at a sit-down restaurant and tipped my waitress with a five-dollar bill...you know where this is going, don\\'t you?  The waitress was surprised and very happy and thankful, which I thought was a bit over the top for what amounted to about a 30% tip.\\n\\nComes time to deposit the $50 and guess what, it\\'s nowhere to be found.  After puzzling for several days over where I might have put it, the neurons fire, the connection is made, and I realize that I had to have given it to the waitress, which would explain her reaction.\\n\\nWell, shit!  I hope she really needed it and I hope it was a blessing, but all I can think is I\\'m a dumbass.\\n\\nTL;DR  I was given a $50 bill which I gave to a waitress by accident, thinking it was a $5 bill, and I\\'m a dumbass.\\n\\nEdit: thank you all for the kind words, as well as the silver and gold.  Thanks too for the silly comments that made me laugh.  \\n\\nClearing up a few points:\\n\\nMy bill was a bit less than $15.  I *thought* I was leaving a $5 bill (about a 30% tip) but instead I left a $50 bill.\\n\\nI\\'m American.  All our bills are the same color and size.  Its extraordinarily rare that I\\'ve ever had a 50 dollar bill. Yes, yes, I acknowledge that those countries with different size / color paper money are onto something monumental.\\n\\nI\\'m a woman, grandma-aged, with grey hair and poor eyesight.  Not a dude.  In my college years I was a waitress, so I\\'m well aware of the hard work and the struggle.\\n\\nThe loss of the money is not a hardship by any means, but thank you to those kind-hearted souls who offered to reimburse me - your kindness made me want to cry.  I was just feeling so stupid for having made such an easy mistake.\\n\\nI do indeed believe in karma, and I hope that the $50 helped fill some of her needs.  The karma has already come back to me in the well wishes given here by my fellow Redditors.\\n\\nAs for all those commenting about losing money in a strip club in a similar way, Imma shake my head and say tsch tsch in a grandmotherly way. Tonight I fucked up. \\nI was outside smoking a cigarette in my pajamas. Everyone else was asleep. \\nIt\\'s a bit rainy and chilly, if that matters.\\nAnyway, I felt something like a lump in my slipper. I took it off, shook it.. nothing came out. \\n\\nThen I felt something, very subtle, near my ankle. I reached down, but couldn\\'t locate it. \\nI tried to ignore it but kept feeling these tiny wiggles. I started panicking, thinking it was a spider. I began slapping my leg. At one point by my knee I felt a little lump, and that sent me running into the house screaming. (I am very afraid of spiders).\\n\\nI burst into my sisters room, turned her light on and removed my pants, all while shouting that something is in my pants my She woke up screaming- scared at my sudden intrusion. \\nThe dogs promptly ran into her room, as well, confused.\\n\\nI tossed my pants at her and just kept shouting \\'something in my pants!\\'. She first said it was nothing, then at my prompting she shook my pants (sweatpants). Nothing happened, she told me \\'it\\'s nothing, see? Goodnight.\\' \\n\\nI was relieved. I went to grab my pants again, to put them on ( I had been wearing no underwear under my pants, not my best decision).\\n\\nAnd my sister started screaming. I look and clinging into the crotch of the sweatpants was a fucking MOUSE. I tossed the pants at her because, well, I panicked. \\n\\nWe were shouting at each other, both saying do something! The dogs were barking at the confusion. Finally, our parents entered the room. We just shouted at them that there was a mouse. \\n\\nMy father was like ok. And my mom asked why I wasn\\'t wearing pants and then I started shouting it\\'s in my pants! All over again.\\n\\nWe put the mouse outside. It was very much alive. \\n\\n\\nTL;DR  tonight I fucked up because a mouse was in my pants.\\n\\nEdit: So first of all I am still amazed at how much attention this received. I posted this after my family went back to bed, while I drank a hot tea to calm down a bit. I figured maybe a couple of people would upvote or comment, based on my experiences posting in the past.. When I checked Reddit this morning I was overwhelmed with the amount of comments and attention my experience  got. I showed this to my sister and she had me send this post to her. She absolutely loved it. \\n\\nI would like to address a few things brought up in the comments:\\n  I am a woman. I wasn\\'t wearing underwear, but I was wearing an over sized tee shirt that covered my vulva- only part of my butt was exposed. \\n\\nI am not sure why the mouse freaked me out so much. I think probably because a mouse was the last critter I expected to see. \\n\\nI am an adult (probably makes this fuck up worse) who currently lives with my parents because of financial and personal issues. I left an abusive spouse  and am working on a divorce. \\n\\nMy family and my sister are still laughing about last nights scenario. My dad had his own mouse experience when I was a  kid which he brought up today when the mouse in my pants was discussed at thanksgiving dinner. We went ice skating with my dad when my sisters and I were little and he suddenly exited the rink. He removed his hockey skate and a mouse ran out. All the kids sitting on the benches getting ready to go skate were shouting about the mouse. My dad said he felt like the skate was tighter than it should have been. Today he told me \\'welcome to the club\\' and high fived me, haha. \\n\\nAnd I have been enjoying reading everyones own stories about critters who got to close for comfort! So this happened a last year but was just reminded of the story so I thought I’d post. \\n\\nI work in a small sales company and report to the chief operating officer. Both of us have worked for the company for several years and have a great relationship. She’s was 41 and I was 29 at the time this happened, both happily married. Her name is Kate and my wife’s name is Kari, similar names on my phone...\\n\\nSo, I usually stay late in the office to get myself ahead for the next day. Usually her and I are the last to leave the office.\\n\\nThis was one of those occasions and she texted me she was leaving and to go out the back door. In the meantime, my wife was going on a trip with her sister the following morning and she was texting me about some stuff to pick up from the store in the way home. I jokingly texted her “ok but we need to fuck before you go.” \\n\\nMe half paying attention to my phone I accidentally texted that to my boss after she had said she was leaving for the day.....talk about matching the context perfectly. But it was too late.....Verizon’s 4G network shot that into the sky and in her inbox before I could pray to Jesus to take it back. \\n\\nI realized what I had just done and said to her before she responded “Kate...I don’t expect you to understand, but that was for my wife.....”\\n\\nI could hear her laughing from across the office and she responded to the text “try again, I’m out of you’re league ;) I’ll see you Monday” \\n\\nSo yeah, story for the grandkids about grandpa being a dumbass.\\n\\nTL;DR: was having a conversation with my boss and wife at the same time and accidentally texted my boss a sexual advance.\\n\\nEdit: wow I didn’t expect this to blow up like it did.  Yeah my boss is very relaxed and I work for a great company. We’re all cool with each other for the most part. Jury is still out whether I could smash though.... Disclaimer : This happened 4 years ago when I just moved to the Netherlands. I come from South Africa and my native language (Afrikaans) is very similar to Dutch.  We have alot of similar words but sometimes the same word that looks, sounds and is spelt the same, means something totally different.\\n\\nSo the first few months I lived in the Netherlands, I picked up some Dutch and eagerly showed it off where ever I could. One afternoon I decided to go treat myself with a nice meal at a local Dutch restaurant.\\n\\nA very pretty, blue eyed, blond Dutch girl was my waitress. I tried speaking Dutch to her throughout the meal and everything seemed to be going quite well. At the end of the meal she came to me and asked if there is anything else she could do for me.... And this is where the story takes a bit of a wrong turn.\\n\\nNow I need to just pause here and refer back to my earlier statement about words meaning different things... Well in South Africa if you want the bill you ask \"May I have the *slip* please \" [Mag ek die slip kry asseblief]. Slip obviously refers to the bill.... And we use it in all our 11 languages. So back to the restaurant...\\n\\nSo In Dutch, I confidently respond to her and say \"Mag ik de slip aub\" [May I have the slip please]. \\n\\nShe looks quite perplexed and caught a bit off guard and asks again what I wanted. I repeated myself, this time widening my eyes, trying to smile a bit and placed more emphasis on each word  (as to pronounce it clearly). \"Mag. ik. de. slip. aub!\" [May I have the slip please]. \\n\\nReally uncomfortable she switches over to English and tells me to speak English and tell her what I wanted. So I told her I needed the bill so I can pay and leave. She then burst out in an uncontrollable laughter and asked me if I knew what I had asked her? Apparently *SLIP* in Dutch means g-string / panty!!! So apparently she thought the foreigner wanted to take more than just the doggy bag home with him to enjoy later! \\n\\nNever felt so embarrassed in my life. I paid my bill, gave her a huge tip, and never went back to the restaurant again!\\n\\nTL;DR: TIFU by going to a restaurant, attempting to impress the Dutch waitress with my Dutch ability, and inadvertently asking for her panties when I asked for the bill! Obligatory this happened yesterday and not today. Yesterday I saw a Raccoon walking around outside my apartment, so I took a video of it and put it on my Snapchat story saying “look at this coon over there.” Later in the day, I went to the gym and on the way home, I saw that same Raccoon walking around and climbing a tree. I walked up to about 5 feet away from it and starting talking to it. “Hey little coon, how’s it going? I hope you’re not one of those bad coons thats gonna bite me, or that you’re a rabid coon. That would suck.” Then I walked away. I live in a predominately African American neighborhood, and I got a couple of weird looks from my neighbors. I shrugged it off as the neighbors thinking I was weird for talking to a raccoon, which I am. Anyways, I got inside my apartment and joined my buddies discord server and told him about the raccoon I saw, abbreviating it the way I usually do. He then proceeded to tell me that “coon” is a seriously messed up derogatory term. I felt so bad, my whole life I’ve been calling them that because I always thought it was a shortened version of “raccoon.” I literally yelled out in my apartment “I’m sorry everyone! I’m not racist!” Either way, I feel horrible.\\n\\nTLDR;\\nI learned that you can’t abbreviate Raccoon because it’s a racial slur About two months ago there was a page on the intranet for our company for the location of the corporate quarterly meeting.\\n\\nAs a joke I wrote in Twin Peaks as one of the suggestions.\\n\\nI am guessing the person running it either wanted to see the world burn or thought the restaurant was like the tv show because it was one of the actual voting options on the intranet. The trolls in the company definitely voted it as the pick for the meeting as well as it was the number one option by a HUGE margin.\\n\\nI am guessing there was a failure in understanding of the nature of the restaurant as the entire place was reserved yesterday for the most RSVP\\'s the company ever received for a quarterly meeting.\\n\\nThe day came and everyone showed up for the surreal event. In the ENTIRE process no one informed higher management that twin peaks was like hooters but much much better. The organizer showed up about 2-3 hours before everyone was going to be there and had no clue. The waitresses do not switch into their... ahem, uniforms until it is time to roll.\\n\\nAbout an hour before everyone showed up the waitresses undressed into their uniforms and the organizer realized what kind of establishment this was. By then it was too late. The money was spent, and there was no way to back out now.\\n\\nI have to hand it to upper management. They powered through the meeting while simply ignoring what was happening. Although he did start the meeting with. \"I was going to thank everyone for their enthusiasm for the largest turnout for a quarterly meeting in our company\\'s history, but I think I know why so many of you joined us today.\" This drew a few chuckles from the people at the tables.\\n\\nOther than that one instance, none of the higher management mentioned it and just powered through until the ending where they said they were going to simply choose a place next time and not allow voting.\\n\\nIt took all of 3 hours after the meeting for IT to pinpoint me as the original suggester of the meeting location.\\n\\nI was sent home for the day as they were going to review my employment.\\n\\nI came in this morning and was informed I am to receive a write up for this. They are not firing me as there was an entire series of failures from all levels of management. They understand the humor in my suggestion and would have found it funny, had it not come to the fact that our company had a quarterly meeting at Twin peaks.\\n\\nTL:DR Suggested Twin Peaks as a joke location for meeting. Bosses did not research Twin Peaks at all and we had a quarterly meeting at the location. I got written up for it.  So this happened a couple hours ago. To explain, my fiancé(M28) has a birth defect that affects his kidneys, and we always knew one day that he would need a transplant. We didn’t expect it as soon as we got it though, which was earlier in this week. He starts dialysis Monday. \\nAnyways, in the heat of explaining to me the medical call he had earlier that morning, he said something along the lines of, “I have two years to get the transplant.” \\n\\nThe pessimist in me took that sentence and ran to the darkest depths, thinking “he has two years left of LIFE.” I’ve been a mess for the last two days, and that’s putting it sweetly. \\nSo today, I was pressing him about all the places we needed to apply, ways we could get the word out, etc, and I mentioned that we only had a two year deadline. His face fell into confusion, and he was like, “What?” And I explained to him what I THOUGHT he had explained to me, that he only had bittersweet time left. Let me tell you that this poor man instantly came to me in pure concern, telling me I totally misunderstood and that he, in fact, would not die in two years. \\n\\nI have never felt so happy to be so dumb in my entire life. \\n\\nTL;DR: I misunderstood my fiancé’s diagnosis for a death sentence. It’s not.\\n\\nsmolEDIT: the “two years” thing was apparently just the time frame to reapply to stay on the transplant list! \\n\\nEDIT: HOO BOY I DID NOT EXPECT THIS TO BLOW UP. There were ~100upvotes and a handful of comments on this when I went to bed about 6 hours ago. I’m going to do my best to read through what I can today! I’ve already seen a lot of great insight and information from those in similar situations with transplants and dialysis. I am VERY grateful to all of you. You’ve given me immense comfort and I can’t wait to show my fiancé as well! Thank you all so much. This happened about two hours ago.\\n\\nI\\'ve been extremely stressed as of late and my boyfriend wanted to help me relax. He flicked my bean and went on a minge binge to my little heart\\'s delight. He even drew me a nice bath complete with warm towels and bath beers. I really wanted to show him how I much I appreciated all his gestures, so I thought a great way to do that would be to let him give a facial. I start doing my duties and all is rainbows and puppies. He gives me the signal and I activate baby bird mode trying to give him the best view I can. That\\'s where the fuck up occurs. I tilted my head back slightly too far and ended up with a nostril full of semen. It took a moment for me to register what the fuck just happened, but by the time I figured it out, my other nostril gets its turn. At this point, I just sit there and take it up the nose because I\\'ll be damed if I let man gravy get on anything. I immediately go to the bathroom afterwards to evacuate my sinuses, but I didn\\'t get it all. Not long after, I feel some slither down the back of my throat like a demented slug. I still have the smell of semen in my nose. \\n\\nTldr: A dick in my mouth ended with semen in my nose.\\n\\nEdit: Holy fuck, I did not expect this to blow up like it did. Thank you to whoever gave me my first silver!\\n\\nEdit 2: Also didn\\'t expect this to get gold or platinum. Thank you all for enjoying my story enough to give me those!  \\n\\nSo first of all i’ll start off with a little context… I don’t usually do formal first dates, especially when its with somebody i barely even know. However, i’ve just come back to University for my final year of studying and i met up with my old flat mate from last year. She had already moved into her new flat and met all of her new flat mates, one of which happened to be a very attractive girl who we will call Stacey. Now my old flat mate was always trying to set me up on dates last year at University, but i always had an excuse. Now with it being a new year i thought ill have a fresh start and really knuckle down and stop going out all the time (i said exactly the same after my 1st year) and focus on my Uni work and look for a serious relationship instead of having flings. \\n\\nSo i get shown a few pictures of Stacey and my old flat mate is telling me how nice she seems and how great she is and honestly i just thought why not, i may as well, what harm could going on a date possibly bring about? So she gives me Staceys number and we start to text and chat for a couple of weeks and we seem to be getting along really well. So much so that i suggest we should go for some food one evening to meet in person and get to know one another a little better. Now bearing in mind i never ever do this, i usually just speak to girls on nights out when i\\'m filled to the brim with liquid confidence and i’m usually so drunk that my confidence is through the roof. However i feel myself really starting to like this girl, i’ve never really been one for texting but our conversation seemed to flow naturally.\\n\\nSo i meet Stacey at this very busy restaurant last week, i’m full of nerves but i’m ready for the date. We get sat down and we begin chatting away and things seem to be going really well. Im still nervous but after a few pints the nerves start to settle and i get a bit carried away telling my stories and my somewhat crude jokes. At the best of times i’m a very loud person, however, after a few beers i turn into a human fog horn and unbeknownst to me, i’m speaking at a level high enough for the whole room to hear. I know this because all of my friends love to remind me how loud i am when we’re on a night out. Now here comes the fuck up. \\n\\nSo being full of my favourite ale and with the nerves starting to settle, i’m growing louder and louder by the minute. So much so that Stacey, very politely i must say, lets me know that i need to turn the volume down just a tad (especially when telling my alcohol fuelled jokes). Now i’m not an angry person by any means, but i can’t begin to count the amount of times I\\'ve been told to quieten down when drunk, and for some reason i decided this night was the night where i’d have enough. So instead of apologising like any normal person would, drunk me decided it would be a good idea to try and turn it back on Stacey. I don’t know what come over me but the only excuse i could muster was “Well i do apologise but, you see, i volunteer working with deaf children so i’m used to having to speak really loudly, i’ve actually just come from there before our date”. \\n\\nNow if you knew me you would realise how ridiculous this sounds. Once i told my friends and my old flat mate about what i had said they were falling to the floor with laughter. So far it doesn’t seem that bad, until Stacey says something along the lines of “wow, i’m really sorry, that is great, you must know sign language then?”. Drunk me thinking i’d got one up on her proceeded to nod and claim that i do in fact know sign language, i think i even threw up a few fake hand signs which probably looked more like gang signs to cover my tracks. However, what i didn’t expect was for Stacey to have a younger deaf brother who would apparently LOVE to meet me as she’s never dated a guy before who can do sign language!\\n\\nHonestly my heart sank, she was sat across the table from me signing something to me and god knows what she was saying. I just smiled and nodded and to this day i still don’t know what she was saying but my unenthusiastic smile and nod seemed to work. I quickly moved the conversation along and got swiftly off the subject. So now Stacey thinks i know sign language and what’s even better is that she can’t wait for me to meet her younger brother who would be so excited to be able to sign with a guy she’s dating!\\n\\nIve tried Youtube videos but all i’ve managed to pick up on is being able to say vowels and ask someones name. I don’t have the balls to tell her and i really don’t know what to do. Im seeing her again next week and i know i need to tell her the truth, she seems the sort of person who would just laugh it off but she seemed so happy when i told her and she’s even suggesting we Face Time her brother when we’re next together so i can have a conversation with him. I just feel like a dick now and i don’t want to let her down or upset her younger brother, but i don’t think asking him his name over and over is going to cut it. \\n\\nTL;DR Im a loud idiot when i’ve had a drink and instead of apologising about being such on a first date with a girl, i tried to cover it up by claiming i work with deaf children and know sign language. Turned out she has a younger deaf brother who she now wants me to meet and speak to using sign language. I don’t have the first clue about how to sign and i don’t have the balls to tell her the truth because i don’t want hurt her or her brothers feelings.\\n\\nEdit\\n\\nWOW i didn’t expect this to blow up as much as it did, i’ve just woke up now and had a chance to read through all of your comments, thank you for the platinum and what not, I just want to clear up a few things i’ve read. \\n\\nthanks for all your concern regarding me possibly be a high functioning douche bag alcoholic. first of all when i say really loud, i’m not a boisterous loud, all attention to my please sort of loud, i just speak really loud when i’m drunk enough for other people to hear, it’s because i get overly excited and it was a mix of that and the nerves which made me start talking over excitedly and get carried away with the volume. \\nalso i’ve seen a few comments about the lying. i know it wasn’t right but that’s why i tried to stress i never do anything like this, me and in person first dates just don’t mix. My nerves just got the better of me and i’m an anxious person at the best of times, i knew right away that coming clean would have been the best thing to do but i’m so awkward that i just didn’t know what to say or do and i just wanted to move on the conversation as quickly as possible. I said it in the first place intending it to be a light hearted joke (clearly i’m not funny), i wasn’t actually going to roll with the lie that i work with deaf kids. However the last thing i expected was for her to come back with that and it just completely threw me off. I’m seeing her again next weekend so i’ll be sure to update you all on how this turns out, thank you for all the advice and the genuine concern a lot of you have, and especially to all of you who have helped me see the funnier side of this situation. Disclaimer: This should be, \"several years ago IFU,\" but I\\'m a reddit n00b and wanted to share one of the most awkward series of events I\\'ve ever caused.\\n\\nI had plans to meet up with some friends in Atlantic City for the weekend. I got a late start, so they were already gambling somewhere in the Taj Mahal. I had been there once before, but didn\\'t really remember the layout, except for a long escalator that led down to the casino from the lobby.\\n\\nI parked my car and walked quickly from the parking deck to the lobby. On my way to the lobby, there was a crowd of people gathered behind a security guard who was holding some caution tape across the hallway. He let a bunch of people in and, of course, I squeezed through as he was closing it off.\\n\\nThat is where things went sideways. I saw a film camera in the lobby, and thought, \"huh, they must be filming a commercial for the casino or something.. wonder if I\\'ll be in it?\" But before I could finish that thought, everyone around me in the entire lobby froze in position. A second later, someone yells, \"ACTION!\"\\n\\nI start walking alongside a person who was next to me, and ask him quietly, \"I\\'m not suposed to be here, am I?\" He immediately shook his head no.\\n\\nSo, I see the escalator to the casino about 20 feet away.. and two \\'extras\\' are about to get on it. I think to myself, \"if I can just get on that, it would be my escape from ruining whatever they\\'re doing in the lobby.\" \\n\\nI make a move, get on the escalator, and start taking a few steps down. SUCCESS! I didn\\'t screw anything up!\\n\\nAfter a few more steps, I catch up to those two people who got on the escalator before me. And they\\'re blocking the full width, and NOT WALKING! I mean, come on!\\n\\nOnly at this point, do I see the boom microphone, the camera panning down with them, and the crowd of 150 spectators at the bottom of the escalator. Then someone yells \"CUT!\", and the two people in front of me turn around. \\n\\nTurns out those two jerks blocking the escalator were Jennnifer Aniston and Gerard Butler, and I completely blew up their scene. There was nothing I could do.. I just said, \"Uh, I\\'m sorry.\" I figured there was no point in explaining my series of bad decisions. Butler laughed, and we completed the rest of the very long escalator ride in awkward silence.\\n\\nTL;DR. I somehow found myself as an unknowing extra in a movie shoot, and completely ruined the shoot by trying to escape from the situation. TL;DR at the bottom.\\n\\nNSFW\\n\\nThis is still fresh in my mind as I\\'m typing. I take some time out of my daily commute home from night shift to make a detour and spend time with my Dad (71 years young) who spends most of the week alone as my mom (62) works all day. Today was just a routine visit. My folks live in the country and don\\'t have trash pickup so I visit with Dad while driving their garbage to the dump. As we are talking I bring up a video I had seen and suggested I share it with him. He agrees and once we get back to the house he suggests I find the video while he does something else. \\n\\nCommence Fuckup. \\nMy Dad has an older model Desktop PC that is quite temperamental and only likes to use Google Chrome. I go to open a window and see that my Dad has 20+ tabs open. All of them were different profiles on FetLife. For those who don\\'t know, FetLife is like MySpace for people with fetishes (bondage, waterworks, furries, etc). I just brushed it off as my dad being a dirty old man. Unfortunately the tab I opened Chrome to was my parents profile page. I not only saw my mother in *very* revealing garments; I also saw my dad gagged and hog tied like a pig at a pork roast. So now, not only do I know my parents are pretty kinky, I also know what it looks like when my dad is getting stuffed like a Christmas turkey. \\n\\nTL;DR:\\nOpened Google Chrome to share something with my dad, only to find out he gets butt-raunched by my mother on the regular. \\n\\nEDIT:words\\n\\nEDIT2: WOW my first Gold! Thanks Stranger!!\\n\\nEDIT 3: My wife is a reddit user and knows her husband posted this from the commute detail. She didn\\'t believe me so she temporarily created a FetLife account so I could, for once, be right. Now she is very distraught and has told me she can never look at my parents the same. What do? Warning:\\nThis story is not for the those with a weak stomach for blood and other bodily fluids. \\n\\nNo throwRA cause I’m not a pussy. \\n\\nSo, now that you’re ready to be grossed out... I have a diva cup, it’s amazing, I save so much money on tampons ect. Today I woke with blood covering the insides of my thighs, annoyed, I shuffle to the bathroom. I sat there on the toilet staring longingly into the distance, having my usual 8am existential crisis. Why am I here? What is my purpose? Why do I have to shove Dracula’s shotglass up my pussy every month? Just girly things ya know. Now, I’d love to spare you these next details but unfortunately I think they are vital for this tale. My rectum suddenly decided that I needed to take the Browns to the Super Bowl. I truly did not think my vagina had the ability to launch a blood soaked lubricated diva cup out of me at the speed of light. I had forgotten to take it out before embarking on my journey. I already knew flushing my diva cup was not an option, so I had to retrieve it. I wracked my brain for a solution, the gloves! I had plastic gloves from when I dyed my hair last! I put on both gloves, just to be safe. I retched before I even dipped my hand in. Bloody poop water is not ideal conditions to go deep diving for a diva cup. I couldn’t feel it, I started panicking as the water rose around my wrist. And suddenly, I had struck gold, I found my cup. Retrieving it and placing in the sink to clean it, I threw up, twice. \\nDo not recommend 0/10\\n\\nTL;DR\\nShot my diva cup out while pooping, had to retrieve with a gloved hand and I threw up twice. Obligatory this didn\\'t happen today but when I was in the 8th Grade.\\n\\n8th Grade was about the first time I discovered what masturbating was, give or take a few years. (Whatever year they show the \"Birds and the Bees\" movie at school) Well, needless to say, I was all for it. I think I did it just about everyday after school. And I was getting pretty good at it let me tell ya.\\n\\nOne day in particular though, I wanted to see how fast I could do the deed. So after school I ran off the bus and went straight to the bathroom and pulled out my....stopwatch. I counted down from three and went full speed. Let\\'s just say I was a little too rough with my ding\\\\-ding.\\n\\nAfter I beat my record time, there was this strange tightness in my nether realm that was different from all the other times I had \"spatooshed\". I just assumed I over\\\\-heated the poor thing and needed to let it rest so I laid down on my bed to take a nap. The tightness never went away so I had a hard time falling asleep. The tightness moved up and started to turn into a stomach ache, then a nauseous feeling, then a constant pain that felt like a burning cramp in my lower stomach area.\\n\\nI was groaning in pain and trying to not to cry when my parents came in my room asking what was wrong. I told them that my stomach hurt really really bad. (I failed to mention that my Dangly Bits hurt a little bit too) So my Dad, being the classic Mexican dad that he is, just said \"Just drink this 7up and take some Tums and you\\'ll be fine in no time.\" Unsurprisingly, that did not fix my pain at all. 10 mins go by and my mom looks at me tossing and turning and says \"Thats it, I can\\'t take it anymore. We\\'re going to the hospital.\"\\n\\nOh. My. Lanta. Talk about the worst 30 min car ride of my life. Every bump sent a new sharp pain through my body.  I thought I was going to pass out from the pain. This was my new worst pain of my life.\\n\\nWe eventually get to the hospital and get in to see a doctor. I tell him that there are sharp pains in my stomach that won\\'t go away. I didn\\'t tell them about my downstairs hurting too because, well, 8th Grade me was too embarrassed and didn\\'t want people looking at my dingle\\\\-dangle. So they run every stomach test in the book and wouldn\\'t you know it, they don\\'t find anything. At this point it\\'s been 2\\\\-3 hours since I got there so I say screw it and I finally muster up the courage to whisper to me mum \"Hey Mom, my uhh....balls hurt too kinda.\" Right away she yells WHY DIDN\\'T YOU SAY SOMETHING?! Then she calls a nurse to take a look.\\n\\nThe nurse lady comes in and says that it might be testicular torsion then proceeds to put on gloves, tells me to hold on tight, then MANHANDLES MY BEANBAGS! For those who don\\'t know, testicular torsion is when one of your nuts literally turns around in your sack and is backwards. So this lady is trying to turn it back around with her hands! I SCREAM in pain. Now, I would never hit a woman in my life but I would be lying if told you I didn\\'t raise my hand and was about to slap that bitch. Haha. Remember when I said the car ride was the worst pain of my life? Well this one was my new new worst pain of my life. Anyway, my right nut ended up winning the wrestling match so they prep me to surgically turn it back that way it was.\\n\\nThe surgery was quick and I didn\\'t have a lot of pain afterwards. They went in there, twisted it back, and wired it in place so it doesn\\'t turn again. I just had to wear a jock strap stuffed with gauze for about 3 days then I was back to \"normal\". Well, because Righty decided to take a left turn at Albuquerque, the veins that were connected to him got twisted. Thus stopping any blood flow that was trying to reach him. This means Righty shrunk. Like a lot. Lets just say Lefty towers over the little guy now. Could be worst though. The doctor said 30 more minutes and I would\\'ve lost him.\\n\\nI ended up making the mistake of telling my friends about the shrinkage which resulted in some nice nicknames for my twins. Rob and Big, Dr. Evil and Mini Me, Pinky and the Brain are some of my favorites. Lol.\\n\\nLesson to be learned here: Some things are meant to be taken slow.\\n\\nTL;DR  Wanted to masturbate really fast, twisted a nut, got surgery, now have 1.5 sperm balloons.\\n\\nEDIT: Thank you for the Gold kind stranger! Glad my story could make your day. :) This is long and will have a tldr at the bottom.\\n\\nSaturday night my gf and i had my parents over for a  game night. We just moved into our new place last week Monday and wanted them to see it. We were waiting on my brother who was running late so i decided to have a smoke on my balcony. \\n\\nEverything is normal for the first few minutes. I’m just playing some “free” game I’ve spent way too much money on and not aware at all of my surrounding. Then it happened. A bug flew in my ear. Now this happens occasionally. A bug will fly and hit my ear and be on its way, but this little bastard decided my ear was going to be its new home and dug deep.\\n\\nI immediately lost all semblance of self control and flung my phone and the chair i was sitting on and sprinted into the apartment while freaking out. The bug was digging or chewing and vibrating and that sound and feeling against your ear drum has to be the worst thing you can ever experience. My gf freezes, my father tells me to get in the shower and just fill my ear with water. I’m helpless at this point so i just follow my dads instructions. \\n\\nThe bug did not like the water. It dug deeper. The noise and feeling got worse. I used a qtip to try to dig it out. All i got was blood. My father took a used water bottle from my recycling, poked a hole in the cap and used that to try to directly flush the bug. Nothing but more digging and moving. I am literally screaming everytime it moves. Both from the pain and the disgusting feeling i got when i felt it. \\n\\nMy mother at this points takes off to run to a store to grab something she thinks will help. I barely notice she leaves but i hope to god she will save me. In the mean time, my gf reads that a couple of drops of vegetable oil can suffocate the bug. So my dad opens our brand new bottle of oil and dumps it in my ear.   At this point my entire body is covered in oil. I could have used concrete as a slip in slide. I’m naked in my shower with a bug in my ear, topped of with oil, holding the shower curtain over my crotch trying to keep some bit of modesty all why freaking out at the chewing next to my brain. \\n\\nThe oil does nothing but piss it off. We are talking about going to the hospital when my mother returns. She has what looks like the top of a turkey baster. Apparently this is something used to suck out booger’s from babies noses. My father tries to use it at first because my limbs no longer work. He doesn’t go deep enough because he doesn’t want to pop my ear drum. I didn’t care at that point because the bug was using it as an actual drum already so i managed to regain use of my arm, grabbed the thing and jammed it in my ear. It sucks the bug but it’s too big to get it out. Too heavy for it to hold onto. \\n\\nMy gf then fills it with water and suggests i use that to flush the bug. After 4 attempts, i finally feel some relief. I look down on my chest and see something far bigger than i expected. At this point I’m too freaked out to look closely and yell for her to look. She freaks because it’s a moth. A good size moth. I again nearly shit myself and rinse it off. \\n\\nI can not do justice to this event in words. I can not accurately describe the noise, the feeling, the horror of this. Picture it yourselves. Imagine you have a dime sized bug in your ear scratching, biting, chewing, digging. Then realize it actually feels worse than that. \\n\\nIf this was punishment for committing crimes, we would no longer need jails. 1 day with a bug in your ear would be enough punishment for murder and i can promise you they wouldn’t do it again. \\n\\nI’d rather be waterboarded while listening to Barney on a loop. Those terrorists had it easy. \\n\\nI now wear my girlfriends bright pink beats headphones out while smoking and am strongly considering quitting. It shook me that much. \\n\\nTLDR: a bug flew in my ear while i was smoking. Stayed in there for half an hour while i tried everything conceivable to get it out. I finally did. It was more horrific than you can imagine.\\n\\nEdit: I’ve tried to keep up with the comments so I’ll answer some of them here.\\n\\nI’m still flushing my ear regularly with peroxide. This morning i still found what i think is moth wing residue. I’ve made an appointment with my primary doctor for 130 this afternoon (eastern time zone US). I’ll keep you posted on the egg situation haha. \\n\\nI’m now smoking a lot less and mostly when I’m driving . I feel like god would be after me if a bug managed to find its way in my ear driving down the road with the window down only a few inches. \\n\\nI didn’t expect this to blow up but to everyone commenting saying it happened to them, I’m sorry. I feel your pain. \\n\\nTo those saying moths don’t bite, I’m not exactly a bug expert. All i know is the feeling, the sound, the blood, it was doing something in there that id really rather never experience again. It’s truly an indescribable feeling and one i hope you never have to experience. This happened in 2007 but I have flashbacks at every airport.\\n\\nI was living in Canada and my very frugal Polish girlfriend would complain about how expensive non-applicator tampons are. For men (like me) who didn\\'t or don\\'t know this, there are apparently two types of tampon; one that looks like a little spaceship that helps you launch the tampon up your vajayjay, and the other that resembles a cotton torpedo that you stuff up there without any plasticky assistance. She was very frustrated that, for a bit of tightly wound cotton, you had to pay so much to plug up the ol\\' punani.\\n\\nFortunately for her, I was going to Europe, where tampons were (and perhaps still are?) much cheaper. Specifically, I was going to Poland, where non-applicator tampons could be bought individually wrapped and in ginormous plastic bags for a handful of złoty. Always looking to save a loonie, my girlfriend insisted that she place an order with me for as many tampons as I could fit into a suitcase. Ever the loving boyfriend, I obliged.\\n\\nFor those wondering how many tampons can be tightly stuffed into a suitcase, it\\'s about five thousand.\\n\\nLittle did I know of the carnage I\\'d face upon landing. As I approached baggage claim, I heard a mixture of confused mumbling and embarrassed laughter from around the carousel. From a distance, it looked like polystyrene packing pellets had come out of some unfortunate passenger\\'s bag. It took a few moments for me to realise that those pellets were in fact my tampons. All 5,000 of my tampons.\\n\\nA strap on my soft-sided bag had got caught on the baggage delivery mechanism, and the bag was old and ragged enough that it tore open like a paper bag. My life flashed before my eyes. My instincts kicked in. And then, like the cheapest, thriftiest, most penny-pinching Pole, I launched myself upon the carousel and started grabbing up tampons.\\n\\nI think I must have stuffed a few hundred in my jacket pockets and down the front of my shirt before I even realised what I was doing. Needless to say, I\\'d garnered quite an audience, and nobody looked... amused. In fact, they all looked a bit alarmed that a scruffy, bearded man was snatching up tampons with no snatch on a wife or teenage daughter to be seen.\\n\\nBizarrely, I decided at this point that I could probably still get away with pretending it wasn\\'t my bag to begin with, so I quietly skulked away with my other suitcase and headed through immigration. Which, in retrospect, must have made me look like an opportunistic tampon thief.\\n\\nInitially, my girlfriend saw the funny side, until her grandmother -- good ol\\' Babcia, God rest her soul --  insisted I was an abusive partner for having failed to collect them all. I failed her, apparently, and my lack of dedication to my woman reflected poorly on my already wavering image of manhood. Babcia drove me back to the airport and insisted I fess up and try to collect the rest.\\n\\nWhich is when I learned that the baggage staff had collected them up, and a bunch of employees had divvied them up to take home. So if you work at YVR and are still plugging up at the expense of my shame, you\\'re welcome. My cheeks are as red as your tampons.\\n\\n**TL;DR:** Brought 5,000 tampons from Poland to Vancouver; bag burst open on the baggage carousel and I snatched up many of those tampies like a champ.\\n\\n**Edit:** Thanks so much for the awards and karma! No, we\\'re not still together. Realised I was gay about a year later; can\\'t help but think this had something to do with it.\\n\\nI also wanted to address the NSFW tag, which I added, not the Reddit mods. I did the \"would my own boss approve of seeing this on my screen?\" litmus test. I decided she\\'d have no issue with vaginas, menstruation and tampons -- as nobody should! -- but she certainly wouldn\\'t approve of my writing style. In case yours doesn\\'t either, it\\'s NSFW! Last night I was in the shower shaving as usual and I decided to try coconut oil as a moisturizer after shaving my bikini line. My skin is extremely sensitive and shaving it makes it worse so I\\'m constantly trying new ways to stop the irritation. I had the great idea of trying out coconut oil as a moisturizer. I had bought some that day and it seemed to work fine. I leave the shower and go to bed with my husband.\\n\\nAs we lay in bed one thing leads to another and we end up having sex. Everything is great and I feel nice and moisturized untill my husband starts complaining about his penis burning. He starts freaking out and the skin on his penis got bright red. He freaks out and goes to the shower to rinse it with cold water. The pain just got worse for him and I quickly drove him to the hospital. He was practically crying in pain. He had developed small red blisters all over his penis and the skin around it. We were both freaking out and I explained to the doctors everything that had happened.\\n\\nWell it turns out my husband is allergic to coconuts and had a severe skin reaction to the coconut oil I used. He is now in bed resting with a sore penis and a severe coconut phobia. So if anyone has any tips for a new moisturizer let me know.\\n\\nTL;DR I used coconu oil as a moisturizer before having sex with my husband. He had a severe skin reaction to it and developed burning blisters on his penis.\\n\\nEdit: Wow this is crazy thank you for all the awards! especially the golden coconuts, very fitting. I\\'m glad my husbands suffering has brought you joy, he is having a great time reading all the comments. And thank you for all the advice, all your tips are appreciated! This happened about a couple hours ago and I still want to shrivel up into nothing. So today was a new co-worker\\'s first day on the job, hopefully not her last. My job is primarily male dominated with only a couple female employees and one female manager. Obviously it\\'s nothing against women, it\\'s just not often that we get female applications due to the physical labor we do on the daily. Plus it\\'s pretty much in the middle of nothing, so not many people just stumble upon our workplace unless you already know it\\'s there. \\n\\nI\\'m usually the trainer for all new employees since I\\'ve been with the company and travelled to other locations to train new hires. I\\'ve spent all day with my new co-worker, showing her the ropes and just getting to know each other. All is going well and we already started to break the awkward ice/first day jitters. \\n\\nMy male coworkers and managers are very loose and carefree around each other. We joke around and talk about pretty much anything with each other. One of my coworkers, let\\'s call him Jack, and I have this run on joke between each other where we say, \"Hey check out this meme,\" and it\\'s just an \"avant garde\" porn gif or something vulgar like granny titties off of a subreddit. I had just pulled this stupid joke with Jack, had a good laugh, and proceeded with my training.\\n\\nThe new hire and I start talking about what we watch on Netflix, hobbies, and social media. I tell her that I don\\'t have any social media, just a reddit account. She\\'s never heard of Reddit and I didn\\'t know how to explain it to her. So I decided to just show her what Reddit is. She\\'s literally right next to me as I open up the app, and to both of our shock the gif of the old lady getting absolutely railed was still opened. I immediately close the app, apologising profusely, and stumbling over my words trying to explain myself. She just says, \"It\\'s fine,\" and walks away to probably second guess her new job or tell her friend who got her the job about what just happened. I hope she believes my excuse and that I\\'m not into GILFs. More importantly her mindset on the workplace. \\n\\nThis will be the last time I pull that joke with Jack. At the end of our shift, she thanked me for training her and that she\\'ll check out Reddit when she gets home. I still want to call off tomorrow since I\\'ll still continue training her tomorrow as well. (I told her that I\\'ll be posting this incident on r/TIFU, so if you\\'re reading this Daniela again I\\'m so sorry, it won\\'t happen again)\\n\\nTL;DR. Tried to show a new hire what Reddit was and instead showed her someone\\'s grandma getting railed into oblivion. \\n\\nEdit 1: She made a reddit account, asked for help on operating the app, and I brought up the incident again to apologise once more. She said she thought it was funny and that she was not offended. We\\'re getting drinks with a mutual friend tomorrow as well. HOWEVER!!!! I still learned a valuable lesson about professionalism in the workplace. I also learned that this type of behavior happens a LOT on purpose, my accident made me realize that there are men that act like this on purpose on the daily and it\\'s not okay at all for women to have to endure or relocate due to zero consequences of some douchebag that thinks men are superior to women. Furthermore I learned that there\\'s a lot to accomplish in the safety and comfortability in the workplace for women, people of colour, and members of the LGBTQ community. I\\'m not Scott free from this incident as it will stay with me for all my years in my career to come and uphold the responsibility to make all people love coming to work and not dread/fear it. PLEASE don\\'t just upvote this post for a laugh at my stupidity, but bringing attention to this type of behavior and how it can make someone question their workplace. Sexual harassment is not okay. Discouraging others is not okay. It will not be tolerated, and it must not go unspoken. \\n\\nEdit 2: Calling me a simp, a faggot, or a libtard clearly shows that some people don\\'t understand the severity of sexual harassment and y\\'all are part of the problem, not the solution. Yeah I just wanted to give you all just a good laugh at my stupidity, but hearing personal stories from actual victims in the comments and messages made clear to me that my actions can hold a lot of weight on someone. I just don\\'t want to be the reason someone quits or doesn\\'t want to come into work. YOU just might be someone\\'s reason. Peace! This just happened.\\n\\nTo begin, I recently graduated from college and my lease ended. I planned on moving in with my girlfriend, but due to COVID she moved out of her place and into her mom\\'s. Therefore, I have temporarily moved into her mom\\'s as well until I find a job.\\n\\nSo last night we finished unpacking and after her family fell asleep we decided to have sex. After some fun, we both felt sweaty and hot in her stuffy room so I opened her bedroom door to let the room cool down.\\n\\nMy girlfriend then told me to watch out for her mom\\'s cat because when she used to live here it would always get into the trash in her room, and to not leave the door open if I\\'m not in it.\\n\\nFast forwarding to today, I picked up some herb from the dispensary and packed a bowl. Since we don\\'t smoke inside I grabbed my bubbler, grinder and such leaving my hands full and headed to the back porch for a sesh. Because my hands were full I forgot to shut the bedroom door.\\n\\nThis is where the fucked up part begins. Her family knows and doesn\\'t care that I smoke. I have my medical card so I smoked even though her mom, dad, older sister and mom\\'s neighbor friend were watching TV together in the living room with doors to the back porch.\\n\\nI get to the end of my session and I\\'m rather baked, and while writing this I\\'m still pretty stoned and cringing from all of this embarrassment. But anyway, due to the fact that I got more intoxicated than I anticipated I wanted to sneak off from her family and chill alone for a while to sober up, and play some Luigi\\'s Mansion in the room while my girlfriend napped.\\n\\nWell that didn\\'t happen. I open the screen door and as I walk in her family looks at me and I anxiously ask, \"Watcha guys watching?\" even though I asked that on the way out. Her mom chuckled and reminded me that they\\'re still watching Tudors and then stopped speaking mid-sentence.\\n\\nShe gasped and looked at the floor causing the rest of the group to shift their attention from the TV.\\n\"Ummmm... Professoroac... I think the cat has something of yours....\"\\n\\nI look at the look of horror on the neighbor\\'s face, the disgust from her sister and honestly a disturbing lack of expression from her dad and then look to the cat.\\n\\nThe cat has a used condom in her mouth from the trash in our room. My hands are full, I\\'m stoned in a room full of my sleeping girlfriend\\'s family and my cum is dripping from their cat\\'s mouth onto the hardwood floors.\\n\\nI drop everything in my hands on the kitchen counter. I went for the cat who then began running around the living room spilling my seed now on the rug. Her neighbor friend jumps up on the couch and starts screeching and yelling \"ew\". Her mom can\\'t stop laughing at this point.\\n\\nI finally grab the cat and take the condom from its mouth. I felt like I sprinted across the room. Threw it in the main garbage and grabbed papertowels for the baby trail left behind.\\n\\nWhile wiping up my mess no one says anything but I can feel their gazes burning into the back of my head. I threw it away and then ran into the bathroom to clean up.\\n\\nNow I\\'m still in the bathroom too high and anxious to face everyone again. My girlfriend won\\'t answer my texts so I assume she is still in her room sleeping. I hear the TV is turned back on so maybe I can slip by them.\\n\\nMy thoughts are racing but I plan on trying to get back into our room without talking about what happened until another time. If someone says something I\\'ll probably just make a joke or something and nope out of the room.\\n\\nTL;DR Went outside to smoke some weed. Came back inside to greet my girlfriend\\'s family only to have her cat enter the room with a recently used condom of mine. An awkward chase ensued and now I\\'m cringing in the bathroom stoned as shit.\\n\\nEdit: Many people have preferred leaving the post with an open ending so the update has been moved to a TIFUpdate post with proof [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/i14yw5/tifupdate_to_tifu_by_leaving_the_bedroom_door_open/). **EDIT:** So seems like a large majority of the people here have decided to tell me that I do not know my own sexuality preference and have determined to tell **ME** who and what I am attracted to. Well sorry, I am not gay and I am not bisexual. I have a one time ‘gay’ experience and truthfully I regret it. I am not not have I ever been attracted to men in any shape or form. I’m 25 years old and extremely secure with my sexuality and this is not something I’d ever seek out again or repeat. Just something I randomly decided to do while I was drunk and horny. I’ve been drunk thousands of times before and also horny and never done something similar to this. \\n\\nSo once again please do not tell me what my sexuality is. It’s pretty ridiculous. \\n\\n———————————————————————————\\n\\nThis happened about 6 months ago but I ended up having to work with him again recently and the awkwardness came back fully. \\n\\nWell the story goes about 6 months ago I was in Florida on a work trip. My buddies and I went out and got drinks and got super fucked up and made it back to the hotel around 2am or so. I’m not sure what compelled me to do so. Maybe being drunk made me super horny and I wasn’t quite sure what to do about it but I ended up downloading the app Grindr. If you’re not sure what it is, it’s basically a gay hookup app... I’ve never done anything like this before but I guess I decided to say fuck it, I want a blowjob. So I made an account, signed in, and immediately got a few messages. Well Grindr has a distance reading and one of the guys that messaged me was 60’ away from me. So I was kinda interested since he was just a few rooms away. He offered to let me come by and he’d turn on some porn for me as long as he could give me a blowjob. Told me he doesn’t do this very often but being away from his wife he likes to explore a bit. Well, I decided to just say fuck it and told him sure I’d be over there in a bit. Stumbled over to his room and the lights were kinda dim which made it slightly easier but he sat me down and gave me head. I finished, he swallowed, shook me hand and I went back to my room and passed out. \\n\\nTwo days later we’re told to report to work end I show up with my friends and there’s a group of men in a circle talking and we approach them and sure enough I recognized the main boss man. He just looks at me and I look at him and we just awkwardly shake hands again and he lays out the plan for today’s work. I don’t think any of us expected to know each other let alone work together for the next few weeks and it was a super awkward three weeks of working together... Definitely a secret I’m taking to the grave with me. Well besides with you guys lol\\n\\nTl;dr: I got drunk in Florida and ended up downloading Grindr and meeting up with a stranger for a blowjob. Turns out he was going to be my married boss for the next three weeks. The class was supposed to start at 10am and due to my new fucked up sleep schedule during the quarantine, waking up at 10am is next to impossible.\\n\\nYet I did, with the help of a few alarms. The aim was to join the class and then go back to sleep.\\n\\nYou have probably guessed what happened next.\\n\\nHaving just woken up and still groggy af, I somehow joined the class and fell back asleep without muting myself or turning off the camera.\\n\\nEveryone including my professor saw me sleep and snore during the entire class, all their attempt to wake me up were in vain and then they finally decided to continue the class while I snored. \\n\\nI woke up to a mail from my professor to remember to turn off the camera and microphone from the next class.\\n\\nI don\\'t think I will ever show anyone my face ever again.\\n\\nTL;DR: Forgot to turn off my camera and microphone and the entire class watched me snore. TIFU by going into a store with my face covered with this respirator mask with my hoodie on, mind you that im a 6\\'1 Native guy with tatoos (every other canaidian thinks we are all criminals) while im checking out i pay with cash I then stupidly say put the money in the bag (as in my change from the 50$ bill I used because i dont want to touch the dirty money unless I wipe it down first with disinfectant hence COVID-19!) The lady freaks out and runs away from the register crying then the manager comes I try to explain through my heavy respirator while sounding like darth vader what happend she gives me my change back along with a dirty look I then awkwardly walk out of store with my head down in shame, im never going back to that store again. It all happened this morning.\\n\\nI´m a student  in Cologne, Germany. My parents visited me over the weekend and stayed in my own flat. Yesterday evening we went out to get some drinks and celebrate my successful second semester. My dad and me were pretty drunk, so we went home and fell into bed. Next morning my lovely mom made some breakfast for us, while we were still asleep. She woke us up with some coffee so we sat down in the kitchen. I couldn\\'t eat anything cause my hangover was pretty bad. So my mom and dad started eating some scrambled eggs and some Wurstbrot (sausage sandwich). After a few minutes I started eating too. I took my first bite of the bread and recognized/tasted  what just happened. I had made some weed butter with some friends a while ago to bake some cookies. We made way to much of it so I kept the rest inside a plastic box in my fridge. Yeah.. so I took my first bite and realised that my mom took this butter to cook the scrambled eggs and even used it for the Wurstbrot. I was shocked and felt like frozen. I didn\\'t know how to explain or even what to do from there on. My mom noticed my reaction and asked if everything is all right. I asked her which butter she used and she told me that she used the one which was already opened in the box. So I started carefully to explain what just happened before the weed may kick in without them knowing what is going on. My mom started to panic, cause she never done drugs and has completely no relationship to weed. For her its a real, hard drug.My dads reaction was pretty chill. He started laughing and tried to calm down my mom, cause he was smoking pot in his youth too. An hour later after my dad could relax my mom a bit, she felt asleep while my dad got pretty high. He started talking a lot about his time as a teenager and told me stories about some of his trips in and to Amsterdam. I am pretty glad my dad reacted that cool! Cause my mom isn\\'t fine with it at all.As soon as my mom woke up the drama began again. She is still pretty angry at me and is disappointed cause she thought I would never do drugs. My dad told me she would calm down soon. They drove home a few hours ago.I think I never felt that weird and kind of helpless as today. Its hard to describe how it felt... awkward for sure!\\n\\nTLDR: My mom took my weed butter without knowing and made breakfast with it. My dad got high while my mom was groundbreaking disappointed and fell asleep.\\n\\nEDIT: So my mom called me today. She apologised that she seemed so disappointed she was only afraid of it. She told me that she never came in contact with weed even in her youth. She has absolutely no relationship to it. She said that she is proud of me and that I should be carefully with smoking weed.   \\nThanks for all the likes, comments and awards! Didn\\'t expect that to happen. I try to call my dad later and ask him if he is still into smoking weed. Obligatory, this didn\\'t happen today, rather three days ago.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve been single now for three years and haven\\'t knocked boots with anyone in at least 2 so, finally fed up with celibacy and buffered by my friends success story, I joined a dating site.  \\n\\n\\nI started talking to this pretty good looking guy. He was a little boring, we didn\\'t have much in common but i figured meh, may as well meet up for a drink and so we did on Thursday evening. He looked exactly as he did on his profile (6\"8\\' power lifter who looked like a legit Viking) so there was an overwhelming feeling of relief that I hadn\\'t been catfiished but I was pretty sure I didn’t want to see him again after about half an hour of chatting. That said, he didn’t seem like a murderer and there was a stirring in my loins, so I invited him back to mine. \\n\\n\\nIt started well and I was like fuck YES, let’s do this! So I said as much. I also said you’re not going to call me back if we do this are you? He said he would. He’s a liar. So bullet dodged. \\n\\n\\nAnyway, he proceeds to pick me up like I weighed literally nothing which was exciting tbh because no one else has ever been capable of such a feat (I\\'m pretty large) and carries me to the bedroom. I’m like STRIP because I’ve gone rabid by this point from the carrying and the dominance. At this juncture, I realise that this guy is completely in proportion if you catch my drift but I figure babies come out of there so I\\'m grand.\\n\\n\\n\\nThere’s a warm up wristy and a little Spiderman and then we get down to bi\\'ness. It’s over pretty fucking fast, like under a minute, so I open my eyes trying desperately not to look disappointed and he’s just kneeling there with that soooorrrryyy look on his face. \\n\\n\\nSo I’m trying my best to reassure him that 12 seconds is totally enough then he looks down and his face goes pale and he asks have I got a tissue? My first reaction is shit, the condom broke but nah, it was much worse. \\n\\n\\nBlood.jpeg\\n\\n\\nSo much fucking blood. Well, I know it’s not a wild period since I’m not afflicted with that shit. I RUN to the bathroom (cream carpets) and holy fucking shit. I’m like get me a bandage or a nappy or some shit. Meanwhile I’ve never seen someone get dressed faster in my life. \\n\\n\\nWe have a hasty conversation about the first inane bullshit subject that comes to mind and he leaves. I clean up the crime scene which is my bed and go to sleep thinking no more of it. Like it’ll stop. \\n\\n\\nNope. Next day is agony and still going. Trying not to do that thing at work where you have to lower yourself into your seat super carefully since a few people know I went on a date and I don’t want them thinking I’m some harlot. I\\'m still optimistic at this point that it\\'ll stop.\\n\\n\\nWake up Saturday, bleeding is worse than ever. But like fresh, bullet wound type blood. And I felt so sick and dizzy. I\\'m freaking the fuck out. Obviously can’t tell my Mum because catholic shame so I go to the out of hours doctor by myself on the advice of the 111 lady (who I think thought I had been raped because I was crying so much because I’ve broken my vagina) and just sit in the waiting room, silently crying whenever I think for too long about how this is probably the last time I’ll ever have sex and it wasn’t even that good. Mercifully, my buddy came to keep me company because she’s wonderful.\\n\\n\\nGet in to see the doctor. After a very sweet but obviously terrified middle aged Asian man and 2 nurse practitioners having a good old look, it\\'s determined that I have a pretty substantial tear/graze which is going though a small blood vessel and because it\\'s on a particularly mobile area of my lady garden, its unlikely to heal without a little help. Brilliant.\\n\\nTheres surgical glue on my vagina. I\\'m never dating again.\\n\\ntl;dr: Had sex with a giant Viking power lifter, ended up getting my vagina skin glued back together.\\n\\nEDIT: First, wow. I didn\\'t expect this to blow up like this. Thanks for reading and thanks for the gold to those who gave it.\\n\\nSecond. To clarify, a Spider-man as I meant it is also known as the finger trick (middle and ring fingers in, the rest out, pull up repeatedly) although the PLAH!! Spider-man version is also great! Hope that helps.\\n\\n So this happened about 6 years ago, but a little piece of me died that day and I cringe everytime I think about it so here it goes:\\n\\nSo I (27M) work construction. I\\'m comfortable with my sexuality but the trade is inherently very macho and homophobic.(important later) So anyways, I had been looking for work for about half a year and finally landed a job with a local contractor. We seemed to get along fairly well so I was looking forward to working for him. \\n\\nWell, me being fresh out of trade school, I was naive and had a toolbox chock full of \"gimmicky\" tools and apparatus that were supposed to make my life easier but any veteran tradesmen would know is absolutely useless crap. One such example, my toolbelt had \"new and improved!\" hammer loops, which was a partial loop with two little spring loaded arms (they looked like pinball paddles) so you could just slap the hammer into the loop instead of sliding it in from the top. Sooo amazing...\\n\\nI show up for my first day decked out in my future-age carpentry gadgets and about 20 pounds of clothes because it was the dead of winter. After exchanging pleasantries with my new crew, I was shown where I\\'d be working: 30 feet up on a narrow scaffold plank with my new boss. No biggie.\\n\\nSo him and I scale the scaffold and begin working. At some point, my boss needs to get on the other side of me, so I scoot to the edge of the plank and he starts sliding behind me...\\n\\n*CLICK*\\n\\nThe front of his belt promptly gets lodged into my fuckin hammer holder. Like I said, we were wearing lots of clothes so it took a minute to see why we were stuck ass-to-balls, and we embarrassingly chuckled before trying to free ourselves. My hammer was in the loop already, so with his part of the belt in there as well, there wasnt enough room for the little arms to fold back and release me from my nightmare.\\n\\n For about fifteen minutes we shared that intimate moment on that scaffold, before another coworker came around the corner. After asking what the fuck we were doing, he proceeded to take a wedding\\'s worth of pictures of us while laughing hysterically. I had had enough. I took my pliers and ripped off the arms on the hammer holder. Free at last, we worked the rest of the day in silence.\\n\\nI promptly went home and threw my belt into my wood boiler. If you ever want to break the ice with a new employer, just force them to spoon you on your first day.\\n\\nTL;DR my boss and I got stuck together ass-to-balls on my first day working because of my stupid belt\\n\\nEdit: it was extremely cold out and the suspenders attached to my belt were under about 3 layers of clothes. The only way to take my belt off was to undress, attached to my boss, on top of a 30\\' scaffold. Not happening. It may not have been 15 minutes, I didn\\'t get out my stopwatch, but it sure as hell felt longer than that.\\n\\nEdit#2: The coworker taking the pics was my boss\\'s stepson, so I\\'m not about to message him and ask \"hey remember 6 years ago when you caught me and your Pa spooning? Mind sending me the pics?\" Sorry to disappoint:( Okay, so this didn’t happen today, but 3 days ago. I’ve been laid up in a hospital bed since then, so give me a break and just read the damn thing. \\n\\nWednesday night the BF and I were kid free for the evening and decided to go out on a quick date. Ended up having a blast at our local joint, then came home and did the deed. Wanting to spice things up a bit, we tried a new position. Don’t get too excited, it wasn’t anything acrobatic, just different for *us*.  I jokingly said afterward that I needed some Advil after cause I doubted I could walk afterwards. \\n\\n*ha ha ha*\\n\\nI would live to regret that joke. \\n\\nMy pelvic area began to ache about 10 minutes afterwards. I said to him “I’ll be right back, I guess I really do need an Advil” and went downstairs. My pelvis began to hurt so I stopped  in the bathroom and immediately collapsed. The pain was surreal. My body began to shake. I started to sweat. I had my phone with me and frantically tried to dial my BF cause I couldn’t muster up the breath to scream for him. My fingers fumbled about, I couldn’t get my phone to work. I was losing consciousness. A few seconds later my BF comes downstairs to get something to drink and finds me on the bathroom floor. \\n\\nNext thing you know I’m at the emergency room. 12 hours I was in the ER unable to move due to the extreme pain. I cried out and my vitals were crashing, I looked 3 months pregnant, my stomach was swelling. \\n\\nThankfully a nurse named Hannah stopped by and recognized my symptoms just as my stomach went rigid and my vitals tanked. I was rushed to the OR. \\n\\n2 hours later I’m being awoken by a nurse and told that I had what was called a Hemorrhagic Cyst of about 6cm that had ruptured as a result of our sexual endeavor and was bleeding out into my abdomen at an alarming rate. How alarming? 2.5 liters of blood was removed during surgery from my abdomen. That’s how much. I required a blood transfusion. \\n\\nRecovery will be long. My body is totally wiped. But at least I can say the sex was good. \\n\\nTLDR; Had sex and ended up almost dying due to internal bleeding from a ruptured cyst. Better now.\\n\\nEDIT:: Apparently the position is called “The Mating Press”. \\n\\nAnd for the assholes who keep messaging me that I’m a damn liar, here’s some photos from the [ER VISIT](https://imgur.com/a/YmkQa5l). Do you want my discharge papers too? Jesus. As it’s often the case, this didn’t happen today, but a few years ago when I was maybe 15yo, young and naive.\\n\\nMy mom’s best friend back then was V, a young woman in her late-30s, the widow of a really great man that had died a few years earlier, too young, because of a disease.\\n\\nV is a bright, intelligent, well-mannered and good-looking woman. After losing her husband and mourning his death for a long time, she started dating again. She brought to our home a few men over the years.\\n\\nOne of those times, V had invited over for dinner a man (let’s call him A) who she introduced to us as a “good friend”. A was a middle-aged man originally from Bosnia. He now lived in my hometown and run his construction business.\\n\\nFor those of you not fully aware of Bosnia and the things that happened there, brief history lesson. It’s a small country in the Balkans (Eastern Europe, north of Greece), and it used to be part of the former Yugoslavia. Long story short, in the 1990s a civil war broke out there, and things got really, really ugly, many were murdered, and many fled, including A.\\n\\nThat evening, at dinner we were all trying to get to know A better. He seemed a nice, soft-spoken man, mature, and with a lot of experience on his shoulders. We start asking him questions about how long he’s been out of Bosnia, etc.\\n\\nI start to think of something witty to say to “vet” him. Something funny.\\n\\nI asked him if he’d ever killed someone, jokingly.\\n\\nHe looked at me, all serious. He said yes. Everyone became silent.\\n\\nHe went on to explaining that during the war he had to make some difficult actions a couple of times. They were those situations where it was either his life (and the lives of his beloved ones), or the other person’s. He wasn’t a soldier, but just a regular civilian looking out for himself.\\n\\nI felt horrible for asking this. When I thought I was just making a joke, I opened up some really painful memories. Things that were not easy for him. Still today, many years later, i can’t imagine how he must feel living with such memories. And it was also the first time young me started to realize what war actually is, how it impacts real people around us.\\n\\nAfter a short moment in which everyone was trying to cope with strong emotions, the dinner slowly went back to normal. We never spoke about that again.\\n\\n—\\n\\nTL;DR: I thought I’d make a funny joke and ask my friends’ date at dinner if he’d ever killed anyone. Turns out, he did during the civil war in former Yugoslavia, to save his and his loved ones lives. The joke became immediately too serious and thinking about it still makes me uncomfortable to this day. Edit: I’m not sure many of you are aware, but y’all are on a sub called *Today I Fucked Up*, yet feel like you’re actually contributing to social injustice by going berserk on me in the comments. It’s quite funny. Go do something productive and donate to BLM organizations or post bail for a protester. Don’t be a keyboard warrior\\n\\n\\n\\nThis happened earlier this evening. So it’s my day off and I decided to take the day to pamper myself and this routine includes doing a charcoal face mask. This mask is, obviously, black. Masks are so normal that I have never once considered that it may look wrong on anyone’s face, hence why I’m a dumbass and didn’t think twice about leaving the house with it on. \\n\\nI also never care much about what I look like. So when it was near time for my boyfriend to come home, right after applying my mask, I went to make dinner but felt really lazy and decided I was going to go through a drive thru instead. I honestly forgot for a split second I even had a mask on my face. \\n\\nSo I get there, order, and pull up to the window. The woman is an older (white) lady and she looks at me very weirdly, with a look of horror on her face. She doesn’t say anything. I think, “why is she looking at me that way?” and hand her my card. I ask how she’s doing and she doesn’t say anything as she takes my card and shuts the window. I’m like huh, okay. It dawns on me as I sit there that she’s probably totally judging me for wearing a face mask out like a complete slob, and I chuckle about it. Then she comes back. \\n\\nShe’s mad this time. She hands me my card back and goes “actually, we’re not going to be serving you. We have a zero tolerance policy for behavior like this and I’m disgusted at what you’re doing. Do you think doing this is a joke?” And I am *completely* taken aback. I think she must have the wrong person and ask what I’ve done wrong, to which she replies “really? You’re going to sit there and pretend you don’t know exactly what you’re doing? How can you be so disrespectful and do black face, especially with everything that is happening right now. What is wrong with you?” And she’s waving her hands at me while she’s yelling. My stomach instantly drops when I start making sense of the situation and I start panicking. Word vomit starts tumbling out and I’m trying to tell her that it isn’t like that but she keeps yelling, and finally the manager comes over to the window. I’m in tears at this point, not because she’s yelling at me but because someone actually thinks I’m doing something so incredibly vile toward other human beings. \\n\\nThe manager looks at me panicking, looks at my face and tells the lady to stop talking. I quickly tell the manager that I am *not* in black face, I’m just in a face mask, and I’m incredibly sorry for even leaving the house in it, but I figured it was okay going through a drive thru. The manager sighs really deeply and tells me she can definitely tell that I’m in a face mask, and starts apologizing to me. She tells the lady “Donna, people use face masks for their skin. That is not black face and you have completely embarrassed this customer....” and starts chewing her out right there while I sit there awkwardly. \\n\\nAnyway, I ended up getting our meals for free, but I now know how incredibly stupid it is to leave the house wearing a face mask. \\n\\nTL;DR went through a drive thru in a charcoal face mask, lady yells at me and accuses me of doing black face, I freak out, manager comes and apologizes, I have learned my lesson I currently live in an apartment building in Seattle. Nearby my unit is a man named \"Frank\" and his girlfriend (who is quite vocal, thus why I know her boyfriend\\'s name). Now Frank and his girlfriend have incredibly loud sex throughout the entirety of Friday and Saturday nights. Annoyed by all of the sound and trying to find a way to blot it out, I began a habit a few months ago of playing music (singing, playing guitar) whenever they would start doing the dirty over the course of the last couple months. As an added bonus, I could hear my neighbors yell \"sing\" throughout the night, so I assumed that my playing was a helpful solution to an unfortunate circumstance borne by all of the other neighbors around me.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHowever, tonight, I noticed something kind of strange. They were having sex, per usual, and I began to play music to cover up the sound. I stopped to drink some water between songs, when some of my neighbors started yelling \"play.\" For some reason, though, I didn\\'t do anything for a few seconds, and I heard the guy, Frank\\'s, voice call out \"keep playing or I\\'m not going to cum\" through the walls. I listened a while longer to see if I\\'d heard correctly, and they both kept moaning the same thing. It was at this point that I came to a terrible conclusion. In my attempts to cover up the sound of them having sex, I managed to pull some weird Pavlovian trick where whenever they had sex, I played guitar and sang. Thus, whenever I started to play guitar to cover up an original sound, it just added to their voyeuristic thrill and they started to depend upon it to finish. When I\\'d heard my presumed neighbors yell sing, it was actually Frank and his girlfriend. Unsure if I was right, I started playing another song and when I finished, they were going as hard as possible and moaning heavily so I figured that I\\'d assumed correctly.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy neighbors them get understandably angry that my music playing has made this neighbor couple have sex, so then ***they*** begin to have really rough revenge sex against my wall because they think that I\\'ve caused this problem (which I have). At this point, I\\'m listening to Frank and his girlfriend and the couple next to my wall, one couple horny and one full of revenge, and all of this was because I tried to save myself from listening to sex in the first place.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: here\\'s a video I uploaded as proof that I\\'m actually playing music. They weren\\'t having sex this morning, so everyone will have to leave that part to their imagination.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYOP3n2pxac&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYOP3n2pxac&feature=youtu.be)\\n\\n2nd Edit: Wow, this really blew up. Hopefully everyone enjoyed the story! Regarding proof of their sex, I’m not going to record the sound of my neighbors screwing and upload it to the internet, so my apologies there. To answer everyone’s questions, the song is an original, but I’ve never recorded anything professionally and I play as a hobby.\\n\\n3rd Edit: This a few months later, but some people said that we should try to record the song, so we did! Hope those few that see this enjoy it!   [https://open.spotify.com/track/3XFE8bZTZmaXt9uwWcPBol?si=McCbAVFsQ0C8ih6qmaRNDw](https://open.spotify.com/track/3XFE8bZTZmaXt9uwWcPBol?si=McCbAVFsQ0C8ih6qmaRNDw)\\n\\nTL;DR: Thought I was covering up sex sounds with music, turns out I was serenading a couple while they fucked and keeping them horny all night. Neighbors had angry sex against my bedroom wall as revenge for disturbing their sleep because I acted as a musical facilitator. This happened January, 2018.\\n\\nI was desperate to find a new job and was basically applying for anything that was asking for at least a Bachelor\\'s degree. To provide some background, I graduated with a sciences degree and there was a job posting for a junior risk management position at an accounting firm that allowed folks with a STEM major to apply. And so I did even though I barely knew anything about the field of accounting or risk management. But hey, might as well.\\n\\nSurprisingly, they invited me to do a \"1-on-0\" interview where you basically stare at your computer webcam and answer questions that the company has prepared for you ahead of time while recording your answer... it\\'s a pretty awful experience. However, they were all soft-skill questions so I could answer them pretty decently. After that, I surprisingly got an invitation to have an interview in-person at their office. I was very excited.\\n\\nNow for the fuckup: My family has an assortment of dress shoes that I could wear for the interview and I ended up grabbing a pair that belonged to my late grandpa. They were lookin fresh. I put em on and my parents dropped me off in front of the building.\\n\\nI entered the building and entered the conference room where the other 5 candidates were alongside some company reps. I was cool as a cucumber and just sat in my seat until everyone arrived. Right as everyone got up to enter the \"group case\" room, I looked down at my feet and noticed there were these black things scattered all around my shoes. I quickly deducted that they were shoe crumbs.\\n\\nIt turns out that the shoes I wore were so old and no one had worn them since... a long ass time ago. They were so old that the polymer in the soles were extremely brittle and my shoes were deteriorating in front of my eyes solely due to pressure and friction.\\n\\nAt that moment, I was just thinking \"oh god oh man\" but didn\\'t want to let anyone know about it so after I got up, I pushed in my chair to hide the shoe crumbs. Unluckily for me, everywhere I walked more traces of my shoes came off, leaving a trailing of black shit behind me. It was a nightmare. Thankfully the carpet was greyish color so it wasn\\'t too prominent with my black shoe crumbs but it was only a matter of time before people were going to notice. We walked to a different conference room nearby where we did a group case. It didn\\'t go too well and I left another big mess in there but oh well.\\n\\nAfterwards, we were going to do the in-person interviews with the company directors and partners and divided us into two groups where three of us would go the interview first and the other three would do it after. I was a part of the latter team so we had time to kill. One of the company reps wanted to show us around the two floors and in my mind I was screaming. I wanted to minimize walking to prevent my shoes from breaking off even more.\\n\\nI ended up leaving a trail of crumbs all throughout both floors and then we decided to grab some Starbucks on the main floor. When I went to go grab a straw for my iced coffee, a giant block from my right shoe came off. Holy shit. I kicked it into the little condiments corner and hoped no one saw. We sat down at a table until our turn for interview was approaching. On the way back to the office floor, a second massive chunk came off, this time from my left shoe. However, this time I was in the middle of the cafeteria and couldn\\'t go back to grab it or something. So I just continued walking and just left this black shoe turd in the middle of an open space. At this point, so much of my shoes have fallen off that I was starting to walk weirdly, as my shoes has gotten so much fucked at this point.\\n\\nWe got back to the conference room and the moment I entered the room, I noticed two other people hovering around where I was sitting originally and said \"what\\'s all this black stuff?\" looking at debris I had left earlier. I pretended to not hear them and sat at a different chair, attempting to engage in conversation with someone else. At this point, I was 99% sure everyone knew it was me. However, I continued to play innocent and not acknowledge the amount of debris I was leaving behind everywhere.\\n\\nFinally, it was my turn to do the interview and I walked to yet another office to do it, and of course that meant leaving more shoe crumbs along the way and in the boss\\'s office. He told me he was gonna take a quick bathroom break after we entered and will be right back. I was so glad he did that as I frantically picked up the crumbs that I had already laid waste upon his office and quickly stuffed as much as I could in my pockets while he was gone. As I was doing this, all I could think was \"how did it come to this...\". The interview itself went pretty well though.\\n\\nAfter everyone was done, the reps ended up buying lunch for us at a nearby restaurant. All I can say is RIP to the cleaning staff over there. By the time I got home, you could almost look through my shoe, top-down.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I did not get the job.\\n\\nTL;DR: Wore old af shoes to an interview, the soles began to deteriorate as I walked around and shuffled them, leaving an absolute disaster of a mess all around their offices as I continued to not acknowledge that I was the culprit even though I\\'m very certain everyone knew it was me. This was pre covid in January, and honestly with everything that has happened I think I did my best to forget this.  But I was just reminded due to a past due bill in my emails, and you all seem to love my stories so, enjoy lol.\\n\\nI’m pretty well endowed, and skinny, and flexible, and have the unique talent of being able to suck my own cock.  Judge all you want, make your gay comments, but if you could, you would.  No, it doesn’t quite feel like getting a blow job, just like jerking off doesn’t quite feel like getting a hand job.  But it feels fucking amazing, and i’m a bit of a sexual deviant so it’s just some added freakiness to a normal horny day sometimes.  I love it.  And ex girlfriends have loved it, random hook ups have loved it.  It’s quite a party trick, let me tell you.  Lol.\\n\\nSo I met a girl on Tinder who, for whatever reason, our conversation swayed to this.  We hooked up, she really really enjoyed watching me suck my cock.  Now not to be too descriptive - but i have a very large head of my cock when I’m super turned on.  Which, if I’m sucking my cock I’m super turned on lol.  I can get my mouth around the head, but I can’t get much down the shaft.  especially as not much as I used to.  She kind of put me in these yoga positions to help, and it was insane I was able to get much deeper.\\n\\nLogically, I went home later and researched this and kinds of yoga and decided I was going to go to yoga to get more flexible so I could suck my own cock a little deeper.  Yup.\\n\\nI found a yoga place, signed up, and went to the first few classes.  I enjoyed it, but it wasn’t really helping much and we really weren’t doing the positions that Tinder girl put me in.  The next class, the instructor was helping out, and when she came to me she helped move me a little and it was super helpful.  Not in a self fellating way, but a yoga way.  After class she was chatting with people and to me she mentioned about working on the position at home and how to address it alone.   \\n\\nShe asked if I had been practicing long, and what my intentions with the practice are, and honestly, i don’t know wtf i was thinking, but I fucking said it.  I said it!  Super non-chalantly too, I said “well, it’s to help with sucking my own dick”  \\n\\nShe didn’t laugh.  She didn’t say “what?”.  She just walked away.  Like quickly and angrily.  Not sure if anyone else around me heard, but it felt like I said it over the loud speaker.  I was cringing beyond belief and couldn’t even hear anything but my heartbeat. I just grabbed my shit and left as quickly as I could.\\n\\nThe next day, I got a call from the studio saying the don’t tolerate sexual harassment or inappropriate behavior of any kind.  I am banned from all 4 of their establishments and I am lucky the instructor doesn’t want to press charges.  I wrote back apologizing and saying it came out wrong, but it sounded defensive, it is absolutely insane that I said that.  \\n\\nI think i’m done with yoga.  And I’ll just be okay with my self sucking skills as they are.\\n\\ntl:dr - went to yoga to get more flexible so i could suck my cock deeper.  and I told the instructor.\\n\\nedit - to answer some public and private questions... \\nsure, I guess it feels like a dick is in your mouth, but in the same way jerking off feels like a dick in your hand, or playing with your pussy feels like you’re playing with a pussy (i’m guessing, lol).  to me the pleasure is the focal point.  but i’m kinky and weird, so who knows.  i’m guessing to enjoy it, you have to be comfortable with your own dick in your own mouth.  big deal.  i’m more than comfortable with that.\\n\\nand onto the next question.  yes, I cum in my mouth.  Not every time, but i have many times.  judge away\\n\\nedit 2:  yes I have swallowed.  often the position requires i swallow or id spit it up all over myself.\\n\\nedit 3: yes, i’ve cum on my face.  i don’t think i’m the only guy that’s done that, that’s happened just jerking off before.\\n\\nedit 4: okay, the photos in women’s thongs are a a whole other story.  that doesn’t make me gay still, i’m not confused.  i just know what i like sexually!\\n\\nedit 5:  my r4r posts.... yes, I have met up before just to jerk off for them.  no i have never met someone before to do this act.\\n\\nedit 6: I’m 41 years old\\n\\nedit 7:  I first tried sucking my cock in my teen years when i realized i was well-endowed.  i thought that self-sucking was the benefit of a big dick, later I learned about girls and stuff.\\n\\nedit 8: some of you are very mean, lol.  to go out of your way to DM me the things you’re saying is weirder than sucking your own cock.  who cares what I do.\\n\\nedit 9:  i know i fucked up!  i was totally wrong and I believe she would be well within her rights to press charges against me and I’m very thankful she didn’t.\\n\\nedit 10:  damn people got real mean once this ended up on the front page.  yikes.  i guess the tifu crowd is a little more accepting than the popular crowd.  that was fun for a while but not really any more.  goodnight! I have been working from home recently (obviously), and I am pretty fortunate because basically there is no function of my job I need to be in the office for. But I have let some bad habits seep in. \\n\\nI\\'m sure anyone in an office knows that like 80% of the meetings you attend could probably just be an email. But since we are meeting via Zoom, and since a lot of people don\\'t even enable video, if I am in a meeting I know isn\\'t important and where I probably won\\'t even have to speak, I just mute myself and go sit on the sofa and play a video game on mute or browse the internet or whatever. Or eat lunch. \\n\\nI have an odd quirk that I do when I eat by myself. I talk to my food and to myself. On the day in question my lunch I had a sandwich and some pita chips with hummus. So, for example, I said something like \"Mmmmm, there\\'s hummus among us!\" Or when I had a chip I would say things like \"That\\'s what I call a chip!\" or \"Welcome to my Mouth, Mr. Pita!\" \\n\\nAnd the sandwich, I pretended it insulted me, so I was like \"Did you just call me a bitch? Hooo boy, you just buttered the wrong biscuit. NOM NOM NOM NOM!!!\" Or later I would comfort it, like \"Don\\'t worry, had my fiber gummy, you\\'re coming out smooth. Mm hmmmm.\" \\n\\nI wasn\\'t really listening to what was happening in the meeting, but finally I heard my name a few times. To my horror, I had not muted my mic. They heard it all. My Manager was saying rather curtly, \"Can you please mute yourself?\" Some people were laughing. I mumbled an apology and muted myself. I got a stern message from him later saying I should wait for lunch until after a meeting, and if i had to eat during a meeting, mute myself. \\n\\nIn our Slack channels people are making fun of for talking to my food. But it is clear, they think I am insane. In the eyes of my Manager I have lost all stature, and in the eyes of my co-workers I am a lunatic. This could have negative effects on my career. I am actually thinking of quitting tomorrow. \\n\\nTL;DR - I didn\\'t mute myself during a Zoom meeting and my boss and co-workers heard me talking to my food. I recently closed my lease in Florida to move back into my dad’s house, in Chicago. I’m working from home, don’t need to be paying rent in FL if I can just live with family instead.\\n\\nSo, I pack my shit up, store the rest in a storage unit, close my lease, and hit the road. My cat, Randall Flagg, accompanied me in the car as we drove through Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, and then Kentucky.\\n\\nI was going about 105 mph in a 70 MPH zone when the KY State Trooper pulled me over. I was making incredible time moving that quickly, but obviously the risk is being pulled over. Or death.\\n\\nAnyway, State Trooper comes to the passenger side of my car to stay away from highway speed traffic. My car was already off, so my window did not roll down when I tried that. Instead, he opened the door.\\n\\nDuring the discussion, we actually addressed the fact that my cat Randall could escape, and I asked if I could step out and keep the car sealed. That didn’t end up happening.\\n\\nAfter the traffic stop, maybe about a minute of driving later, I realize Randall is not in the car anymore.\\n\\n*Bolt of absolute panic*\\n\\nI pull over, again. This time without a state trooper behind me. I frantically shout for him inside the car. Check the foot boxes, seats, his little nooks, Nothing.\\n\\nMy mind racing, I leave the car on the side of the highway, and begin running back south to where I was pulled over. I reach the area, completely spent. Voice is totally thrashed from shouting over the sound of the highway for Randall.\\n\\nThe women who lives next to the highway, where I was pulled over, hasn’t seen him.\\n\\nI have burrs all over my shoes and shorts from tromping through the Kentucky woods and fields next to the highway.\\n\\nI call the non-emergency number, my vet, my mom. Dad.\\n\\n45 minutes of shouting and walking along the highway.\\n\\nSerious emotional distress. My boy, my best bud is lost in these fucking woods somewhere.\\n\\nI see a state trooper nearby, he’s very helpful and actually drives me back around to the area I lost Randall to keep looking, and gets the officer who pulled me over to come back also.\\n\\nNo luck.\\n\\nI interact with more nice families in the area, leaving my number with them.\\n\\nRandall Flagg is hiding somewhere out there and he is too scared to come out.\\n\\nOr. God forbid. He was hit. Cant think about that right now.\\n\\nThe officers help me relax, take me back to my car back north up the highway.\\n\\nA detective with the troopers helps me look around the car again, just in case. No Randall.\\n\\nMy car is now dead when I try to start it bc the hazards were on too long.\\n\\nGreat. I have some jumper cables stuffed inside somewhere, but it’s full of my shit as I’m moving, so I have to start pulling things out. The Trooper with me didn’t have cables, somehow.\\n\\nSo I’m pulling bags out to access the area where the cables are, when I see motherfucking Randall Flagg’s fuzzy black ass inside a half-full garbage bag that had a lot of my clothes and towels in it.\\n\\nHe’s totally asleep, peaceful as a fat baby.\\n\\nI apologize to the officers profusely but they are completely professional about it, just glad that he’s been found. They help me jump my car, and I get rollin again.\\n\\nStayed much closer to the speed limit after that.\\n\\nRandall Flagg and I safely made it to Chicago the next day. He’s extremely comfortable here at my dads.\\n\\nTL;DR I was pulled over and my [cat](https://imgur.com/a/7J6PxRU) escaped into the Kentucky woods next to a highway, but not really, he was just asleep in my car. I worked on my cardio and made friends in rural Kentucky while looking for him. Edit: REDDIT: my mom(who I told this story) is 100% going to find my Reddit now.... pleeeease no creepy shit, this is NOT SEXY ITS GROSS. >.<  apparently I am a sweet summer child and did not think this post through*\\n\\nI(32f)got lost in my favorite hiking park (it’s huge). I thought I was deep in the woods. I was pulling my two toddlers behind me in one of those cart things you can hitch to the back of a bike for kids to ride in. I rigged it like a stroller but it got too hard to push... so I used the wrist strap and tied it to my back belt loop. Had just climbed a huge hill 3x going back and forth (lost). I had tracked through a swamp and was covered in mud. Again, I thought I was deep in the park and hadn’t seen another person all day. \\n\\nSo .....boob sweat is a thing. I ditched my bra and was wearing a loose tank with buttons all the way down the front. I undid them all. Was at a level of “fuck it we are all going to die here”. GPS was not working.\\n\\nAnd then ....I stumbled into a field adjacent to a parking lot I’d never been to before. Into a crowd of 14yos and their parents. Some had grad gowns. I had my tits flapping in the wind, my progeny hauled behind me (tied to my butt, like the banana boat girl), and mud almost to my elbows.\\n\\nA nice gentlemen offered me directions. I was less than half a mile from my car -_-\\n\\nFuck. My. Life.\\n\\nTL;DR: Basically the title. I got lost and got in the woods. Flashed a bunch of middle schoolers. WARNING: THIS IS A LONG ONE. SCROLL DOWN TO THE TL;DR IF YOU DON\\'T WANT THE FULL STORY. \\n\\nYeah... I f***ed up today. See, I\\'ve been dating my GF (K) for 5 years. We are deeply in love, we have pets together, we live together, etc. I\\'ve wanted to propose to her for about 2 years. The reason I haven\\'t is that about 2 years ago, I got diagnosed with a rare disease and have been on and off several medications and chemotherapy. \\n\\nIt\\'s been VERY rough on the two of us, but K has stuck with  me every step of the way. My disease, GPA, is chronic, deadly when left alone, and tough to beat in my particular case. I\\'m starting drugs that haven\\'t been FDA approved for my condition. All other typical forms of treatment have failed and things are kinda bleak, but not terrible just yet. This new drug is promising, but hasn\\'t been guaranteed to work. I\\'m terrified to say the least. All of this medical stuff has prevented me from being able to go outside, let alone commit to anything serious. \\n\\nI want to be healthy and stable before I even think about marriage. I don\\'t want to leave K as a widow with no support! K & I had talked here and there about getting married, but had always come to the conclusion that I needed to go into remission first. We agreed to it, or so I thought. Flash foreword to a few hours ago and K is with MY FAMILY in a public restaurant, holding a ring and getting down on one knee. \\n\\nI saw my father, who has an extensive history of butting into my private affairs without asking to be involved, with his eyes wide and smiling. I immediately started freaking out. First thought: I haven\\'t even gone into remission yet and I have no clue if I\\'m going to get better. I cannot get married and then hear that the drugs aren\\'t working. What if I die from all of this? Second thought: GODDAMN IT DAD! Why do you always have to try and manipulate everything from behind the scenes?!\\n\\nI guess I\\'m coming off as a bit of a brat here, but my Dad was a very involved parent when I was young. When I entered High-school, my father would play me up to college recruiters, my boss at the time, and to teachers. The expectations would get so high that I couldn\\'t live up to them. Similar situations happened with friends and extended family as well. Both my brothers and I find this to be a real problem, if my Dad is left unchecked. I would go more in depth, but that is a post for another r/. Back to the story!\\n\\nAnyway, I\\'m freaking out. I just start sputtering the first words that come out of my mouth. Sadly those words came out as a hodgepodge of \"no-nno waaay!\" With my heart beating out of my chest and a lump in my throat, I ran out of the building... I made the love of my life cry as I selfishly drove off and everyone in the restaurant dropped their jaws. I\\'ve never felt so ashamed in my life... After calming down, I talked to my Mother, and drove back to talk to K.\\n\\nIn the parking lot, without my family, we discussed what went down. Tears were shed and things were said. K told me I was being selfish. \"We\\'ve been dating for years, who cares if you die, I want to marry you!\" She also explained that the whole proposal was her idea, my dad had nothing to do with it. She understood why I would be paranoid about my dad though. K understands that my Dad has boundary issues and admitted that it would have been better if she didn\\'t include them.\\n\\nIn the end, we reconciled. We made up, decided that I was being redicules and paranoid, and she wasn\\'t forthcoming with her real feelings on marriage, engagement, and how my disease effects our relationship. We came to the conclusion that we should be engaged. We want to spend the rest of our lives together, no matter what the circumstances.\\n\\nNow I\\'m engaged, still have no idea if my new drug is gonna save me, but if I do end up in an even worse place medically during it all, I\\'ll be with my best friend/lover. K is my world, and I\\'m an idiot for ever considering not spending my life with her. \\n\\nThanks for listening.\\n\\n\\n\\nTL;DR\\nI said no when my GF proposed bc I\\'m on chemo and don\\'t know if I\\'m gonna go into remission or die. Decided I was being stupid and reversed my idiotic decision to yes.\\n\\nEDIT: Thank you so very much for the silver, gold and platinum! I always answer calls from unknown callers. Not sure why, I guess it feels like my ticket to adventure and mystery. This habit almost always works out fine. It\\'s typically a wrong number call. I\\'ll pick up the phone, say hello, and the person apologizes and hangs up. \\n\\nBut lately I\\'ve been getting a lot of spam calls about some car I don\\'t own. Almost every other day they call me, and it gets annoying. So I\\'ve started answering in strange ways. You know the drill, pretending you\\'re from a Denny\\'s in New Mexico, pretending to be a scammer, etc. No harm done, right?\\n\\nWell, just a few minutes ago, I got a call from an unknown number. I thought it was the car people. So I answered, in my best peppy receptionist voice: \"This is Jimmy\\'s euthanasia clinic and buffet, where yesterday\\'s loss goes in the sauce! How may I help you today?\" There was a long pause. After a few seconds, I said, \"Just kidding. This is \\\\[my name\\\\]. Who is this?\" A few shuffling noises came from the other end, then silence. I hung up.\\n\\nAbout thirty seconds later, I got a call from the same number. I said hello like a normal human being, and the caller introduced himself. It was the tech guy. From my school. He was calling to follow up on a very professional, respectful email I sent him a few months ago about school-issued computers. \\n\\nYikes.\\n\\nTL;DR I answered what I thought was a spam call and said something stupid. It was from someone at my school. This just happened an hour ago. He is lying sleeping next to me as I\\'m typing this.\\n\\nIt\\'s a thing between me and my boyfriend to point at large phallic things and go \"babe,sit on it\" or to poke your finger at the others butt (when the other has underwear on were not that weird) \\n\\nToday I took a bath and right after I inspected my face in the bedrooms mirror for pimples. I treat them with tea tree oil, which I drop onto said cotton swabs. \\n\\nHere\\'s were I fucked up. He was lying on the bed naked. Bottom up. I was treating my face with the oil and he was being sassy with me so I went to him and stuck the cotton swab in his ass. At first he was laughing. That didn\\'t last long. His eyes got wide and he yells \"my ass is on fire\" while running to the bathroom. He tried getting the oil off with a wet cloth but to no avail. \\n\\nTLDR: I lit the beacons in my boyfriends ass by sticking a cotton swab with tea tree oil on it in his ass.\\n\\nEdit : thanks for the silver, kind stranger\\n\\nSecond Edit : thanks for the gold, kind stranger Literally happened ten minutes ago, the fallout has yet to happen.\\n\\n\\nBit of a backstory, I (26M) live about 45 minutes from my parents house, and my eldest sister (30F) lives across the street from me but works close to my rents.\\n\\n\\nMy parents, and my youngest sister (15F) are out of town on vacation. Now, I generally go to my parents house to work on my truck (my dad has spent a lot of money on his truck, and thus has a well stocked garage. Plus I live in an apartment complex and don’t have a garage).\\n\\n\\nSo I’m going over there to do a few things, put some braided stainless brake lines on, and do an oil change.\\n\\n\\nThis is where it happens. Now, my parents have two dogs. And I was trying to sneak into the house and being as quiet as possible, as I knew my eldest sister was house sitting and I didn’t want them to lose their shit.\\n\\n\\nThis is where the fuckup happens.\\n\\n\\nIt works. I’m quiet. I sneak into the house, and silently close the door. I heard some strange noises coming from the living room, so I go, thinking the dogs were playing.\\n\\n\\nIt was not the dogs playing.\\n\\n\\nIt was, in fact, my eldest sister and her boyfriend. On the couch.\\n\\nWith her sitting on his lap facing away from him, towards me with her eyes closed.\\n\\n\\nI have now seen my sisters birthday suit being penetrated by her boyfriend.\\n\\n\\nI also now know what my sisters face looks like in this process. \\n\\n\\nAnd what she sounds like.\\n\\n\\nI literally screamed “my eyes” covered them and ran out of the house.\\n\\n\\nI’m outside, sitting in my truck contemplating my life.\\n\\n\\nSend help.\\n\\n\\n\\nTL;DR Parents home is vacant other than my sister dog sitting. Went to work on my truck, saw my sister getting worked on, reverse cowgirl style.\\n\\n\\nEdit: Based on a lot of the responses, apparently reddit wants me to either A) Describe my sisters tits, B) Make a porno, or C) Go all r/sweethomealabama with her.\\nY’all are animals.\\n\\nEdit 2: Holy shit this blew up. Damn. What happened after was as I was sitting in my truck, they left. I went into the garage and did my work. We haven’t talked yet. I’m gonna give it a few weeks for the memory to not be burned into my skull. Obligatory “happened a few years ago etc” but basically there was this walking/bike path near my house that I would occasionally walk along for exercise.\\n\\nSometimes, while walking, I’d set myself a personal goal, like “reach that pole by the end of this song” or whatever (I listened to music while I walked).\\n\\nWell, one time I saw someone walking in front of me. They were a considerable distance ahead of me, but I decided that my goal that night was to overtake them by the time I reached my turnaround point.\\n\\nSo I started walking faster to catch up and overtake them, and realised it was a woman. At the time I didn’t think anything of it, because, hey, we’re both on the same walking path for the same reason; getting healthy.\\n\\nAs I slowly yet surely got closer to her, I noticed she would occasionally turn her head and look behind her. I’d had a couple close calls with people riding bikes along the path (my fault, I only really owned dark colours), so whenever she looked behind her, I’d turn around and look behind me, because I thought she may have heard a bike bell that I hadn’t heard over my music. Meanwhile I kept my speed up because I was on pace to beat her in our race to my turnaround point.\\n\\nNear to my turnaround point it gets quite dark, because trees hang over the path; and it’s of course here that I finally catch up with her..\\n\\nAs I get within two metres of her, she suddenly spins around and enters into what I can only describe as a karate/taekwondo attack position (legs braced and arms ready). Aimed directly at me.\\n\\nI immediately realise what I’ve done (wearing dark colours, looking behind me when she did, powerwalking towards her).\\nI gave her the most awkward smile in the world while I powerwalked past her, walked WAYY past my turnaround point so I could avoid her on the way back, and seriously considered powerwalking myself off the nearest cliff.\\n\\nAs an added “bonus”, I later learned that there was a notorious rapist named “the bike path rapist” that operated in that specific area of the bike path a few years prior.\\n\\nTL;DR Decided to race a stranger without their knowledge, awkwardly followed them, caught up to them in the darkest section of the path, nearly got Bruce Lee’d, awkwardly smiled and powerwalked away. I\\'m a salty fucker. I\\'ll admit that from the jump. I can\\'t stand the family that lives across the street because their kid is always fucking freaking out and screaming, slapping shit, having tantrums, throwing shit across the street and into my yard...you name it, he does it. I can literally hear his fucking tantrums from my house across the way. He\\'s a little fucking hellion. \\n\\nHis hobby, other than having shitfits, seems to be hanging out right by the picture window and staring me down when I get into my car and leave for work. I got so sick of being stared at by this little asshole, so I flipped him off and gave him a nasty look as I was getting into my car. He immediately started screaming and crying. As I drove off, I felt...weirdly satisfied. Seriously, it was the most fulfilled I\\'d felt in WEEKS. So, I immediately did it again the next day, the next one after that, and the day after that. Each time he\\'d start screaming and freaking out. It made me bitterly happy.\\n\\nThis morning, as I was getting ready to leave, I saw the demon child in the window again...giving me THE STARE...and I flipped him off. Only this time I heard the bellow of \"HEY FUCKER!\". The kid\\'s fucking dad had been standing behind him and I didn\\'t see him. I sprinted into my car just as he came running out of the house. I got in before he caught up with me, but that still didn\\'t stop him from throwing a potted plant at my tail light.\\n\\nI\\'m at my girlfriend\\'s place right now; my roommate tells me that the fucking psycho has been to the house twice looking for me. Kind of dreading going back; thinking that I\\'ll just hang out here for the long weekend and hope it all blows over.\\n\\nTL;DR: I\\'ve been flipping off my nasty little four year old troll of a neighbor for almost a week now. His daddy caught me doing it this morning and now I\\'m probably gonna get my ass beat. I almost died Liz Lemon-style, choking alone in my apartment. Easily one of the scariest moments ever. I was talking to a friend on the phone and eating a burger recently. My friend, B, said something funny and he’s pretty talkative. I wanted to get a quick response in (like a couple words that didnt even matter. Something like “i know, right?!”) so i swallowed and went to talk. Only no words came out. \\n\\nI wasnt even really coughing. It was lodged solidly in my throat and the more I struggled the further down it slid. Slowly. B noticed and asked if I was choking and i couldnt respond so i just kind of coughed into the phone to confirm it. He tried to call 911 but lives in another state that will not connect you to another state’s emergency services so it wasnt going to be quick enough. And theres like multiple locked doors for them to get through before they even get to me anyway. \\n\\nI was going to die. I started not being able to stand and started getting tunnel vision. I had tears and snot streaming down my face into my open mouth and didnt even care. I shoved my entire hand down my throat and nothing. Remember how i said i wasnt coughing and it was sitting in my throat? I had to actually make myself cough to move it at all. \\n\\nAnd then as i randomly started thinking of irrelevant things (i was losing consciousness and my focus was fading) i remembered this thing my ex liked when id go down on him. I had learned how to utilize my throat muscles in uhh interesting ways. So with my last ounce of energy i manipulated my throat muscles and forced them to shove the food back up. I threw up a golfball sized chunk of food right into my hands and stared at it (why was it so big?! Did i not chew AT ALL?!) before I threw it away and collected myself. \\n\\nYall i sat there stunned for like 5 minutes while B frantically begged me to tell him I was okay. I finally burst out laughing in relief and confirmed what was happening. Then i told him what i did to save myself and we both cracked up. But holy shit man, next time i might not be so lucky. \\n\\nTL;DR: I almost died. I gotta learn the self heimlich, i guess. Edit1: Technically \"trimmed\" not \"shaved\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo the TIFU happened last night, but this requires some background explanation...\\n\\nThis is gonna be TMI, but that\\'s kinda the nature of TIFU, so whatever. I\\'m a sporty person, mountain biking, hiking year round, etc. I also have apparently a hairy butthole, which means wiping the ol\\' pooper can be somewhat of a chore at times. Sometimes, unbeknowst to me, not everything gets removed, and I don\\'t know if you have ever let somewhat digested stomach acid (AKA the Taco Bell runs) gently rub between your greater cheeks for an entire day before, but it AIN\\'T FUN. So I had the bright idea to shave my bunghole. Less hair, less clean-up, less chance of rectum-related-rashes on the next mountain bike ride. So I trimmed it off at night, added some Aquaphor to the affected area (that stuff is magic), and the wiping job is smooth as butter the next day. Win-win!\\n\\nFast forward two days, and I\\'m going on a first date with a pretty cute girl. Classic dinner and dessert kinda thing, cuz she\\'s like the best looking girl I\\'ve dated, so I wanna shell out the monies of course. Dinner went pretty well, and we got Coldstone afterward, and then we decided to head to my place (hoping my roommates aren\\'t home) for a movie. Turns out they aren\\'t home...which is extra nice, because we both were throwing mad hints to each other about how attractive we found each other.\\n\\nBut, guys, I can feel it building...inside me...the gas, not the sexual tension, unfortunately.  We\\'re sitting there on the couch watching a movie, and I just had to let one out. I\\'m usually pretty good at silent farts, so I\\'m not paying attention to the fact that we\\'re in a quiet spot in the movie. And this fart was NOT SILENT! It was the loudest, flappiest, most percussive fart I\\'ve ever had in my entire life, hands down. I was mortified. She immediately turned her head toward me with an expression of pure disgust, and I of course was super smooth about it and tried to awkward-laugh it off, which is my response to most tense social situations. She did not laugh with me...No text-backs so far.\\n\\nI googled it this morning, and it turns out shaving your butt makes your farts extra loud, cuz your buttcheeks slap around with no hair to muffle the sound. So a little TIL there for you inside this TIFU. Just waiting for my anal fuzz to grow back now, so I can go on dates again.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit2: Man I shouldve used my real account for the awards! Guess I\\'ll have to switch over to this baby.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR - I shaved my butthole to make wiping easier and prevent rashes. Turns out it makes your farts super loud, which I discovered during a movie in my apartment on a date, which ended awkwardly and soon after. This was not today but last winter (I am in Ohio so it gets very cold). A funny tale of accidental racism. I work as a night nurse at a busy hospital. A good friend/coworker of mine is from Liberia in Africa. We will call him Jim. We had been friends for a few years before this and my friend had just gotten back from a month long trip to Liberia to see his family. \\n\\nWe had just finished a crazy night shift and were walking out to our cars outside the hospital. Now this being pre-corona the parking lot was swarming with patients’ families and workers coming in for their day shift. It was about 20 degrees F (-7C) out that morning and snow was coming down like mad. So Jim starts walking more towards his car and I towards mine. It being so cold I shout out “HEY I BET YOU WISH YOU WERE BACK IN AFRICA HUH JIM”. It took me about 2 seconds to realize how bad that sounded. As I look around to see if anyone noticed about 6 people were looking at me baffled.\\n The next day I told him what happened and all the looks I got and man did he have a good laugh.\\n\\nTL;DR: I yelled something at a coworker that sounded kinda racist out of context. Coworker thought it was funny.\\n\\nEdit: Thanks for all the likes and comments guys! I need to sleep but I am glad some of you got a chuckle! For those who don’t see the racism part I totally get it. It was more the other people’s reaction that made it feel like they thought I was racist. If that makes any sense. But anyway rascism is very fucked. Love each other damn it. Sorry about the formatting, I\\'m on mobile. \\n\\nMe (23f) and my boyfriend (22m) have both been struggling with mental health stuff recently so we\\'ve not really been *in the mood* (if you know what I mean).\\nSo today we were making out and things were starting to get a little heated so my boyfriend asks me to check there\\'s nobody else home. Normally he means to just check out of the window and see if either of his parents cars are in the driveway which they weren\\'t so I tell him we\\'re all good. We proceed to have very loud, somewhat kinky sex. \\nAfter we\\'re finished he goes to the bathroom to clean up and makes a jokey comment about how we left the bedroom door open and that it\\'s a good thing nobody else is home. Then we realise we can smell food cooking. I never checked if his younger sister was in the house. She definitely heard us and everything that was said during. I have never been more embarrassed.\\n\\nTL,DR: me and boyfriend have kinky sex, his younger sister is in the house and definitely heard us. I\\'m in marketing, particularly in the business of slogans. So, a few days ago I was writing the slogan for this local wine-and-pizza restaurant and they told me they had a problem: They had an uncharacteristically shitty location.\\n\\nThere\\'s no way people were just finding this place on their own. It was buried on the backside of a fucking strip mall on a desolate road 10 miles outside of town. So, of course with a location like that, foot traffic was suffering and the business as a whole was failing.\\n\\nLast night, I went there to get some food... for research, ya know... Anyway, I was surprised at the atmosphere and the quality of the meal. The pizza was really good. The beer selection was varied. They had a little play area where parents could drink and watch their kids play in a pretty fancy jungle gym. Pretty good stuff. Even if I wasn\\'t writing for them, I would\\'ve given them 5 stars on Yelp, is what I mean.\\n\\nWhen I was driving home it dawned on me... the way to get this place on the map (literally) was to make it feel like a destination unto itself.\\n\\nI wrote a lot of garbage for a while (\"Where Wine Country Is Next Door!\"), but I was determined to get something usable. \\n\\nFinally, it hit me: \"Go Somewhere.\" It had nearly everything I wanted... a sense of agency and urgency, a subtle association with class and elegance, the claim that this place was, indeed, somewhere to be.\\n\\nBut, still, it wasn\\'t quite there. It lacked the feel I wanted, felt a little too abstract. Customers didn\\'t need to just go *somewhere,* but rather a particular direction. They needed to be pointed.\\n\\nAfter another hour or so, I had it.\\n\\nEventually, the slogan I pitched these poor people was this:\\n\\n\"Go Somewhere Else\"\\n\\nWhich, I believe the corporate equivalent of is like \"Get the fuck out of my face.\"\\n\\nThey haven\\'t emailed me back.\\n\\nTL;DR: Today I fucked up by not thinking of the whole context of a slogan I wrote and I\\'m pretty sure I definitely lost a client because of it. \\nBecause of certain circumstances, I\\'ve been doing online college while living with my grandma. It\\'s honestly been so fun. She\\'s amazing and even helped me dye my hair bright red last week. (This plays an important role in the story). \\n\\n\\nUsually to relieve stress, I \\'pet the kitty\\'. I didn\\'t bring any toys with me, so I had to improvise. I resorted to a method that I\\'ve been doing long before I bought my first toy; the bathtub faucet.\\n\\n\\nBasically, you position your body beneath the faucet and let the water hit your clit. It works wonders. Ladies, I would\\'ve highly recommended this if it weren\\'t for today. \\n\\n\\nSo tonight, I told my gran I\\'m taking a bath. I double checked to make sure the door was locked and went to town. I guess because of the water being close to my ears, I couldn\\'t hear my grandma. \\n\\n\\nUnbeknownst to me, my grandma HAD A KEY TO THE BATHROOM. She got worried I wasn\\'t responding and decided to check on me. She opened the door and started screaming which resulted in me screaming back. Apparently, my hair colour started to run and made it look like I was in a pool of blood. \\n\\n\\nMy grandma freaked out, ran towards me and started shaking me. I had to reassure her that I\\'m completely okay. I made up a lie saying I put conditioner in my hair and had to let it soak in the tub. She seemed pretty shaken up and had to take a pill to calm down. I\\'m currently writing this while sitting next to her.\\n\\n\\nI feel so terrible for scaring this poor, old woman. I never found out what she wanted originally. On top of that, I didn\\'t even get to orgasm. \\n\\n\\nI added a pic to show what the scene looked like.\\n\\n[pic](https://flic.kr/p/2kezHop)\\n\\n\\nEdit: wow I honestly didn\\'t expect this to get a lot of attention or awards. I\\'m so glad you guys enjoyed the drawing. I\\'m now dropping out of university to pursue a career as an artist. Thank you for being amused by my embarrassment. Grandma is doing very well today. I found out that she originally wanted to know what kind of pie I wanted: apple or banana.\\n\\nEdit 2: no, she didn\\'t make pie\\n\\n\\nTL;DR  \\n\\nI didn\\'t hear my grandma calling me while I was masturbating. My grandma opened the bathroom and thought I was dead because I was laying down in the bathtub with my legs up and my red hair made the water look like blood This just happened a few minutes ago. I’m still shaking like a leaf but I’m slowly starting to realize how hilarious the situation was.\\n\\nSo I (F18) recently began drinking cream soda. The bottles look a bit like beer bottles, but it never really dawned on me how similar they were until now.\\n\\nA few minutes ago I was sitting in my car at a red light. There was a half-drunk bottle of in the car, so I drank some of it while I was sitting at the light. There was a cop car in the lane next to me, but I didn’t think anything of it.\\n\\nThe light turns green and I go, the cop instantly pulls behind me and turns on full sirens and lights. I was shocked because I’d just pulled forward at a light. I was barely going 10 miles an hour, the light was green, I wasn’t on my phone, I couldn’t think of anything I’d done wrong. But I was the only car he could be signaling to so I pulled over, and this guy gets out of his car and comes over to me as I’m digging around for my license and registration. \\n\\nHe knocked on the window and said “ma’am I need you to step out of the vehicle right now” and I’m sitting there thinking “what the hell is going on? What did I do?” but I complied because I’m an anxiety ridden person and I was terrified of what I might be in trouble for. He looked at me for a moment and said “Ma’am have you been drinking?” and I said “no, I’m 18.” He looked into my car, frowned, reached in, grabbed the bottle out of my cup holder and said “Oh.”\\n\\nAfter some apologizing on his part and awkward laughter, he explained that he’d seen the bottle and thought that it contained beer rather than soda. I was in shock and wasn’t sure how to react so I just awkwardly laughed and said “oh yeah...sorry...it’s soda....” meanwhile I’m standing there shaking because the situation seemed so so bizarre. Cop got back in his car and drove off, and I’m still not sure what happened😂\\n\\nTL;DR: I drank cream soda at a stop light, and a cop pulled me over because he thought it was beer, resulting in me being scared sh*tless because I had no idea what was going on.    When I was around 12 years old and just discovering masturbation I had a hard time figuring out where I should \"unload\" it. I was too afraid to bring tissues into my room as it seemed too obvious so eventually, with my galaxy brain, I realized I could just shoot it down in the gap between my bed and wall. At this point I hadn\\'t quite fully developed object permanence and for over a year assumed it was \"evaporating\" or something down there, out of sight out of mind... until it was time to paint. \\n\\n   With both of my parents in my room, unscrewing outlet covers, laying blue tape etc. I decided to move my bed and, to my horror a year\\'s worth of cum was crusted, running down the wall. I quickly moved it back and tried to devise some reason for why we should paint another day, I decided that if I went and cooked something I could force my parents to come out and eat it while I went back in my room and painted over all the fucking CUM on my wall. Then not only would I be a good boy for cooking dinner, I would also be a good boy for having painted on my own with the added bonus of saving myself some embarrassment.\\n\\n  I don\\'t remember what I cooked but I wasn\\'t fast enough, when I came back in my mom was on her knees scrapping all the dry, flakey cum with some sort of metal tool. Before I could say anything she looked at me and said \"This is DISGUSTING. Why would you SPIT all over your wall? If you need to spit do it in the toilet, or just swallow it but you can\\'t spit all over your walls, why would you do that?\"\\n\\n  I\\'m almost certain she knew what it was and was saving me from embarrassment, and for that she\\'s a real trooper. I\\'m 21 now so it may be time to just ask.\\n\\nTL;DR: I used to cum on the wall next to my bed, my mom moved it and well.... cum wall\\n\\n\\nEDIT: This got bigger than I expected so I\\'ll add a couple things. \\n\\n1. There was no possible way I could brag to my friends about all the karma I\\'ve just aquired without explaining to them what a cum wall is. Naturally they now know what a cum wall is.\\n\\n2. I take slight comfort in the fact that unlike the shoebox and coconut this mural, as much of a work of art as it was, was never meant to be erected\\n\\n3. I\\'m seeing the links to creepily similar stories, looking at my post history you should be able to tell I\\'m not a troll, I don\\'t even post a lot, just happened to be reminded of this by something a friend said last night.\\n\\n4. It may comfort some of you to know my current living space is the exact opposite of a neckbeard nest, girls say I\\'m \"really clean for a guy\". So not a neckbeard, I just be cummin doe So I guess this is a bit of a change from your normal TIFU posts but I felt like sharing anyways.\\n\\nSo this just happened like an hour ago. I’m sure you all have heard about the “revamping” of the FaceApp where you can literally age a photo of yourself. For those who don’t know what I’m talking about, [here](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/faceapp-old-age-face-photographic-filter-mobile-app-development-russia/) is a good reference for you.\\n\\nAnyways, so I saw someone post a picture to their Instagram and that’s how I heard about it. I knew I had to download it and try it out...because why not?\\n\\nSo I download the app, take a picture and set the filter. \\n\\nAnd OMG I’m totally old lol. It’s kinda crazy, and I’m not gonna lie...I look good as an old dude.\\n\\nI decided to send the results with the original picture  to some friends and family who just die laughing at the filtered image. We start comparing pics and wonder if that’s how we will really look in the years to come.\\n\\nThen a thought pops into my head...\\n\\nEveryone tells me I look just like my dad, and if that’s true maybe he will get a kick out of this photo too! So I send it away!\\n\\n...Nope.\\n\\nHe isn’t excited, and he isn’t laughing. He said it freaks him out.\\n\\nI asked him why, and assured him it’s just a harmless filter.\\n\\nWhat he said next broke my heart.\\n\\n“I know I’ll never see you that old.”\\n\\nTL;DR: I used the crazed FaceApp to send a photo of my old ass self to my dad, resulting in him being really sad and breaking my heart. Fuck.\\n\\nEdit: Whoah!! Did not expect this response. Thank you strangers for my first gold!!!\\n\\nEdit 2: Thank you for my second and third gold!!! Wow. This happened today, 8:30am.\\n\\nI cannot even try to make an excuse for how I could have literally forgotten a vital piece of clothing.\\n\\nI got pretty close. I donned my favourite opaque tights and chose my shirt then I proceeded to get distracted by some forms I had to complete online, ran short on time, put on my long winter parka and left the house.\\n\\nI got up to the interview feeling very comfortable and fifteen minutes early. As the receptionist told me to go hang up my coat I gladly walked over to do so. I began to unzip my jacket, looked down and for a brief moment I thought my skirt had just ridden up on my commute. Nope, nothing there. Luckily I never fully took off my jacket.\\n\\nI proceeded to turn on my heel and leave. I got downstairs but was still holding the coat hanger.\\n\\nI didn’t want to be a theif on top of just leaving abruptly. So I then took the elevator back up, claimed a family issue, and returned the coat hanger.\\n\\nSilver living is they let me reschedule. So now I have an interview for later this afternoon. In about an hour.\\n\\nTL;DR Left my house without any pants on for a job interview then absconded with company property\\n\\nEDIT: I think the job interview went well. I appreciate everyone’s encouragement, and also thank you for the silvers.\\n\\nI’m also happy (?) that so many other people have gone to work in various states of undress.\\n\\nAnd to the people who are/ are now afraid of coming to their work places ‘naked’: I’m sorry! This was also a latent fear of mine too, and the stuff of my nightmares. I can’t believe it actually happened and that ‘checking for pants’ will now become part of my routine. This is a story of a jail break that actually worked.... for a minute. This was years ago and I will not tell specifics and I will use fake names but this is the most epic FU I have ever heard of and it was me that FU. I was in the military but we were stateside. There was a group of fellow buddies with me. This was the night we all learned what a Jager Bomb Shot was. We had round after round after round after round. The night went by extremely fast and my friend Brian decided he would drive myself and my roommate home to our off base appointment. We left the bar and it was not long before we were pulled over. Turns out that a sedan having 3, 21 year olds leaving a bar at 2 am, near a military base is suspicious. The police officer knew we were all drunk when he got to Brian’s car window and we all admitted to it. The police officer gave Brian a breathalyzer test which he promptly failed. The office handcuffed Brian and put him in the back of the police car. The officer then asked myself and the other passenger, who again was my roommate, if we would like to take a breath test and see if we were below the legal limit to drive Brian’s car to our apartment so that it would not be towed and therefore would save Brian the impound charges. We took our breath tests and promptly failed. This is when things begin to get weird. \\n\\nThe officer left us with Brian’s car with the car keys also. The officer drove off with Brian to take him to the local jail for booking. To this day I don’t know why he left us with Brian’s keys. From the time the officer pulled us over it had been approximately 20 minutes. My roommate and I had an, “oh so bright”, idea.\\n\\n(Public Service Announcement: This is a good time to mention that this took place several years ago. At a time when DUI’s were only just beginning to become a serious offense and driving under the influence did not hold as serious a punishment as they do today. We were young and very stupid and I do not condone anyone driving under the influence of any mind altering substance. In fact, I am extremely happy that none of us hurt anyone that night and that I can talk about this obnoxiousness today. I do not take lightly the danger we put ourselves and others in that night.)\\n\\nThis idea was followed by several ideas that escalated very quickly. You see.... my roommate and I were Military Police Officers. We felt bad that we let our friend drive us home and he got into trouble. With an extreme lack of judgment and against all of our common sense we decided that we would drive Brian’s car back to our apartment. We didn’t have far to drive but this doesn’t excuse the absolute stupidity that we were acting upon. \\n\\nAt some point between the time we started driving Brian’s car and the time we arrived at our apartment, my roommate and I came up with a grand plan of how to get Brian out of jail. This was a multi staged plan and I will break it down:\\n1. Get Brian’s car back to our apartment.\\n2. Brush our teeth and put gum in. \\n3. Shave and get into our Military Police Uniforms.\\n4. Attach our guard belts to our waist so that we looked like we were on duty.\\n5. Call my precinct on base and inform the dispatch not to call the jail that Brian was at. (Every night my command would call every jail in the area to check for military members so that we could take custody of them) I knew who was working dispatch that night and that person just so happened to owe me a big favor. I made it clear that I would not explain why I was asking dispatch not to call this specific jail. Dispatch agreed not to call. \\n6. I called the jail Brian was at and told them that I was my command and that I was checking to see if any military members were in their jail. They stated “Yes” and stated Brian’s name. I asked if it would be okay if we come and take Brian into custody. They said “yes”. \\n7. Switch cars. Leave Brian’s car at our apartment and drive one of our own to the jail. \\n8. One last pep talk and walk out the door. \\nWe arrive at the jail and it’s around 4am and very quite, no other cars in the jail parking lot. We go to the jail entrance and ring a buzzer. A corrections officer speaks to us through an intercom system. I speak into the intercom while looking into a camera and I inform the corrections office that we are there to take custody of Brian. They said “okay”. \\n\\nIt took about 25 minutes before we heard anything further and as you could imagine we were scared out of our minds and it felt like an eternity! It felt like the exact fear you would feel if you were trying to break a friend out of jail! Then without warning a loud buzzer sound goes off. The large thick metal door in front of us slides open and on the other side we see two corrections officers.... and.... Brian in handcuffs. I’ve never personally see a ghost but at that moment I knew what a persons face would look like if they ever had seen one. Brian’s jaw dropped and his face went extremely flush, ghost white! I greeted the corrections officers and told them I will put my handcuffs on Brian so that they can have theirs back. Before doing so I turned Brian around and gave him a pat down. I swapped the handcuffs and.... that was it, I had Brian in custody!!! \\n\\nMy roommate and I thanked the corrections officers and we turn and walk away with our hearts beating out of our chest! We are walking across the parking lot to our vehicle when my roommate whispers to me, “don’t get in the car, don’t get in the car”. At that moment a police officer walks up behind us and looks us dead in the eyes then asks us, “arn’t you two the passengers of the vehicle I just pull over tonight?”. It was this moment that our hearts stopped and so did our breathing. \\n\\nLike I said, the parking lot was empty when we had arrived. No one inside or outside of the jail had caught on to us. It just so happens that the arresting officer arrived to the jail while we were in the sally port waiting for Brian to be released to us. The arresting officer was just sitting there doing paperwork in his patrol car in the jail parking lot as we walked Brian out of the jail and to our car. \\n\\nI’m sure you can guess what happened next. Yup, we all got put in jail. About 8am our command actually came and got us. We got back to base and they told me to go home and that they would call me when they needed me and to get my things in order because this was not going to go over well. I did just that and then arrived back at my command 24 hours later and I did not leave for 45 days and then we were deployed again so I never got off base again during that stateside stay. \\n\\nI was punished to the fullest extent of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), the military law. I was a disappointment to many people because of this FU. I felt ashamed and I took my punishment. All the while I was the most famous person at my command. I represented what it was to have your fellow military personnel’s back 100 percent! Everyone heard about this attempt to break Brian out of jail and we were practically celebrities. To this day I can not figure how in the hell I had the stupidity to try and pull this off! I am proud to say that this did not ruin my military carrier and that I did get to serve out my enlistment and be discharged honorably. Needless to say I have never FU this bad ever again in my life! The military absolutely did not condone this behavior but in some sort of way we were looked at as the most loyal friends a person could have. Our entire command had comradery like never before. It was crazy, insane, and stupid. However, like many other stories from my youthful years in the military, it’s funny to look back on and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to serve with my brother in arms. Even if we did FU some times. Like breaking someone out of jail.... for a minute. \\n\\nTL;DR: My buddy got a DUI, I was drinking with him and in the car when he got arrested, I was a military police officer. 2 hours later I broke him out of jail by impersonating an on duty MP (one of my many convictions). The officer that arrested my buddy recognized me in the jail parking lot after I had taken custody of my buddy. We both went to jail. I almost ruined my military carrier but now many years later I look back in awe of my stupidity and the time I tried to break a friend out of jail.  \\n\\nMy fiance and I have been eating Keto for the last 3 months. She recently bought these \"butter bombs\" that you put in your coffee/hot tea that adds fat to your diet. I saw half of one on the countertop and decided to give it a go because I hadn\\'t used one yet.\\n\\nI proceeded to make my tea that has cacao butter, coconut oil, hemp seed, and a bunch of other stuff in it but this time adding in that butter bomb. I threw it in the blender and glugged it down. I thought it was weird that it didn\\'t melt/blend/mix all the way but drank it none the less. It didn\\'t taste terrible but it made the drink a weird consistency.\\n\\nSmash cut to later in the evening when my fiance says to me as I\\'m watching TV, \"Hey have you seen the other half of the air freshener wax that was on the countertop?\" SMH. My fat ass thought it was food. I suppose I should go on amazon now and leave a review. 5 Stars, would eat again.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n TL;DR I ate air freshener wax thinking it was a keto \"fat bomb\" because I\\'m a fat ass. The original fuckup happend Friday last week but I only realized yesterday.\\n\\nObvious throwaway to not dox myself.\\n\\nBackground: I work in IT for a rather big school. We\\'re the only school for that education level in the whole state (happend in Europe but so you can better imagine the size of the school). As IT we have to do tasks from other areas too - including managing the system responsible for the speakers and announcements.\\n\\nSchool ended on June 19, they basically just opened the school to give the students the opportunity to say goodbye to each other. On the first week of summer break there where only a few teachers still there, preparing stuff for next year, organizing their stuff, cleaners and so on.\\n\\nIn the week of June 29 no body - really nobody - was there except me. Everyone either took vacation or \"worked\" from home. So last Friday I thought it would be funny to meddle a bit with the system for the announcements. What\\'s the funniest thing you could do over speakers? Right. Soviet Anthem. Funnies \\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* I\\'ve ever seen. Or so I thought. \\'50 indicates that the lesson has finished and students have a break and should go to the next class, \\'00 announces start of the next lesson. I replaced both with the soviet anthem, had a good chuckle and went home.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nYesterday I went in back again to upgrade a few servers and I was surprised to have lots of cars on the parking lots - including those with military number signs. As soon I entered the building the janitor saw me and then I learned that I massively fucked up. As my country had rising number of corona-cases again the government decided to put up a taskforce. To maintain social distancing of 2m (or 1.5m) they needed big rooms. Well, we have big auditoriums. And the military who also acts as civil defence (don\\'t know the word for it) was involved. Since people from all across the state came and had to help the local hospital and other tasks they decided that they have all meetings in the auditoriums. And the military can sleep in the empty classrooms (to reduce the number of people sharing one room). I mean it made sense, we even had many showers that are intended for emergencies next to the chemistry labs.\\n\\nThey got blasted with the soviet anthem twice per hour between 07:00 and 17:00. They didn\\'t liked it. The janitor tried to contact my boss at the beginning of the week but my boss cut him off before he could explain (\"something\\'s wrong with the speakers, \" \"I\\'m on vacation and nobody is at school, don\\'t annoy me!\").\\n\\nMany speakers got disconnected, they couldn\\'t disconnect those in the classrooms. I feel terrible for those who worked night shifts and had to endure while trying to sleep.\\n\\nI disabled it and apologized for the inconvenience. Everyone I saw was pretty annoyed.\\n\\nBoss will be back on Monday and I\\'ll have a lot of explaining to prepare.\\n\\ntl;dr: Replaced the school announcement system with the soviet anthem without knowing that state government and military will use the school during summer break.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks for the awards but please don\\'t give me awards. Not only is this a throwaway account , I would prefer it if you donate the equivalent amount of money (even if its just 5 bucks) to a local organization, either helping people who lost their job due corona, animal shelters and so on. Thanks. Actually happened on Saturday.\\n\\nWas in bed with my 38 week pregnant wife and we got down to business.\\n\\nI did all the usuals except going really gently etc.\\n\\nHad my wife in a comfortable position from behind.\\n\\nAfter I came I noticed my dick was drenched wet\\n\\nHuge smile on my face, I\\'ve made my wife squirt and shes not a squirter\\n\\nme \"OMG babe, I made you squirt for the first time ever, you always said you to do that. Maybe we should take it slowly more often. That sex was amazing\"\\n\\nit must be pointed out that I had the biggest shit eating grin imaginable (even though no ass was eaten)\\n\\nWife \"my waters just broke, get me to a fucking hospital straight away you fucking idiot\"\\n\\nBaby was born Sunday night, all healthy etc, wife wont stop calling me aquaman now though\\n\\nThanks for the Gold!!!!!!\\n\\nTL:DR - Thought I made my wife squirt during sex, instead her waters broke   \\n\\nSo obligatory this didn\\'t happen today but sometime around 5 years ago.\\n\\nI (19M) attended a high school about 20 minutes by car but having a younger sibling and both parents working more than full time, I had to get myself to school. The train was the easiest option, with no school buses running close to my place. The train was taken by students from many schools, who for some reason or another always seemed to be cooler than me and my mates, so I took every word they said as gospel. One day I was on the 20 min train ride home from school, and this guy was telling some (I now realise, likely bullshit) story of how he sprained his hand. He recounted to us younger lads how he was fingering some chick and she sneezed, supposedly contracting her whole body and getting his fingers stuck inside, now sprained. Now, being the horny af 14-year-old I was, I thought this was fuckin hot. I had discovered porn but for the most part liked to wank by myself and my own imagination. \\n\\nHere\\'s the problem. Being a 14-year-old, socially awkward Christian boy who went to an all-boys school, there was little in the way of imaginative content that came my way, so I latched onto this. Most days, for several months, this would be my imagined content for my night-time masturbation. In essence, when wanking, I thought of sneezing.\\n\\nOne day, I don\\'t even remember when, I STARTED sneezing. I had no idea why, not understanding the implications of what i was doing at all. Now, five years later, I still sneeze without fail, even when thinking of being horny and in turn, any sneeze I have turns me on. I bet any future wife of mine is in for a big surprise.\\n\\nTL;DR: wanked to a bullshit story about sneezing, now I sneeze when I\\'m horny and horny when I sneeze\\n\\nEdit: I thought I should add after the comments I\\'ve received that I genuinely had no idea about the genetic link, and so I spent 5 years convinced the above story was the cause of the sneeze. Thank you Reddit for your infinite wisdom, I no longer worry about the power of my own brain. This just happened about an hour ago. I was actually getting dressed and ready for working at home today. \\n\\nMy husband was working in our office and let me know he would be on a phone call. He also asked me to make him a smoothie before he had to leave to go into the office for a bit this morning.\\n\\nI was in the middle of fixing my hair, naked as I had just gotten out of the shower. But I knew he had a busy day and sometimes forgets to eat so i wanted to make sure he ate and was ready for his busy day. \\n\\nI go and make the smoothie, still naked as I\\'m in the middle of getting dressed! And bring it into him not realizing he was on a VIDEO conference call. \\n\\nI sat it down on his desk and he just turns to me with the most scared look on his face and pushes me away. I then realized I was butt ass naked on his camera in front of his CEO, my brother who also works with him, and a whole team from India. \\n\\nThey all saw, we will get shit for this for a while. I\\'m going to go crawl in a hole forever.\\n\\nTL;DR: I walked into my husband\\'s video conference naked and they all saw.\\n\\nEdit: when I say getting dressed, I mean getting ready. Just to clear up any confusion.\\n\\nEdit Pt II: everyone seemed to laugh it off, brother gave me shit, hubby is okay and laughing, all is well. Obligatory this didn\\'t happen today, but happened a while back.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo for Christmas, my wife got her and me matching coffee thermoses. Hers was copper tinted, mine was stainless steel. apart from that they were identical. I loved it! But after a while, being the absent minded person that I am, mine goes missing. \"No biggie\", I said to myself, \"My wife is staying home today, I\\'ll just take her thermos to work.\" So I fixed me up a nice thermos full of black coffee, and headed out the door to work.\\n\\nThis particular day was rather busy, and I had meetings back to back pretty much all morning. I had my thermos and laptop in tow, and was migrating from one conference room to another, when I realized I needed to run to the urination station. So I dropped off my laptop and thermos, ran and relieved myself, then stopped back by my cubical to pick up a couple of reports for the meeting.\\n\\nWhile sorting the papers at my desk, I reach over and grab for my thermos and take a big swig of coffee. Immediately, a few alarms and thoughts went through my head. \"This coffee got pretty cold pretty fast today...that\\'s odd. Also I don\\'t remember putting any cream or sugar in it this morning...that\\'s odd. Also what is this texture??\"\\n\\nAt this point, still mid-gulp, I shift my eyes down to the top of the thermos, which has a clear plastic lid, and I notice a very large floating blob of mold, which I had just taken a sizable chunk out of. Also I notice the thermos is stainless steel, not copper colored.This was my coffee that had been sitting on my computer desk, in plain sight, for a month. Oh no...I thought as I immediately reach for the trashcan to try and lurch the coffee back out, but to my disappointment it would not come back up. So I run to the bathroom and try a full on puking position to try and get it back up, again no luck. I just knew I was going to get deathly ill, but actually I didn\\'t get sick beyond the mental stress of having just consumed an entire family of slimy, chunky mold spores and rotten cream.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR: Took my thermos to work, forgot about it. Took my wife\\'s to work a few weeks later. Accidentally drank from my month old coffee and got a nice dose of penicillin and rotten cream.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit:  My apologies to anyone I made chunder this morning!\\n\\nEdit 2: For clarification - I just borrowed my wife\\'s thermos, filled it with fresh coffee, and took it to work. Hers wasn\\'t the moldy one. Mine was, as it had been setting at my desk for a month. I’ve been with him for roughly a month and I knew he spoke welsh fluently but I’ve never heard him, or anyone speak Welsh. \\n\\nWe are driving to his house and he’s on a call with one of his friends so I’m just sat on my phone, relaxing, enjoying the hills. Well, he suddenly starts speaking welsh and flinging his arms around, apparently having some sort of an argument. Ive never heard welsh before and tbh, it sounded more like lots of slurring. \\n\\nI legitimately thought he was having a stroke so I grabbed the steering wheel, he did the exact same thing but in the opposite direction, he out strengthed me, we span around on the road and came to a stop. \\n\\n\\nHe was so confused as to why I randomly grabbed the wheel. I explained the situation and now his welsh family and friends are having a great laugh at my mono-language self.\\n\\nTL;DR \\n\\nBoyfriend randomly started speaking in welsh, I thought he was having a stroke, I grabbed the steering wheel and we span out\\n\\n\\nEdit: I woke up to this have gained over 10k upvotes. Thanks for the love guys. I’ll do my best to answer your questions This actually did happen today and I\\'m still kind of shaken up from my initial reaction.\\n\\n\\nBasically me and my GF of almost 3 years now are in a long distance relationship due to us both being in college. We\\'re both from the same hometown so during summer we can see each other freely because we both come home to work. Long Distance is hard as fuck, so summer is a great time for us to fuck like Catholics to make up for the time we spent apart. Fortunately she\\'s on the pill so we don\\'t have to use condoms. Great right? Wrong.\\n\\n\\nLast night we were hanging out and were going to get busy, but she ended up getting a headache and as a result wasn\\'t in the mood. I went home with blue balls, and decided that I was tired too and just wanted to sleep it off. After going in and out of sleep, I eventually decided that I needed to get off, and ol\\' reliable would have to do.\\n\\n\\nI loaded up pornhub and started browsing through the videos until I found one of those casting tapes that looked good enough for me. I got the lotion ready and lathered up my meat scepter, but stopped to do a double take. The girl in the video looked like my girlfriend. Exactly like my girlfriend. I was thinking \"Oh cool this is basically like jerking off to moving nudes\", and began to jack it.\\n\\n\\nBut once the fucking started, my heart stopped. She had the same birthmark as my GF did, same spot below her ass, same shape and everything. This wasn\\'t a look alike, this WAS my girlfriend. I grabbed my earbuds to plug in, and sure enough, it was her voice speaking to the camera explaining how she was doing this because she needed money for college.\\n\\n\\nI checked below the video title and saw that it linked the actors/actresses and saw her screen name. I was hesitant, but clicked on it. Turns out this wasn\\'t a one time quick cash deal, because on my screen I was looking at page after page, video after video of my GF being railed by giant porn dicks. My girl wasn\\'t as innocent as I thought. She was a porn starlet.\\n\\n\\nI was so fucking torn right then. So many feelings started running through my brain. It now made sense why she suddenly decided to go on the pill last year without really having a reason. She was always complaining about money so this made sense why she would do it.\\n\\n\\nI then started freaking out about STDs. None of the videos had the guys using condoms and several were creampies. We were both each other\\'s firsts so once she was on the pill we ditched condoms because we knew neither of us had anything, but now I was terrified I had been duped. Not to mention we had been plowing like crazy over the past few months, so my worries were heightened because this was very much recent. I realized that it was late enough that I couldn\\'t do anything so I went to bed again.\\n\\n\\nI woke up the next morning in cold sweats. I was angry, pissed, and emotionally a wreck. I sent a text to my girlfriend calling her a slut and a liar and everything in the book I could think of. I called up my doctor\\'s office and scheduled an STD test. Fortunately they could take me right then so I drove over. \\n\\n\\nAfter the tests were finished, I got a text from my girlfriend. \"What the fuck are you talking about???\". I was even angrier than before. That little bitch was gonna act dumb about it?  I was furious, but I had evidence. She wasn\\'t gonna get out of this one without some explaining. \\n\\n\\nI fired up pornhub again to find the videos, but I couldn\\'t find the casting one I started on last night. No worries, I remember her stage name. I typed it into the search bar, again surprised by what I found. Not because I was looking at her being railed by other dudes again, but because the videos weren\\'t there. They didn\\'t exist.\\n\\n\\nNow I was just fucking confused. I tried other porn websites, but came up with the same results: nothing. I knew I saw them last night tho, so I knew they were there though, right?\\n\\n\\nAnd that\\'s when the realization hit. Remember how I said I was drifting in and out of sleep before getting up to jerk it? It was all a dream. A very bad dream. My brain decided that a great dream to have would be my Girlfriend being a pornstar, forcing me to watch her bang other dudes.\\n\\n\\nSo here I am explaining to my girlfriend like an idiot how I had a dream she was a pornstar without my knowledge, apologizing for all the names I called her, and sitting in awe at how badly this could\\'ve turned out. Fortunately she seems to be mostly understanding of this, so I think we\\'re good for now.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: Had a very realistic dream that my GF was doing porn, gave myself a heartache, sent her a very angry text over nothing, and wasted my morning in a Doctors office taking STD tests for diseases I don\\'t have.\\n\\n\\nEdit: OK Holy shit this blew up overnight. I can\\'t reply to most of the comments/questions/concerns so I\\'ll try to break it down by groups that I see most frequently commenting.\\n\\n\\nFor everyone saying the relationship is done: Surprisingly not. She took it pretty well and were talking this through pretty openly. I\\'m gonna go over later tonight in person just to make sure, but it hasn\\'t gone nearly as bad as I thought it would.\\n\\n\\nFor the conspiracy theorist: Nah, the videos don\\'t exist. She didn\\'t pull them or anything, there were enough videos that on a normal PH page there would definitely be at least one re upload. I checked my browser history, nothing there, and nothing is ever deleted on the internet, and I trust my GF so I\\'m fine on that note.\\n\\n\\nFor the \"YTA\" crowd: Yeah I know that\\'s why this is on TIFU and not on wholesome stuff or smthn.\\n\\n\\nFor the \"sex work is real work, you\\'re just misogynistic\" crowd: Sex work is a real job and I\\'m not contesting that. I also don\\'t care if my partners body count is as long as Troy Polamalu\\'s hair, or as short as OJ Simpsons prison sentence. What I got mad at was that she was CURRENTLY banging dudes without my knowledge, breaching my trust of her, and crossing a deal breaker for me. Obviously it never happened but that was what I was mad at, not anything else.\\n\\n\\nFor everyone getting mad at me for not knowing how porn STD tests work: thanks. Now I know I guess?\\n\\n\\nAlso shout-out to the one guy who thinks it\\'s fake solely bc he never heard of jacking off in bed before. Can\\'t find your comment but it gave me a good chuckle. Okay, I just want to start this by admiting something. I am a perv. So is my fiancée. It\\'s a pretty nice yin-yang thing except we\\'re both yangs. We make crass jokes fairly frequently, like to phone bone and are adamant memennials (it makes her cringe, had to write it).\\n\\nAnyway, we\\'ve been living apart for a while as we finish college. The last couple of months have been a little rough for us though. I have been hit by not one but two different hurricanes and have not had power or internet until today. On top of that, my program is all gas no brakes. I\\'ve had back to back, to back, exams and have had practically zero interaction with my fellow Yang.\\n\\nToday, I managed to finally gain access to the internet and was able to see her for the first time in what felt like forever. This was an exciting moment to say the least, and I wanted to make the most of it. But how would I do it? Yang didn\\'t know I had internet access yet, so I had a couple hours to ponder and prepare before nightfall. I turned off the lights, lit a few candles and placed them on my desk. Opened my laptop and tilted the screen to the optimal angle and began the call. She answered the phone excitidly, and I greeted Yang with wang while shouting **LAUGH** as I slapped my jimmy dean on the table, thus initiating our romantic rendezvous. Perfect execution. Delivered the package with more gusto than those FedEx drivers in the pornos. But here\\'s the fuck up. There was laughter. Too much laughter for one Yang and one wang.  It happened to be one of her friends birthdays and they were gathered around her phone to say hi. Her face was red, my boner was dead, and the call ended faster than my hopes of getting head.\\n\\nShe texted me after, freaking out. Telling me that we\\'ll talk later. I appologized because I figured she would be alone at the time. She said her friends won\\'t leave her alone now. I\\'m pretty sure they\\'re all drunk. Her friends keep sending me small dick memes.\\n\\n\\ntldr: Slapped dick on table for funny sexy time, got laughed at by her friends and am currently getting more small dick memes than a jockey private detective.\\n\\nUpdate: Holy shit guys...thought my alarm was going off...but no it’s just this post is blowing up at 4 in the morning! Thank you all for the awards and comments. It’s been a pleasure reading them and it is honestly just a great all around experience. But none of you care about thanks! I’m not as small brained as you might think. I know why you’re here. You have questions, I have answers.\\n\\n1. Let me hijack my own post real quick. The city of Lake Charles really got hit hard by these hurricanes. Pretty much the entire southwestern portion of the state suffered heavy damages. What has been shown in media isn’t comparable to what it has been like in person. So, please show some love to the area if you can!\\n\\n2. Yes, Jacksepticeye’s famous LAUGH meme was the inspiration behind my mating call. Maybe one day he’ll read this and think about my di...wonderful use of the English language.\\n\\n3. Her friends sobered up and stopped sending me memes. Honestly think they might have just ran out for the time being. Yang calmed down and laughed about it. She said that her friends were just busting my balls because got a full view of them. I was not nearly as amused.\\n\\n4. Lastly, as far as size goes, I will not confirm or deny anything. My fiancée and unfortunately now her friends will be the only ones privy to that info. So I’ll play the proverbial cocktease. But all good teases have to please at least a little. So, I’ll leave you with another silly rhyme. \\n\\nIs it big or is it little? Something huge or a tiny skittle? Long, hard, short...uhm...hard. Thicc like a tire or thin as a card? Honestly it doesn’t matter, work with what you have, and give them a good splatter.\\n\\nEdit: spelling For context, we live in a 8 storey flat on the 3rd floor.\\n\\nSo earlier this afternoon, I (16M) was minding my own business in my room on my phone. The past few days have been very hot where I live (around 30°C on average), so I left my window open and didn\\'t shut my door. My baby brother was playing with his toys in the hallway and didn\\'t seem to have a care in the world. My mum called me to prepare lunch since she was quite ill so I obliged.\\n\\nSo I was busy boiling the pasta and making the sauce when my gut instinct told me to just peek out to the hallway. I checked and he wasn\\'t there. *Probably watching TV or something*, I thought and I didn\\'t think much of it. I was about to return to my duty when I froze in my tracks.\\n\\nYou ever get that sick feeling that twists your guts so hard you know FOR A FACT something so horrible and catastrophic is about to happen? In an instant, I found myself teleporting right outside my room and there he was by the window. He somehow used my bed to climb onto the heater and sit down near the edge of the window.\\n\\nThe upper half of his body was dangling out and he was busy throwing his toys and being fascinated at how far they can fall and break. He was THIS close to falling to his death, crushing all of his fragile bones.\\n\\nWithout thinking, I quickly grabbed him and put him out of harm\\'s way and I started hugging him tight while cursing myself repeatedly. My mum was oblivious to what was going on the entire time. I shut the window, closed my room and sat him down with me while I resumed making lunch. I was in shock.\\n\\nMy brother could\\'ve died today. All because of one stupid mistake I\\'ve made. Even though I\\'ve saved him, I still feel sick and disgusted at myself and this whole incident is playing on loop in my mind currently.\\n\\n\\n\\n**TL;DR: Made a huge mistake leaving my window open when I was asked to make lunch, brother somehow got to the window and nearly fell out.**\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n***EDIT: I\\'ve just woken up around 30 minutes ago and checked my Reddit. My inbox is SWARMED with supportful and encouraging messages and it\\'s a struggle to answer everyone! Didn\\'t expect it to get this much attention, tbh. I\\'m doing my best to read through everyone\\'s comments and answering accordingly. Thank you so much!! ❤ (also here\\'s an [image](https://images.app.goo.gl/Z8DHGwPk6mv3YUiT8) of how the windows in my house look like, incase you were wondering NOT MY WINDOW)*** So, I went in for a routine lady checkup right. These visits are awkward from start to finish... The hype yourself up to be able to leave the house, the play-it-cool conversation before taking your pants off.. and oh god, the cleaning beforehand. Pretty sure I\\'ve discovered a new layer of skin from all the scrubbing. Pubic hair? What is that. \\n\\nSo, enter the doc\\'s office. Awkward prelims, tick. Pants off, tick. On the table (please tell me this piece of disposable paper has been changed since the last patient) MY ASS IS VULNERABLE RIGHT NOW\\n\\nFast forward to the speculum *shivers* now it\\'s just silence. Silence and this guy, just having a stare off with my lady taco. After a few horrifying silent seconds, I decide it would be a good idea to make small talk. (only god knows why) Clearly out of creative ideas, I blurted \"a lot of cobwebs up there\" \\n\\nThe doc stops moving and chuckles awkwardly.. after what feels like an eternity he says, \"not having an active sex life then?\" \\n\\nAWESOME. NO. I MEANT THE CEILING!!! YOUR CEILING. NOT MY VAGINA. *Crawls into a hole and dies*\\n\\nFor some reason he thought this was way funnier then I did. So yep. Should I change gynaecologists, can\\'t bear to \\'face\\' him again.  😅😅\\n\\nEdit: obviously I can understand he was just being a professional and was concentrating on his job. That\\'s why it\\'s a time that  *I*  fucked up. 😂\\n\\nEdit 2: thank you for silver/gold kind strangers!!\\n\\nEdit 3: oh good lordy my inbox. The state of my \"ceiling\" is fine, thanks for your concern 🙏 also yes, I told him he misunderstood me and we laughed about it. Also, you guys are the best. \\n\\nTL;DR told my gynaecologist he needs to clean his ceiling more often, but actually it was his mind that needed cleaning. 😉 TIFU ... with the obligatory this happened a few years ago but I still experience the gut wrenching feeling of sticking my foot in my mouth every time I think of it. \\n\\nSo I used to be a wedding photographer and sometimes people get married at the courthouse then have a friends and family reception at a later date. So they are technically married when I first meet them. \\n\\nOne day... I\\'m having a consultation, they bring a child, maybe 8 years old, and we put him in front of the office tv while we talk. Again not uncommon for courthouse marriage couples to already have kids together.\\n\\nThe meeting goes well and they write me a deposit check. The check has both their names on it and the last names are the same. \\n\\nMy brain does maths and I figure... Joint checking account + same last name + kid in tow = they are already married so I say...\"You two are prepared, you already have new checks printed with the same last name.\" To which the bride to be replies... \"I\\'m kinda still married to his brother.\" And she ended that story with \"...most of his family doesn\\'t approve.\"\\n\\nI was mortified and tongue tied not knowing what to say next as we continued to plan a wedding between this little boys Mom and his new \"Uncle Dad\" as he watched cartoons in front of my TV.  \\n\\nTL;DR ask couple if they were married as they hired me to be their wedding photographer and the answer was no, she had the same last name because she was still married to his brother.\\n\\nEdited to fix a typo. Obligatory this happened a few weeks ago.\\n\\nMy husband and I have been together for 13 years. I have no idea how this started really, but I\\'ve been powdering and rubbing his balls for years now. It is just something that we do. It\\'s weirdly comforting and puts us both to sleep. Plus, who doesn\\'t like freshly powdered balls instead of gross swamp balls? Not to mention the wonders it does for chafing.\\n\\nAnyway, one day I can\\'t find the powder for our 2 yr old\\'s butt. No biggie. I go to the store to get more, but I figured I could get Man powder too. A nice smelling one that just smells like... Man. NOT the after work gross man smell... this is what we are trying to get rid of my dudes. So I get a new powder for him and just regular ol\\' Johnson\\'s for the baby. It\\'ll be a nice surprise for when he comes home since he\\'s been working out of town.\\n\\nHere\\'s my fuck up...\\n\\nI DID NOT READ THE LABEL PROPERLY. I saw that it said \"Absorbing. Cooling. Refreshing.\" I saw that it said \"...odor + wetness control...\" and just thought of how awesome it would be for him to not have swamp balls. Being a bit of an airhead, it did not occur to me to read further into that.\\n\\nSo fast forward a few days later to when husband finally comes home from working out of town. Night rolls around and we\\'re in bed. My husband asks for Powder and Ball Rubs. After a full week, without his wife to powder his balls for him, I say \"no prob. I got you, boo.\" I bust out the new Men\\'s Essentials Man Powder. It smells good. I dig it. I turn around to put it away and he asks me what I put on him. I turn back to him and can see he\\'s clearly uncomfortable. I look at the label and see that the cooling effect comes from menthol. Now, I feel awful at this point, but honestly, I can\\'t stop laughing. He\\'s complaining its like IcyHot so I tell him to take a shower and see if that works. He hops in the shower and washes his balls. Nope. He is still feeling it. I\\'m still laughing at my poor husbands predicament that I created by trying to buy him something new for his balls. I ended up using the Johnson\\'s on him, but he was still uncomfortable. I felt pretty bad about it, despite laughing like a hyena the entire time.\\n\\nThat night he said I should post this here, but I wanted to surprise him so I\\'ve waited. I do still powder his balls when he\\'s home. I am going to stick with Johnson\\'s Baby Powder though.\\n\\nBabe, if you are reading this, I am very sorry for causing your balls discomfort, but it was so damn funny. I love you. Sorry for being an airhead some times.\\n\\nTL;DR TIFU by powdering my husband\\'s balls with powder that made him feel like he had IcyHot on his balls.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUpdate: First of all, those of you who awarded my weird and wholesome post are the real MVPs here. I humbly thank you. When I made this post, I had no idea it would blow up like this. Made my day reading most of these comments, but then again the comments are usually where its at. Some of you really need to broaden your horizons and just caress those balls because they need love too. My husband does manual labor so yes he gets shweddy balls. He showers and asks for powder. I have had his penis in me, had his children, I really don\\'t think touching his balls is that far out there. And you all have opened my eyes and educated me on the dangers of talcum powders. I have been looking at new things to try instead of J&J Baby Powder. I thank you for that and I\\'m sure my husband\\'s balls will too.  Obligatory this happened last night. Also obligatory, I’m an adult male, and I’m 100% sure this was an accident. TLDR at the bottom. \\n\\nSo I’m taking online piano lessons with a teacher that I’m well acquainted with. They’ve been going smoothly. I’m already used to zoom because I finished my semester of school on it anyway, and I figured this would be a good time to reunite with my instrument. \\n\\nwe switched up the times for the recurring lessons a week ago, and that caused some confusion as to when last night’s lesson was to begin. He sends me a zoom link and a text at around 5pm and I thought the lesson wasn’t until 5:30pm, so instead of texting him, since I was sitting there giving all of my assignments a final practice run through anyway, I just clicked on the invite link and opened zoom to ask if it would be okay to wait thirty minutes. He says it’s fine, so I leave the meeting and close out of zoom. \\n\\nI spend the next twenty-five or so minutes practicing, and decide, “eh, close enough,” and open the email with the same link again. What’s the harm in being a few minutes early? \\n\\nThis is where the fuck up happens. \\n\\nI figured he’d have closed out of zoom as well, but apparently, he’d just left the meeting running, but had forgotten about it. He must have been viewing another window. But his webcam didn’t know the difference, of course. And as soon as I connect, I’m greeted with a spectacle I can’t immediately make sense of. \\n\\nHe’s standing up in front of his computer, the camera cutting him off right above the neck, and right below the waist, so all I can really see is his torso, but his hand is below the camera, and he appears to be...jerking it? My mind does a bit of an acrobatic feat for a moment. He knew I was logging back on within the next couple minutes. Maybe he’s just Fucking with me. \\n\\nSo I say “hey, man!” And he doesn’t respond. His hand just keeps going just below the cutoff of my view (thank god), but that’s when I notice, just at the bottom of the camera, where his shirt ends, it’s just skin. And the control panel at the bottom of the screen isn’t so much cutting off the action as it’s merely blurring it, and it’s all skin color. He didn’t reply to me, so my audio must be going through headphones he’s not wearing, and if he doesn’t have zoom open at the moment, he has no way of knowing I even signed on. So I just leave the meeting. \\n\\nI sit there in silence with my jaw dropped for a moment, wondering what I should do. I paid for this lesson. I want to keep taking them. Is this even a big deal? Can I just... get over it? Make like it never happened? Should I even tell him? \\n\\nA minute later, my phone buzzes. He’s texting me that I can go ahead and join the meeting again via the same link. Oh, don’t I know it. So, I hold my breath, and click the link again half expecting to be faced with another display of masturbation, but no. He’s just sitting there with pants on ready to begin the lesson. \\n\\nSo I put it out of my mind, had a very productive lesson (though the thought reoccured to me a few times), and as soon as we are logged off, I VERY carefully turn everything off, and burst out laughing. I saved this laughter up the whole time. I couldn’t stop laughing for five solid minutes. \\n\\nI couldn’t decide if I should tell him or not, but no. I think not. To me, it’s just funny. Really funny. I can handle the hilarity, but if I were him, my humiliation would be beyond reckoning.\\n\\nTLDR; rejoined a zoom meeting a few minutes early and caught my music teacher jerking off. My boyfriend and i have been having some issues...enter dead bedrooms sub here. After a trip to his doctor, he was put on testosterone. I heard about this before and asked him if he could get the cream, because I knew this would be something he could easily take care of himself. He was told it was not as effective and was put on the kind that has to be injected with a rather large needle. He came home with a stash of the stuff. I work in the car business and have never given a shot in my life and even get light headed when getting them. Furthermore, I’m the type of girl that can mess up a one car parade- so to say I was hesitant and nervous to take this on is an understatement. He woke me up early this morning for his shot, and feeling drowsy and nervous I give the shot- needle goes in and  I hear a little suction noise and no needle comes out!  Holy f^ck! In shock, i tell him his body (right butt area) sucked the needle into it!  He went white as a sheet- We are both freaking as I’m frantically throwing clothes on telling him he’s going to have to stand upright through the sunroof on the way to the ER (since there is a 2 inch needle in his arse that would surely prevent any bending) my mind was racing with worrying that the needle would get sucked into his heart- after the crying and screaming subsides- standing over the sink, poised to yack he’s looking down at the packs of needles and reads on one of the packets that the needle is retractable and the noise was the needle going into the handle. 😣😱🤯 \\nTL;DR convinced I broke a needle off in my boyfriends butt. So my wife comes home after picking our two youngest kids up from school. She opens the door and goes, “Did you say something about Santa Clause stealing penises?”\\n\\nI reply, “I didn’t say any shit like that. I would NEVER ruin Christmas.”\\n\\nHere’s how we got there:\\n\\nI have two daughters and a son. My son was 3 or 4 at the time. He refused to wear clothes and ran around naked or in his underwear. My daughters weren’t having any of it and were like, “This is your department, old man. Do something.”\\n\\nI tried to reason with my son and that just didn’t work. I was thinking that I needed something to use that he was afraid to lose. He’s a tiny kid. He’ll play with a cardboard box and be happy. \\n\\nThat’s when he came running past me with both hands on his junk. That’s it. He loves his dick. I love MY dick. Me and my penis are tight. \\n\\nSo my son and youngest daughter are eating lunch. I look across the table and go, “Hey big guy, you know how sometimes you can’t go to sleep cause you think there’s something in your closet?”\\n\\nHesitantly, “... yes.”\\n\\n“I didn’t want to scare you but you’re old enough to know now.”\\n\\nHis eyes got wide and my daughter had a puzzled look on her face. She’s 4 years older. \\n\\nI go, “There’s a goblin that lives in your closet. And if you don’t do what you’re supposed to, like wear underwear and clothes, he creeps out at night while you’re asleep and steals your penis.”\\n\\nHe incredulously responds, “NAH AH.”\\n\\nI reassure, “Oh yeah. What do you think happened to your mom and sisters?”\\n\\nAt this point my youngest daughter loses her mind laughing. She’s holding her sides and almost falls out of her seat. \\n\\nMy son was dead silent. I could almost hear him thinking, “Damn... they don’t have dicks.”\\n\\nSo where does Santa Clause come in?\\n\\nAfter I told my wife I would never ruin Christmas, she tells me she heard our son say to our daughter, “You must have done something really bad for Santa Clause to steal you penis.”\\n\\nMy guy confused Goblins with Santa somehow and thought Santa Clause was roaming around with a big red sack full of stolen dicks. \\n\\nFear not. I straightened him out. I googled pics of Santa and pics of goblins from the movie Labyrinth. \\n\\nTLDR: Tried to scare my son into wearing under wear and he ended up thinking Santa Clause was stealing dicks.\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/ViftZTfRSt8 This happened last night. Put a tampon in around 6pm and went about my evening activities. I had a busy night, but at the end of the night I got to see my boyfriend. Totally forgot about the tampon and we had sex. I have a pretty light flow/low key periods due to an IUD, so between that and my busy day I totally forgot I had a tampon in. \\n\\nWe wake up this morning and I remember. My stomach drops. I immediately go to the bathroom and I can\\'t feel it. Its gone. I tried switching positions, squatting, had my boyfriend try, everything I could think of. Nothing. After close to a half hour of trying, hoping, and praying to the Vagina Gods, I accept my fate. This shit is GONE. \\n\\nAt this point I\\'m worried that I\\'m never finding this thing and it\\'s going to be stuck inside of me forever. I also know the risk of contracting TSS if I keep it in much longer so I know I need to get it taken care of sooner rather than later. After class I\\'m off to our Student Health Center. I go to a small college, so the doctor is only in for an hour a day. I strategically timed it so that I WOULDN\\'T see the doctor-- he teaches one of my classes, Gen Med, at night once a week. I wasn\\'t keen on having my professor dig through my vagina to find a lost tampon, so I was hoping the nurse could do it. \\n\\nNurse is very nice and reassuring but says I have to wait for the doctor. Great. Some time later I\\'m in a gown, in the stirrups, waiting for my professor to come in, just full of dread. He comes in and is super friendly because he knows me from class, which is the last thing I wanted. Really wish he would have just stayed silent at this point and pretended that he didn\\'t know me. \\n\\nHe starts the vaginal exam and the following exchange occurs:\\nDr, to the nurse: \"well, she got some pretty good news last night\"\\nMe: \".........\"\\nDr: \"Theres no final in Gen Med!\"\\nMe: \"..oh\"\\n\\nI for real thought he was commenting that the sex was good. Don\\'t get me wrong, it was, but that was even more mortifying than being in the stirrups, naked from the waist down, having my professor look at my vagina. \\n\\nHe finds the tampon after 5 long, agonizing minutes of searching. I have his class in a few days. Not sure how I\\'m going to look at him. I\\'m a 4.0 student and I\\'ve never felt more stupid in my entire life. \\n\\nTL;DR: forgot I had a tampon in and had sex, losing the tampon. Had to go to the health center to get it removed by my professor, who is also the campus physician. \\n\\nEdit: i was dumb enough to say \"stupider\" instead of more stupid, as many of you have pointed out. Its been a long day, ya\\'ll. \\n \\nEdit 2: turns out \"stupider\" was fine. Lesson learned: those terms are interchangeable, trust your gut. Also, take your tampon out before sex. \\n\\nEdit 3: wow, I didnt really expect this post to blow up like it did. Thanks for making a story about my vagina make the front page, guys. \\nFor those of you asking, it ended up near my cervix. It was too small/deep for me to have much success getting it myself, because when you lean forward to do a self-exam, the vaginal canal tightens. \\nThanks for the supportive messages, I didn\\'t realize this was such a common problem. Makes me feel a lot better, lol.  It wasn’t today it was a while ago when you could have parties. I was throwing a party at my house. Not even a party. A small gathering of maybe 10-15 people. Everyone was having a good time and I was ranting, loudly, to my friend about how so many guys had struggled to take my bra off. I don’t have huge breasts. I wear a standard 2 clasp bra so I was annoyed when guys fumbled around with it. Sometimes they couldn’t even get it off and I had to take it off. Then I decided I needed to try it myself so I yelled “John come here. Let me put a bra on you so I can take it off and see how hard it is”. I ran upstairs to get one of my nicer bras that I usually wear on dates and put it on him. I struggled for a while and then realized it was a lot harder than it seems especially since I’m doing it at a different angle. I had to eat crow and now I’m fully impressed when a guy can get my bra off with one hand, or even at all. And don’t mind when guys can’t get it off and I have to do it myself because that shit is hard af.\\n\\nTL:DR- bitched about guys not being able to take my bra off. Put my bra on someone to show how easy it was to get off and failed to do it \\nAs the title clearly states, I left my portable pink bedazzled vibrator on the ledge of the bathtub. \\n\\nHours go by, I’d forgotten all about it. \\n\\nThen it happened. \\n\\n**KNOCK KNOCK**\\n\\nMy bedroom door opens and my 10yo daughter is standing there holding my little ol buzzy buddy in her hands stating that my 12yo stepdaughter had found it when she decided to use my bathroom for her bath. \\n\\nMy Kid: “She said it was some weird massager thing”\\n\\nMe: “Yep, it is! Thanks for returning it!”\\n\\n[my kid awkwardly walks away leaving door open]\\n\\nMy SO: “Babe, you must be embarrassed! That’s so embarrassing!”\\n\\nMe: “SHUT YOUR GODDAMN WHORE MOUTH, IM POSITIVELY MORTIFIED”\\n\\nStepdaughter: Walks past our bedroom at the speed of a fucking disabled sloth with a devious grin on her face. \\n\\nShe locks eyes with me. Proceeds to wave and walk past the door without ever losing eye contact. \\n\\nStepdaughter has done this now 4 times. \\n\\nI’ve been informed she sent a photo of it to her BFF to identify what it was. *They know.* \\n\\nI’m packing my bags and moving to the fucking moon.\\n\\nTL;DR left vibrator in bathroom. Kid found. Kid returned. Kid is now silently judging me. I’m moving off planet. I\\'m preparing to graduate college, and as such, have spent hours and hours honing my resume before applying to my dream jobs. While working on the process, I\\'ve sent my resume to several friends to proof and critique it, which can get dull. So to give them a bit a of a laugh, and being the immature college boy I am, decided to add a line about offering frequent handjobs to my employer under the skills line. Obviously to be removed in the final copy. Well my friend got busy and didn\\'t get around to the proof read for about a week, finally read it and told me it looked good. Well I forgot about the joke and immediately started applying to jobs with it... Needless to say I don\\'t think I\\'ll be getting interviews. Or maybe just not the kind of interviews I want? And if you\\'re reading this; Boeing, Lockheed, and a few other companies, I\\'m sorry and I will not be offering handjobs to my employer.\\nTL;DR I forgot to delete a handjob joke on my resume before applying to my dream job. Always proof read your resumes, kids tldr at the bottom\\n\\n17 years ago I passed my driver\\'s test and wanted to take the family car out on my own. Being a huge nerd I checked the glove compartment for the insurance and registration info which is when I found a baggie full of weed and a small wooden pipe. I just kinda sat there for a minute, grabbed it and went back in the house and found my dad. I handed it to him, said I didn\\'t care who it belonged to but if I ever got pulled over, the cops probably weren\\'t going to believe the 16 year old girl that it wasn\\'t hers. He just put the stuff in his pocket, kinda shrugged and said, \"it\\'s your mom\\'s for her glaucoma\". Whatever, fine, just don\\'t keep it in the car anymore.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI was at a family a dinner awhile ago and I can\\'t remember what someone said but I replied with, \"yeah, because mom has glaucoma\" and my mom goes, \"I don\\'t have glaucoma\" and I, incredulously, said \"dad said you had glaucoma\", in which my dad responds to with, \"what the hell are you talking about, I never said that\". After reminding him of said driving incident over a decade ago he just looks at me and burst out laughing, said he had no memory of that at all and couldn\\'t believe I believed his off the cuff lie about my mom having a degenerative eye disease. I told them I had been writing down family history of glaucoma at every doctor and eye visit I\\'d been on for the past like 15 years. They just laughed harder.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\ntldr: I found my parent\\'s weed stash when I was 16, they told me it was for glaucoma, I believed them for almost 2 decades.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: this was my first post, thank you so much for the flair!\\n\\nEdit 2: sorry for those saying this is made up but I really was (am) just a huge nerd/goody two-shoes and was terrified of getting in trouble. Yes my parents were cooler than me and still are and no I didn\\'t appreciate that until I was much older\\n\\nEdit 3: the only time I remember a doctor/optometrist ever really commenting on it was when I went to have Lasik when I was like 26/27 and they said they did a more in-depth exam before approving me for the surgery This did not happen today... this was a fuck up. I have told no one of this before.\\n\\nI used to work for a very large logistics company as a supervisor out on one of their flight ramps. I was there for years, and I had asserted myself as an essential employee after some managers changed hands and things almost went belly up for a lot of us. When things settled I became a catch-all assistant for the new manager, and I would do a little bit of everything, mostly on my own discretion. I have to say that because a lot of this story may just seem like me wandering around an active flight ramp for no reason. If you assume that, you are right, but the important thing is that not only did my boss think I was working but he also thought I was doing it very well.\\n\\nI was doing neither.\\n\\nSo on one chilly spring night, I was on a flight ramp dock checking the empty containers that get loaded with freight and put onto the planes. This consists of spotting a can, opening several spring locks, checking inside, closing the can, and marking it as empty on a little scanner. Anyway, it\\'s menial work, and the night is slow.\\n\\nI spend hours alternating between checking cans and abandoning my job to talk to coworkers or mess around with something completely unproductive. In the middle of doing the latter, I get a call to help out on a plane going to Hong Kong. I zip over there, help out the new supervisor, talk to some pilots, and head back to my cans.\\n\\nAt this point, its like six in the morning, and I am exhausted. I\\'m shuffling through a boredom induced coma when I find a can positioned in the corner of the dock with its door wide open. I wander around to close it when I realize two employees are just boning down inside, and it\\'s not pretty either. It\\'s mean, third-shift, need to buy more cigarettes, don\\'t look me in the eyes kind of sex. They seriously look like they are trying to hurt each other, but the roaring of the nearby jet engines swallowed up any noise them or I had been making much like how she appeared to be swallowing most of his hand.\\n\\nI think it\\'s pretty funny, and seeing as my shift was just about to be over, I don\\'t even bother considering to report it. I know both of them are college students who really need the work. So, I decide to play a little harmless prank on them just to teach a lesson and help them avoid any trouble: I shut and lock the can.\\n\\nSee, these cans have spring locks that operate from the outside. The only things really supposed to be in those cans are packages, and it\\'s not like the packages need a way to get out from the inside. I figured eventually they would start banging on the can (or each other again), and someone would come by to help them out.\\n\\nThat, my friends, is not how the story ends.\\n\\nInstead, as I am just about to badge out for the day, I get an urgent call on my phone. Usually correspondence is made on the radio\\'s exclusively; so a call on the phone is really serious. I wasn\\'t given any details other than get back to the Hong Kong flight immediately. I just figured the supervisor on the flight was having a newbie freak out or something. It wasn\\'t uncommon to see new supes crack, but when I get there, she is cracking up. Like, she is laughing so hard someone is having to hold her up.\\n\\nTurns out, she was just finishing up the plane when she got directions to put some empty cans on the plane from a nearby dock. There are hundreds, maybe even thousands of cans she could have pulled, but somehow against all odds one of the containers she grabs mysteriously has two fornicating freshmen inside who didn\\'t bother to start calling for help until *after they were locked inside the fuselage of a 747!*\\n\\nThe new supervisor is so clueless as to how to handle almost shipping two humans to Hong Kong that she was just relieved for the day, leaving me to clean up the whole mess. Oh, and not just a figurative mess. Yup, I spent nearly four extra hours on overtime having to write an incident report, finish the plane, and literally help the hazmat team mop up semen.\\n\\nTL;DR I watch people have sex before trying to ship them to Hong Kong but wind up spending my morning cleaning up post-coital juices for overtime money.\\n\\nEdit: Spelling\\n\\nEdit 2: Yo, I figured this didn’t need to be said, but some people seem to be a little confused. This is TIFU. I fucked up, and I absolutely don’t condone this. And for the people that said, “They could have gotten hurt.” You’re right, which is why it’s a fuck up. For all the folks who are indignant that this is unsafe, yup, everyone gets that. This happened yesterday. \\n\\nMy husband and I have 5 kids. He works a lot and I stay home with the kids. Our ideal sexy times are at different times of the day (his night, mine afternoon). Because of all of this we don\\'t have sex all that often (something we\\'re both okay with). \\n\\nYesterday was a fairly lazy sunday and we were able to sneak upstairs for a bit after lunch. We were just laying in the bed talking and one thing led to another..and since I am extra frisky during that time of day, we really got into it. I usually try to be quiet (small house, lots of kids) but I was in the MOMENT and I have no idea what sounds may have come out of our room.\\n\\nFast forward to us getting dressed and ready to go back downstairs, I check my phone and have 2 missed calls from my oldest daughter (13), a voicemail and texts saying \"Are you okay??\" 💁\\u200d♀️🤦\\u200d♀️ Obviously I was a bit louder than I thought. She wouldn\\'t make eye contact with me for hours after and Idk how to feel haha\\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\nI had sex with my husband with all of the kids home, was not so quiet and got worried calls and texts from my kid asking if I was okay. So last week I was in Korea and spontaneously decided to download Tinder a day before I was supposed to leave since I had no plans that day. Luckily I found a guy who was willing to meet up with me that day and we planned to meet for dinner in Seoul.\\n\\nThen he told me he actually had plans at night but was willing to meet up for coffee. I agreed and we end up meeting a few hours later to grab a coffee. He pays for my drink and immediately we connect and talk for a very long time. He was super sweet and very attentive throughout the whole date. I was surprised that we shared many similar interests. He promised that when I visit Korea again, he\\'d show me around and made tentative plans. He repeatedly told me he wanted to meet again, which I took as a sign of interest. Since I was returning to Japan, I had no intention of continuing to use Tinder, so I asked for another way to contact him. Since we were in Korea, I figured he would have Kakao Talk (a Korean messaging app), so I suggested that I should add him on Kakao. **First big fuckup.** I added him on Kakao through his QR code, despite never using the app before. Then send a quick \"hi\" message and close the app. After that, I forgot about it and we quickly went back to chatting and banter.\\n\\nEventually, it came around time for dinner, but neither of us wanted to leave early, and since he had his commitment at 9:00 pm, he suggested we walk around and grab dinner. I agreed and we walked around the streets of Seoul to find a place to eat. We settled for street food and talked over dinner. This time, I paid for the meal, as a thank you for the coffee, and we head back to the station. But since neither of us wanted to depart, we made one last pitstop, and he decided to show me a Korean bookstore. We were supposed to end the date at 7:00 pm, but we kept on pushing it back as we found new things to discuss, until it reached almost 7:30. It was finally time to go, so we walked to the station together. He told me that he was very lucky to have met me and that I should call him when I reached my hotel safely. We agreed to keep in touch online.\\n\\nWe depart and I get on the train. My hotel was 1 hour and 30 minutes away by train, so 45 minutes in, I decided to spontaneously delete tinder. Since I had this guy on Kakao, it shouldn\\'t have been a problem to delete Tinder right? **Second fuckup**. When I finally reached my hotel around 9 pm, I decided to open up Kakao Talk and message him. I look at our chat log and it was empty. I remember thinking \"*weird, I thought I messaged hi earlier\"*, but I quickly dismissed it and tried to send another message. It didn\\'t go through. So I tested another message, and it didn\\'t work. Turns out, I\\'m partially banned from Kakao Talk because the number I registered with isn\\'t associated with a carrier anymore. This means I can\\'t send messages unless they send the first message. I quickly go into panic mode and try to contact him through other means. However, I deleted my Tinder account, which was my main way of contacting him.\\n\\nSo I thought that maybe I should make another Kakao Account with my Korean number and contact him through there. So I uninstall and reinstall Kakao Talk and create a new account. **Third Fuckup**. Clearly I wasn\\'t thinking, because there was no way to re-add him since I don\\'t have his Kakao ID. So I backtrack and tried to log in to my old Kakao Account and just wait for him to message me first. Immediately, I receive a popup notification *\"This account is temporarily disabled\"*. I thought the ban only extended to messaging, but apparently, now I can\\'t log in either. I messaged Kakao Support, and they said it would take several weeks to unban me if they don\\'t find anything wrong.\\n\\nGreat, so now I guess I unwillingly ghosted my first date. I really put in the effort to contact him again by trying to find other social media, but to my avail, I had no luck. So I guess I will never be able to contact him again, and the whole date was just one big fever dream of my time in Korea.\\n\\n**TL;DR** : Went on an awesome first date with a guy from Tinder while I was traveling in Korea. We had an immediate connection. I added him on a messaging service and prematurely deleted Tinder since I didn\\'t want to use Tinder when I returned to Japan. I found out I was partially banned from that messaging service and locked myself out of my account. So there was no way to contact him again. Therefore, I unwillingly ghosted a guy I had great chemistry with.\\n\\n**TL;DR 2** Can’t contact guy I went on a great first date with because I deleted tinder and messaging app doesn’t work.\\n\\nEdit: clarifications. I deleted my Tinder *account*, I tried recreating an account, but he’s not there. I can’t rematch with him because I’m back in Japan now and I’m too far. He doesn’t have fb or instagram, I tried. And I don’t have a phone number (to save money while abroad in Japan), so I never asked for his.\\n\\nEdit 2: Okay I contacted Tinder Support\\n\\nEdit 3: Thank you to all the kind strangers offering to pay for a tinder gold subscription, but I will try to exhaust all my free options first. Plus I would feel bad accepting that kind of aid!\\n\\nEdit 4: Tinder Support\\'s response: *\" After deleting your account, your account can\\'t be restored but you can create a new account just by logging into Tinder again.* *If you\\'ve deleted your account, you won\\'t be able to get your matches and messages back*.*\"* :(\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUpdate: [Found Him! (TIFUpdate)](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/e6sgxk/tifupdate_by_accidentally_ghosting_great_first/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) Ok, so yeah, it\\'s messed up. This happened years ago. So, here\\'s the deets. \\n\\nA few years ago I met a bisexual dude who was around 25 years older than me. I was 23 at the time. We met through an app similar to Grindr. We meet up, hook up, end of it. Never met again. Around 2 weeks or so later I start dating this 20 year old girl. Things are going ok and about 3 weeks in the relationship we are walking through a park when she stops me and tells me that her dad is there and I should meet him. It\\'s a bit soon, sure, but it\\'s not like formal or anything so I agree. Lo and behold though, her daddy is the dude that was calling me daddy a few weeks back. We both freeze and stare at each other in absolute horror not knowing what to say. We awkwardly shake hands, girl attributes it to nervousness. 2 weeks go by and one day she calls me to meet up. When I get there she is absolutely fuming. Like, I can literally see smoke coming out. She goes off on me about how could I possibly do this to her. I obviously have zero clue what she is on about. She tells me that her dad came clean to her and her mom about being bisexual and told his daughter, my gf, to break up with me so he can be with me. And apparently it was my fault because I was the one that turned him gay. So she throws a plastic container at me and storms off. Never heard from any of them again.\\n\\nTL : DR I meet up with a bisexual dude for an one off, start unknowingly dating his daughter, dude comes out to his family, gf blames me for turning him gay, breaks up with me\\n\\nEdit 1 : seriously thanks for the awards guys. Never thought I\\'d get awards on here.\\n\\nEdit 2 : in case it wasn\\'t clear yes, I am bisexual as well\\n\\nEdit 3 : I am a man, not a woman as many have thought. I thought that banging a bisexual dude would make it clear 😂 As the title says, I am currently fucking up by being in my girlfriend’s room. \\n\\nYou may be thinking she’s here with me, scared to be caught, but she’s not. In fact she’s nowhere near me, because she’s at school.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I live about an hour away from each other and she has school so you can imagine seeing each other is not the easier thing right away. My girlfriend also lives with her parents, and she’s Asian, meaning no boyfriend until college (though her mom seems okay with it).\\n\\nOn Wednesday we developed a plan to have me sleepover her house without getting caught. The plan was simple, I would come when her parents were gone at work (they own a restaurant) and I would leave in the morning when her dad takes her to school because her mom would still be sleeping.\\n\\nIt went great, I made it out, even ran to my car which wasn’t necessary because by the time her dad was coming back I was driving out of her neighbourhood. \\n\\nFast forward to that night and I end up going back over. Thursday goes good, I go to her room in the morning and end up going back to sleep until she comes home. \\n\\nNow it’s Friday morning. Her dad almost caught us because he wanted to take the recycling out but she quickly got it for him. Then she leaves, I lock her bedroom door and settle in her bed where I’ll be for the next 7 hours waiting for her to come back. \\n\\nHer dad comes back, comes upstairs, tries to open the door. Fuck. It’s locked. He pauses, turns the light on, I assume he looks in her brother’s room, then tries the door again. Still locked for obvious reasons he does not know about. He says something to himself (I don’t speak Chinese but I really wish I did), then goes back downstairs where he sleeps on the couch.\\n\\nI text girlfriend, almost dying because of how scared I am to get caught. She tells me to chill, tells me they don’t have keys to their doors, the only way to open it is to take the handle off. She texts her dad, saying the doors locked and she can unlock it later, he says okay. Her dad doesn’t always listen so that worries me.\\n\\nPretty sure her dad went back to sleep now, and her mom isn’t awake. Now I’m currently laying in her bed wide awake, texting her, asking my parents what to do (have had similar experiences and got caught), and trying not to freak the fuck out because I can’t do anything.\\n\\nEscaping is impossible. Her window has blinds and a screen and is second story. Going downstairs and out the door is foolish, her dad sleeps on the couch and the stairs are noisy. Plus I have no idea what time her mom wakes up.\\n\\nI have no choice but to sit it out for the next 7 hours, maybe try to get some rest but I doubt I will. Anyone have any advice? She’s 19, I’m 20, her parents don’t even know she has a boyfriend.\\n\\nI imagine they’ll be beyond pissed if they find out I’m here, we’ll both be fucked. Not only is she dating me but I’m staying in her house without them knowing. It’s scary to think there could be someone in your house and you wouldn’t even know it, I feel bad for doing this but I love my girlfriend and I’m literal melted butter in her hands.\\n\\nUpdate: probably should have gotten up with her right away but chose to stay in bed... now I have to poop really badly. About 6 more hours to go though. Rip my bowels and my asshole. Also for some reason everything in her house fucking creaks, so I have to be very careful with what I do on the bed, sleeping position wise.\\n\\nUpdate 09:54 am, about 5 more hours: I still have to poop, not as badly though. However a new probably has arose. I grabbed a hard boiled egg earlier when her dad was gone, two baby oranges, and a piece of Hawaiian bread. I ate the egg obviously because I can’t really eat all day, and most of one of the baby oranges, and two bites off the little square of bread. Tummy feels a bit weird. Hope I don’t throw up because it’s very hard to be silent while your guts spill on the floor. Also think of napping but too afraid I’ll let out a massive fart or make some noise. Girlfriend stopped replying due to class. I’ve given up the idea of escaping a long while ago. The dad is of no concern, pretty mid level threat but low for now. Mom is high level once she wakes up though. Hopefully she’ll leave for work but it looks like that might not happen as she isn’t awake yet and supposedly would leave at 10:30. \\n\\nQuick update 09:55am: mom is awake and went downstairs, I think she’ll make breakfast or something. Dad is talking to mom, don’t know what about. Hope they don’t try the door again, really feel like I’m gonna shit and throw up now.\\n\\nGood update 10:03 am: good news, pretty sure the mom just left, pretty sure I can hear her dad snoring. I can finally relax a little. Might actually catch some shut eye. Off to play a bit of fifa mobile and then maybe sleep for a few hours.\\n\\nOkay another update since it was asked for: 10:20 am, mom’s long gone for sure, dad’s asleep, not snoring but I’m pretty sure he’s sleeping. Unfortunately girlfriend hasn’t answered texts for the last two hours I think. Finally beat a team in fifa after playing them for the 20th time. Every time the air conditioner turns on it makes this loud ass noise so every time that happens I get spooked. I’m glad everyone is getting a good laugh out of it. Someone thought this post was fake, which is fine. Not really sure how to prove it’s real. As I said before hiding under the bed is impossible, the only place to hide is her closet which will be a tight squeeze. Hoping it doesn’t come to that. Dad will probably sleep all day, as he stays up all night talking to his friends in China so his body is in another time zone. Might just nap when the girlfriend comes home as she usually naps after class. Thanks for the good luck. See you in an hour or when something interesting happens. \\n\\nUpdated 11:40 am: hello, my girlfriend knows this exists now so hello, enjoy my pain and these comments. So far dad’s still asleep, mom is at work, AC still spooks me. Here’s some answers to questions: gf’s birthday is late, yes dad works but “he can’t handle work” so he goes later (around 6 I think?), and I’ll make it clear now I’m not planning to escape, it would be stupid. I truly think gf’s dad doesn’t care enough to try and bust down the door. Also yes, Florida is a Stand Your Ground are but dad doesn’t own guns, just knives (I feel like I could run faster, used to play soccer and have been practicing boxing for years and more recently muay thai so I know how to run and fight). To those asking for proof, if you tell me how to upload a pic then I’d have no problem doing that. As for my poop situation, I still have to go but it’s not that bad anymore. Yes I have a bit or orange and bread left, and I have headphones that are supplying me with some nice Spotify service. Also, I played campaign mode in fifa, finally beat chapter 2 after 3 days. See you in an hour. \\n\\nNot really an update but I’ll post link to gf and I’d texts and her room door (had to reupload bc her face was exposed) [proof reddit](https://imgur.com/gallery/9Pv91je) \\n\\nUpdate AGAIN: uhhhhh I didn’t see a post that got deleted. I deleted the link to the pic bc it had her face in it, but I uploaded a new pic and posted the link up above. If this shit is deleted then uhhhh what the fuck reddit you wanna fight? As for my bowels, still gotta go but not as badly. I’m probably going to watch some YouTube or Netflix, since sleeping isn’t a good idea. I’ll update in an hour as always. \\n\\nUPDATE: try using your phone to view. Anyway GOOD NEWS. As we speak I am shitting in the toilet. Dad left. Pooping has never felt so good. I’ll update you when my girlfriend comes back.\\n\\nUpdate: girlfriend is home, I pooped as soon as the dad left. Yes I know it’s stupid staying longer but now that my girlfriend is home I’m safe. For those who are asking why didn’t I leave when I got the food, there was a very tiny window to do things, and I didn’t have my bag packed. There will be one more update after this when I get home, the true safe zone. As for now the girlfriend and I are going to play fifa and chill until I have to leave. \\n\\nFINAL UPDATE: hello I am at my house in bed, nowhere near my girlfriend’s parents. I have pooped twice, it went well thank you for asking. About my girlfriend’s age,,, she went to school in China at first, and has a late birthday, therefore she’s making up credits and will be going to actual uni soon. She’s not finished university and gotten a degree, therefore, NO BOYFRIEND. For those of you saying she’s an adult her parents don’t control her... they do. As long as she lives there and they support her financially. Not to mention she isn’t white... She’s Asian (Chinese specifically). I myself am Italian/Cuban, so the same rules go for me until I move out (planning to before the end of next year).  Many of you ask why I didn’t leave when her dad left to pick her up, instead pooping. First off I had to poop so badly. Secondly I won’t see her for awhile, and recently she got hurt so I’ve been helping tend to her wounds so she doesn’t need to go to the hospital (mom’s a nurse, taught me everything since I was young). I wanted to be there for her in person. Also yes, her parents own a restaurant. I won’t post anymore updates (99.9% chance I won’t bc it’s over) but will reply to DM’s and replies :)\\n\\nFinal permanent update: yes it’s about almost a year later, she broke up with me a few months ago. I’m glad you all enjoyed my pain lmao just wanted to write this just in case anyone comes back to read this and is wondering what happened almost a year later. I’m currently happy, perhaps have a bit of a thing going on with a different girl, I’m mentally and physically better than when I did this stupid shit. I will never do this again, and I don’t suggest anyone else does it, I had about 5 heart attacks throughout the whole thing and it was a shitty thing to do, if I was the dad and found out I would be beyond pissed. Sorry Mr.Ex’s Dad. Yeah, I hope everyone is doing well, I’m doing better, enjoy your day/night :)\\n\\n\\n\\nTLDR: currently staying in my girlfriend’s room while her parents are home, doors locked, dad tried to get in, parents don’t even know I exist, no escape route. Also have to shit really badly. I was supposed to graduate with my Masters degree and had invited my whole family to attend my graduation. The only problem was that I told them all that my graduation was on Sunday because I actually thought it was on Sunday. People booked tickets, and cousins were coming from all over America. \\n\\nThis morning I wake up at 11:30 and was casually seeing my Instagram stories to see everyone in robes. My official school account also was posting about people graduating today. So I went back to the email they sent a few weeks ago on the graduation dates -- turns out I missed graduation. I\\'m still lying in bed calculating the magnitude of my stupidity. I don\\'t even know what I\\'m going to tell everyone in my family who\\'s going to come down to \"see me walk\". I MISSED MY OWN GRADUATION!! \\n\\nTL;DR: Thought I was graduating on Sunday but the graduation was today.\\n\\nEdit: JUST FOUND OUT THERE IS ALSO INDIVIDUAL DEPARTMENT CEREMONIES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA. I MISSED THE UNIVERSITY-WIDE CEREMONY BUT I CAN STILL GO TO THE ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT CEREMONY ON MONDAY!!!\\n\\nTHANK YOU u/ifntchingyu TL;DR at bottom.\\n\\nI work in a corporate environment in the marketing department. A portion of what I do is handling the corporate website. One of our mid-level professionals (I\\'ll call her Gina) has recently published an excellent research paper that is topical, relevant and insightful. It\\'s a pretty big deal for her professionally, and the company as a whole.\\n\\nEvery year, we get professional headshots done to feature in corporate documents. It\\'s one guy who does every office, and he\\'s usually pretty good, but with 800 staff and unrealistic deadlines, he\\'ll do colour correction, but no retouching.\\n\\nSo, Gina\\'s paper is being published, and I\\'m called on to do all the marketing around it. This includes getting professional hard copies of the document, a social media strategy and some conference speaking work.\\n\\nThe thing is, Gina\\'s headshot is a little... off.\\n\\nAs a thumbnail, it\\'s fine, but when it\\'s zoomed in, you can see a definite moustache. Not a little \"maybe she ate a chocolate doughnut for lunch\" mo, but a lip full of whiskers that you\\'d expect to see on a 90 year old woman who enjoys hitting children with her walking stick.\\n\\nSo, I can\\'t exactly call up and ask if I should do something about this, as it\\'s not really a conversation I want to have, and I\\'m also not known as the most tactful person. I\\'m very familiar with Photoshop, and use it all the time (I\\'ve got no Graphic Design qualifications though, so I\\'m very slow by comparison), so I go about just blending and masking her whiskers a bit. I\\'m zoomed right in on her mouth to clean up the zone.\\n\\nI work in an open office, but not many people are in my immediate area. Still, it\\'s not something I want to embarrass her about, so any time someone walks by, I alt-tab to a different screen, or move the pic to a different area.\\n\\nLo and behold, Gina decides to drop by with her feedback on the printed draft that she\\'s marked up. As she comes by, I hear her footsteps and hit the scroll wheel on the mouse. She comes in and freezes, asks what I\\'m doing. I say Im just tweaking a picture, and when I look at my own screen, it\\'s zoomed right in on her cleavage.\\n\\nShe gets louder and asks what the fuck I\\'m doing fixing her chest area. She then asks if I\\'m making her breasts bigger, or doing something shady. For some reason, I decide to avoid telling her the truth and just say I\\'m evening out the skin tone.\\n\\nShe dumps the hard copy draft and walks away.\\n\\nAbout an hour later, I get an email from HR saying that I need to stop working on this project, and come in for an interview.  I ask if I can speak privately first, and explain the situation. I still get in a lot of trouble for fixing an image without her consent, and that Gina is more than her appearance, and a suggestion that it\\'s sexist to try and \"make her prettier\". I acknowledge that, but also mention that I tidy up all images that are going to be blown up, men and women alike, but to be honest, I\\'m just trying to get out of the awkwardness. \\n\\nWe have the meeting, and I had to explain the whole thing to Gina directly. She is adamant that she doesn\\'t have a moustache (an to be fair, while sitting there, she doesn\\'t. She\\'s sorted that out in the days between the pic and this event). She then goes on to suggest that I altered the pic to add the lip hair as an excuse for staring at her chest (worth noting here, she wasn\\'t dressed provocatively or anything, just normal corporate wear).\\n\\nI then had to get the photographer to re-send the originals to the HR rep, and they indeed show her lip-bristles.\\n\\nShe\\'s still livid, and HR suggest that I should jump off this project. \\n\\nI\\'m actually a bit concerned as to where this leaves me going forward, as she does have a bit of influence. I told my boss the whole story and he\\'s assured me I\\'ll be fine, in-between being sympathetic, and stifling his laughter at my misfortune.\\n\\nTL:DR: Tried to edit a moustache out of a female colleague\\'s professional headshot, didn\\'t want to embarrass her by letting other people see, she walks by and I reflexively scroll down to hide the mouth and it looks like I\\'m zoomed in on her breasts.  So this happened earlier in the week but is NSFW so posting on the weekend. Also on my throwaway acc. since I don\\'t want this story going back to the IRL me.\\n\\nSo at uni as apart of their safe sex promotion, we get given condoms in our \"welcome to uni\" packs for students who live in the university-run accommodation. I\\'d always chucked these in my drawer for \"future use\" if the situation requiring them ever arose. It never has and so I took them home over summer and they\\'ve been sitting in my drawers at home ever since.\\n\\nAnyway, I\\'m on intersemester break right now so I (19M) was back home, and poking around in my old stuff found some of them. I decided I\\'d open the wrapper since I\\'d never actually used one before or tried putting one on (parents took me out of sex-ed for religious reasons), and I thought it might be good to try one on and try out masturbating with it, so promptly opened the wrapper.\\n\\nAs I discovered, and the majority of the sexually active population probably know, condoms come kind of lubed already and for whatever reason I took a smell since I could kind of tell it smelt weird.\\n\\nWhen I did this, I realised that I had not only smelt this scent before, but knew exactly how it tasted. I have memories of chewing on uninflated balloons quite a lot when I was younger (same with rubber bands) and the one memory in particular which became very vivid of was finding a balloon in my parents room and happily chewing on that. Except now I realise it *wasn\\'t* a balloon and was in fact, a used condom. I felt pretty sick then.\\n\\nI wish I could delete memories and that I\\'d never remembered/realised this.\\n\\nTL;DR  got out a condom to try it out, realised I\\'ve tasted condoms before.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: A lot of people are asking how my parents use both contraception but also took me out of sex-ed. I have no idea how to label their breed of christian but it\\'s definitely not catholic. I think it\\'s something like evangelical or baptist or nondenominational.\\n\\nI think the reasons for taking me out of sex ed was to shelter me from learning about sex in a non-religious context, such as not being constantly taught that \"pre-marital sex is sin, homosexual sex is sin, oral sex is sin, masturbating is sin, etc.\" I\\'m also from New Zealand, not North America as a few have assumed. Here it\\'s taught in year 9 and 10 (ages 13-15) which they decided was too early for me, although they never gave me \"the talk\" either.\\n\\nThe \"balloon\" was also found under my parents bed, not in a drawer.\\n\\nThank you for the awards, I wish they could make me forget, at least there is a small positive now from fake internet points. So with a new patio in the back garden being done, we have a local handyman there doing his thing. Naturally I offer to make him a drink, to which he replies black coffee. Now, being a clueless, tea drinking Brit, I assume black coffee is a type of branded coffee or something. Can\\'t find it, make him a normal milky coffee instead. Perfect.\\n\\nI apologise to him saying we don\\'t have any black coffee, to which he laughs - not sure why at the time. I hand over this milky mug of coffee to him and his face instantly shifts to the most defeated look ever. The couple seconds of silence were ended with him saying \"Cheers mate\" in a disappointed manner.\\n\\nThis continued for the rest of the day, every time he asked for a coffee until he eventually went home. Eventually found out it\\'s just coffee with no milk. Can\\'t look him in the eye now.\\n\\nTL;DR: Gave someone who wanted black coffee milk coffee multiple times without realising it\\'s just coffee without milk\\n\\nEdit: A lot of people asking...I\\'m 19 Shit River 2K19\\n\\nWe have a thousand words to explain all that transpired with Our Dear Friend Paul from August 3rd to August 4th, 2019. Let me spin you a tale...a tale of Shit River.\\n\\n4:30 pm\\n\\nOur initial impressions of the house were terrific! Our illustrious host, Paul, left a bottle of red for us on the table along with some chocolates and popcorn. Paul was friendly! Check-in was quick and easy so our party settled in. Everything was looking great!\\n\\n6:00 pm\\n\\nWe return from purchasing perishables for the weekend. We fill the fridge as we prepare for a relaxing and restorative vacation. We had all traveled far and been looking forward to this rare reunion! A few days on the beach does wonderful things for the soul, but little did we know how our souls would be blackened forevermore.\\n\\n8:15 pm\\n\\nAfter a round or five of drinks, we noticed that several members of the party had disappeared and were nowhere to be found. We discovered them, ominous plunger in hand, staring terrified at a slowly rising toilet (one of two in the house). Plunging half successfully, we messaged Paul and let him know the situation. Only one working toilet isn’t ideal for a group of 8 twenty-somethings drunk on beer and full of tacos, but we’d make it work!\\n\\n8:38 pm\\n\\nThe remaining toilet won’t flush. The party grows worried. Paul assures us that he will call a plumber.\\n\\n9:00 pm\\n\\nPaul has no luck with his usual plumber; they won’t be able to fix the toilets until the next morning. A five second Google search reveals there are twelve (12!) emergency, 24 hour plumbers in Virginia Beach, but Paul did not want to call them. After “informing” Our Dear Friend Paul of our displeasure, he put his nose to the grindstone and made a few calls. A plumber was found! Magic!\\n\\n9:30 pm\\n\\nRaw sewage floods the shower and both toilets. Kitchen sink makes a strange noise when turned on. The House likely possessed. Drinks have been drunk like it’s the end of prohibition and we cannot drive or Uber to safety. After all, where would we go? We pray to whatever Eldritch creature haunts our plumbing to spare us.\\n\\n10:01 pm\\n\\nThe stench. Dear god. The STENCH.\\n\\n11:20 pm\\n\\nEmergency plumber arrives with Paul and Paul’s Friend in tow. One of them goes to the roof. One of them pounds a Pabst Blue Ribbon. Advance guard sobered up and makes an emergency run to a public bathroom. We split the party.\\n\\n12:20 am\\n\\nPlumber ventures inside the splash zone to duct tape garbage bags around the toilets to seal them in preparation for “The Final Blasting.” Paul’s Friend fails to discover how to “switch off his nose” and taps out (“I’m out man, I’m out.”). It’s been hours since most of us have relieved ourselves. The backyard beckons us with its soothing siren call, but we resist. *For now.*\\n\\n12:22 am\\n\\nPaul assures us the problem will soon be fixed and to keep partying. Classic Paul! We oblige, blithely unaware of the horror shit show still awaiting us.\\n\\n12:24 am\\n\\nTHE FINAL BLASTING. The Stench. The Horror. The Splatter. We all take 2d6 damage.\\n\\n1:00 am\\n\\nPaul & Co. tell us the bathrooms are fixed but not to flush toilet paper. He requests we instead put used toilet paper in conveniently provided (bagless) trash cans. We decide to maximize our fun and minimize our bathroom usage. We also decide to leave the next morning.\\n\\n2:00 am: The Witching Hour\\n\\nLights flicker ominously. The House isn’t finished with us yet…\\n\\n4:30 am\\n\\nPaul offers a full refund (excellent). He later tries to convince us to stay and only refund the first night (not excellent). We ask for a full refund and promise to evacuate in the morning. He offers to let us stay for free for the remainder of our reservation (excellent?) but we decline and agree to leave by noon (clairvoyant).\\n\\n10:30 am\\n\\nThe party prepares to leave after a night of sheer terror. We take trash to trash cans, clean the kitchen, and prepare a sacrifice to the Toilet Gods.\\n\\n11:10 am\\n\\nWe commence the cleansing ritual in the kitchen. After completion, we agree never to speak of this again. Who would believe our onerous, nay odorous, experience?\\n\\n11:11 am\\n\\nTHE GREAT GURGLE. We hear, deep from the bowels of hell, a cursed glugging. Was it the broken spirit of Paul\\'s Friend chugging another PBR? NOPE. The shower had once again started flooding with raw sewage.\\n\\n11:15 am\\n\\nWe hasten our efforts to flee. Paul is called. We finish packing all but the final suitcases into our cars.\\n\\n11:30 am\\n\\nWe convene to discuss departure. Suddenly, one of our party realizes we’ve been cut off from the last of our supplies by a seeping SHIT RIVER POOLING IN THE HALLWAY. Fearing the end is nigh, a brave hero bounds forth, vaulting across the rising flood waters of the Rubicon. We form a fire line to ferry our belongings and our wounded to safety.\\n\\n11:32 am\\n\\nWater oozes up from the baseboards. Satan\\'s Septic Tank thirsts for blood. The lights flicker once more.\\n\\n11: 35 am\\n\\nOur Dearest Friend Paul arrives, eloquently prophesying: “This house is fucked.” Agreeing with Paul\\'s uncanny observation, we flee The House. The smell stayed with us for days but the memories will haunt us forever.\\n\\nTL;DR I trusted my Airbnb to have functional plumbing but instead it exploded. This happened last night and it was my wife. I have to share this here because I have no one IRL that I dare tell. \\n\\nMy wife came home from her gyno about a month ago and excitedly told me that she learned about a non surgical vaginal rejuvenation. I was a bit shocked by that but then I learned that the main reason for getting this was to reduce or eliminate her stress incontinence (pee when you laugh, cough, or sneeze. She told me that it was a bit expensive but added that it would also tighten her tunnel o love. Honestly, I\\'m happy with what she has to offer right now but why the hell not? \\n\\nSo, she had the procedure yesterday and wanted me to see the \"amazing\" before and after results. I have to admit that I was impressed by how everything seemed to have tucked in a little more but whatever. I tell her that I want to save that pic in my phone and she laughed at first. My wife isn\\'t the nude pic taking kind of girl. She has sent me a few over the years and I have them locked away in one of those password protected apps. I didn\\'t want one of the kids to stumble on their mom\\'s nude pics. \\n\\nLater that evening, she tells me that she wants to save the pic but wants to delete it from her phone. I tell her that I\\'ll keep it safely and she agrees that it\\'s a good idea. \"Just text it to me\".  So she did, or so she thought. She asked me if I had gotten it and I told her no. She said that it should be there by now so she opened her phone to check. We both had that speechless moment when we realized in horror that she sent a close-up shot of her coochie to our oldest son. It was a collage with a before and after shot. \\n\\nShe was yelling, \"Unsend! Take it back!\" but it was too late. (Apple, please add this feature!) Now it was time for damage control. I told her, \"You can\\'t let him think it\\'s yours.\" She quickly agreed. At about that moment, he sent back a text in three parts. What. The. Fuck???  We decided to tell him that this was a sample pic that she was sending her friend to get feedback on a procedure. It seemed legitimate and we hope that he\\'s gullible enough to believe it. If it were me, I would readily believe it because I would WANT to! \\n\\nWe averted a real crisis but questions remain. What if he liked the look and unknowingly jerked off to his mom\\'s vag? What if he saves it and it becomes great jerk off material. Regardless, he has unknowingly looked into the eye of the same lovely rose that birthed him. My wife didn\\'t find any of this funny but I had a good laugh. \\n\\nTLDR; Wife sent a post vag rejuvenation pic to her son but he doesn\\'t know it was his mother\\'s. The title pretty much says it all. Today, after eating a large Thanksgiving meal and partaking in two glasses of wine, I decided to pump and dump. I retreated to an upstairs bedroom, set myself up, and started pumping. \\n\\nThe fateful combination of baby-induced sleep deprivation, copious carbs, and wine left me feeling...drowsy. As I sat in the rocking chair waiting for the pump to do it\\'s thing I felt myself nodding off. I figured I would doze for a few minutes while I finished pumping and then return to the (Covid-compliant) family gathering in a timely manner. \\n\\nNo such luck. I awoke over an hour later, clueless as to the length of my slumber, with nipples the size of wine corks emitting sad puffs of dust with each cycle of the pump. Hours later it still feels as though satan himself tried to suck my soul out through my nipples. \\n\\nOn the plus side, my otherwise latch-struggling baby has had no problems nursing since my nipples grew 3 sizes today. \\n\\nTL;DR: fell asleep pumping breastmilk, woke up with giant painful nipples.\\n\\nETA: If you\\'re breastfeeding or pumping and do decide to imbibe, please be aware that pumping and dumping does not lower the alcohol content in your milk. I pumped and dumped to relieve discomfort, but only time can remove alcohol from your breastmilk. It metabolizes out, and generally takes 2-3 hours per beverage consumed. So I (M 22) work in a factory that is slightly short staffed, so from time to time some of the office staff have to come through to the factory and help out. One of these office workers is a (F 18) who we\\'ll call Jess. So Jess was in the factory helping out and I happened to walk past her wearing some rubber gloves. Now Jess and I have a friendly bit of banter from time to time, and so as I was passing her she looked at my gloves and said \\n\\n\"You look like you\\'re about to go finger a cow\"\\n(Which is a bit of a weird thing to say, but hey ho) \\n\\nSo me being the master of wit that I am instantly thought \"right, now\\'s my time to shine! If I say the right thing I could turn this into a funny insult and call her a cow\"\\nMy brain decided malfunction and what actually came out was\\n\\n\"I\\'ll finger you\"\\n\\nNot surprisingly this immediately drew a funny look from her and i felt my face start to glow red from awkwardness...\\nBecause of the level of noise I  the factory I have sort of developed a loud voice in order to be heard. It just so happened that one of the machines cut out at almost the same moment and the factory went *relatively* quiet. Everybody in the immediate vicinity heard and looked over at me...\\nAt this point I wanted to just crawl into a hole, but I stood my ground and tried explaining myself\\n\\n\"I meant that as though you\\'re a cow, not that I actually want to finger you\"\\n\\nThis seemed to clear things up for her but now everyone at work keeps making fingering puns and innuendo\\'s. \\nI can\\'t look Jess in the eye any more. Works gonna be a little awkward for a while...\\n\\nTl/Dr:  female workmate said I looked like I was going to go \"finger a cow\" so as my attempt a a witty response I said \"I\\'ll finger you.\" Now workmates are ripping me a new one by constantly making fingering references\\n\\nEdit: My first silver and gold! I\\'m glad my fuck up was able to entertain you all a little 😂 thank you, Internet strangers!\\n\\nEdit 2: holy shit,  platinum?? Anonymous platinum giver, if you were a cow I would definitely finger you😂 I spent about five years diagnosed as a type 2. Nothing worked to bring my blood glucose down. I went to a zero carb diet for a while and, I\\'ll admit it kept me from hitting the 300+ zone, but staying above 250 for that amount of time left me a husk of a man. I was tired even though I slept 12 or more hours a day, I stopped playing video games because I simply didn\\'t have the energy or focus to enjoy them, and sex was a chore.\\n\\nAbout two weeks ago, My GP finally said that she would get me an appointment with an endocrinologist. He diagnosed me as type 1 on the spot, did some blood work to prove it, and called my GP \"An absolutely dangerous idiot for waiting this long.\"\\n\\nNow? I haven\\'t had a single reading above 200. I\\'m eating carbs again. I had my first bowl of cereal in five years last night and my meter read 116 at the end of two hours after it.\\n\\nSo, last night, I felt fantastic. I did my old highschool weight lifting routine, I went for a 20 minute jog, and I had the best sex ever with my wife.\\n\\nGreat, right?\\n\\nI wake up this morning and notice something. It hurts to breathe. Every muscle and bone in my body hates me.\\n\\nLearn from my mistake. Don\\'t over do it just because you feel like Superman. You\\'re very much still human.\\n\\nWaking up to coffee with cream and my wife making oatmeal made it better. \\n\\nTL;DR I ran way to hard last night. Body is in so much pain. I couldn\\'t be happier. Actually happened yesterday. The effects are still rampant this morning.  \\n\\nGrocery shopping with my one year old girl. She’s just the sweetest. Really loves cooking and shopping with her daddy. Is chatty with anyone that will talk to her and waves at literally everyone. \\n\\nSo of course we’ve been teaching her to say every day words as well as any new ones we think she can pick up on. She’s getting quite the vocabulary for being so little. \\n\\nAs it goes I decided to grill some chicken and have a nice garden salad for dinner with a homemade balsamic vinaigrette. I took my little angel to the store with me to grab a few things and when I picked up the balsamic vinegar, I heard a familiar question:\\n\\n*what’s that?* \\n\\nI told her it was balsamic vinegar, which she pronounced “ba salty n-word” I tried to correct her to no avail. Her decision was concrete.  \\n\\nMy adorable little girl is passing out n-words. I’m mortified. She’s loudly and proudly saying her new words.\\n\\nWe scurried out with no groceries/people staring and ordered pizza for dinner. She’s still asking this morning when we’re going to EAT ba salty n-word.\\n\\nTL;DR tried to teach my one year old to say “balsamic vinegar” she is now saying “ba salty n-word” with reckless abandon.\\n\\nEdit: her 4 year old brother is now saying it too. One guess who is staying home from pre school today.\\n\\nEdit2: some people are asking about how she’s speaking so well at a year. She’s actually 13 months old but i detest giving her age in months now that she’s reached a year. \\n\\nShe talks constantly, asks for things, says please and thank you, knows names for specific toys and items. Asks for specific things to eat. Knows all of our names in our immediate family and grandparents. \\n\\nThe how is we taught her to speak along with ASL (American sign language), so before she could speak she could ask for milk, or more, or to be changed and a few other things before she was able to vocalize her needs. It’s the best parenting thing we’ve ever done.\\n\\nEdit3: I’m really enjoying reading all the stories of other kids mixing up words. This post will definitely be saved as a gift for her 21st.\\n\\nLast edit: I’m pretty sick of some people saying my daughter can’t talk, and that kids don’t speak until 18mo-2years. Here’s a small [article](https://www.babycenter.com/404_when-can-i-start-teaching-my-baby-sign-language_1368485.bc)  with 5 sources advocating ASL for babies. It helped her develop her spoken words more easily. Don’t be a dick about my kid you fucking don’t know it all shitbags. I\\'m on mobile at the moment so I apologize in advance for any formatting issues and all that jizz...I mean jazz. That will be funny, soon. Maybe. \\nSo let\\'s begin our story with an obligatory: This actually happened today. Just a few minutes ago. \\nMy husband, let\\'s call him \"Steven\"  and I were getting it on like married couples do and all was well. I had a one-way ticket to pound town and it was the ride of my life. We\\'re just about to our destination when Steven takes a detour and stands up. He looks at me and says, \"Come here.\" I know the drill. This is the moment I\\'ve been training for. I get on my knees and start doing my thing...or his thing, really. Before I know it, bam. Our destination is right around the corner. Our ride to pound town has just about cum to a close. The big finale.\\n\\n So Steven looks down at me and gives me the look, lifts my chin up, and I open. Now this is where the FU truly begins. I open up my mouth of course but I also decided in the moment that THIS time, I wasn\\'t just going to close my eyes and stick my tongue out. No. THIS time, I was going to stare deep into this man\\'s eyes sensually as he shoots his load into my mouth. I mean, that\\'s a thing, right? Eye contact to show mutual appreciation for the awesome sex you are finishing? Well the real problem was, I wasn\\'t the only one who decided to switch things up. You see, in the same moment I decided to open my eyes and look into Steven\\'s, he had decided that this time he wouldn\\'t just pop that load into my mouth. He was going to let it explode all over my face.\\n\\nI\\'m sure you see what\\'s happening here. Which is good, because now I cant see shit. I couldn\\'t really measure it, but I\\'m fairly certain that 70% of Steven\\'s load went straight into my eyes. I proceeded to close them as if I could squeeze my way out of this problem. Unfortunately there was no un-squeezing what had already been squeezed into these eyeballs. I hopped in the shower, cleaned up, and rinsed my eyes with water, assuming that would be the solution. My eyes felt like they were on fire at this point. I then turned to actual solution. Contact solution, to be exact. I squirted some in each eye and felt my eyes burning from the inside out. Or so I thought. I looked in the mirror to find that I now look higher than every member of the gang on \"That 70s Show\" put together. For those of you that don\\'t understand the effect of doing the weeds, my eyes are bloodshot. Redder the devil\\'s butthole. I\\'ve now used some Clear Eyes in hopes that the burning, redness, and twitching of my eyes will soon dwindle away. I\\'m truly afraid to go to sleep and wake up blind.\\n\\n Friends, I just want to say that if you have a Steven in your life, please communicate with him about how and where his loads will be shot. Don\\'t be like me. If you think about being sexy and looking into his eyes while he finishes, I implore you to reconsider. If anyone actually reads this, thank you for being a part of this journey with me. Steven is now sound asleep while I wonder if my eyes will fall out before sunrise.\\n\\nTL;DR Decided to open my eyes during sexy time trying to be sensual, and got literal eyefuls of cum that have caused immense pain, redness, and twitching. If I go blind tonight, I\\'ll miss you Reddit.\\n\\nEDIT: \\n1) Added paragraphs. My eyes were burning and I\\'ve never written a post this long on Reddit using mobile before, so I didn\\'t realize you could still paragraph. Whatever. You get the point. \\n\\n2) For you sweet souls asking me how I am, I still have eyes! My eyes still hurt but not nearly as much as before. According to some comments, I made a mistake in using contact solution, and in using eye drops. What can I say? I\\'m good at making problems worse than they need to be.\\n\\n3) I know not everyone who reads this will believe that it\\'s real and that\\'s okay. I seriously did not expect more than five people to ever even come across this post let alone thousands. Thank you to everyone who has read this regardless of whether you believe it\\'s true or not. I honestly wish it wasn\\'t. I\\'m glad you took the time to read about my ridiculous mishap anyway. \\n\\n4) Thank you for every award, every kind comment, and message. I knew Reddit was cool but holy cow you guys are amazing and I\\'m so thankful! You all made my night. Hope you have amazing days/nights and keep cum out of your eyes for all of eternity! TIFU by accidentally taking a double dose of my ADHD meds.\\n\\n\\nSo I’m prescribed 50mg of Vyvanse, and have been since I was 14. 50mg is a higher dose for someone in my age/weight bracket (early 20s F, 115 lbs) because the highest legal dose is 70mg.\\n\\n\\nI have a bizarre sleep schedule with a cute sprinkle of insomnia, so some nights I don’t fall asleep until 5am, and that’s what happened last night (this morning). I set an alarm for 10am, woke up around 10:30, took my Vyvanse, laid down for a little bit, and somehow fell back to sleep. \\n\\n\\nAt about 11:30-12 I wake back up, still groggy. It takes my Vyvanse about 2 hours to fully kick in, so I’m still a little out of it. This is where I fucked up.\\n\\n\\nI’m so used to waking up and just BEING up that I started my morning routine over again on autopilot. I strolled over the coffee machine, started to make some, and took my dose of Vyvanse. I realized about 10 seconds after I’d taken it that I had already taken it. \\n\\n\\nHere’s the thing, I can’t throw up. I’ve thrown up twice in my entire life. So that wasn’t an option. Cue frantic googling. Pretty much everyone says I’m going to be in for a wild day, and to stay hydrated. I try to look on the bright side—maybe I’ll get a lot of work done today!—but I was foolish. \\n\\n\\nIt’s been 3 hours since my last dose. I’ve peed around twenty times. I can feel my blood. I took one hit from my Juul and transcended time and space. My stomach is furious. I tried to reorganize my room, started to hammer something into the wall, hit my thumb. Cried. Put my clothes in the dryer and then felt like I needed to have them Extra Dry so I ran them again, the lint in there started burning. Cried. All of my whites now smell like Chicago in 1871. \\n\\n\\nMy body is in fight or flight. I’m so anxious. 30 min ago my mom’s best friend texted me ‘Your parents’ and nothing else. By the time she responded to my ‘???’ fifteen minutes later with the picture of my mom and dad when they were younger that she meant to attach, I had already accepted that I was an orphan and was halfway through an article re: how to deal with the sudden passing of your parents. My cat came into my bedroom and I got scared. I didn’t like her stance or general demeanor. \\n\\n\\nCurrently, I’m applying for grad school. I don’t know why. I’m not even done with undergrad. But it feels like something I should do right now. \\n\\n\\nAnyway. I’ll be fine. I’ve actually done this one other time and ended up being alright, just very fast for a while. Have a good one, all. Take meds responsibly.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR I took 100mg of Vyvanse when I’m prescribed 50mg, am currently paranoid, distraught, and feeling like I have an IQ of 1000 and -17 at the same time.\\n\\n\\nEDIT: Holy shit! I appreciate all of the concerns and nice comments lol. I’m doing alright, I’ve had a lot of water and feel 75% normal. Still wide awake, obviously. Hopefully this inspired a few people to use those pill organizers. I just ordered one. Also, I did not finish applying to grad school. I made the amazing decision to take out loans for undergrad in NYC and if I get into any more debt I’ll never be able to afford groceries.\\n\\nEDIT 2: Again, yes, I did get a pill organizer. Thank you for the Amazon links. My heart rate is still fucked, but getting better. After reading everyone’s replies, I think I’m going to try to lower my dose a little bit—some of y’all’s stories about long-term effects freaked me out. But I’m okay, really! My girlfriend and I (both female) are quite experimental in the bedroom department and we are familiar with normal dildos, never had an issue figuring out how to use them. It is straightforward and simple with a normal strap on. Well, we started speculating on buying one of these “ejaculating” dildos a couple of months ago and I decided to bite the bullet for Christmas and get her a kinky Christmas surprise - for opening in private of course. I also got this cum-like lube which looks surprisingly realistic. \\n\\nSo we open it up and obviously want to get right down to it on Christmas Day but due to family commitments we have to put it aside, crack on with the day and we vow to get down to experimenting with it tomorrow night when we have some proper alone time which was Boxing Day evening. \\n\\nBoxing Day evening rolls around and we’ve both been pretty horny during the day. The anticipation has grown and as soon as evening chill time hits we proceed to the chill part of Netflix & Chill.\\n\\nWe’re getting down to it on the sofa and the time comes to get out our new ejaculating dildo. We’re both pretty excited as the fantasy has been building for a while. I’m bisexual so I obviously still like the feel of a penis and a load of cum in me or on me, and she’s dominant in the bedroom so enjoys playing that role.\\n\\nWe excitedly grab the box and slide the big boy out. If you’re unfamiliar with what they look like they have a long thin tube attached through the middle of the dildo with a syringe type thing at the end where you load the “cum” in, and then you obviously press the syringe down when you want it to “ejaculate” out of the hole at the end of the dildo. We don’t bother reading the instructions fully. We are firmly in the moment, it is dark and we want to get on with it. \\n\\nWe are totally new to this but figure how hard can it be!? Here is our first mistake. We need scissors to cut the tube down to size. It was really long and we could make out on the instructions in the dark that we needed to cut it down. We have the background light of the TV on but the main light off in the front room as I’m paranoid that neighbours can see in through the thin curtains so I insist on the main light being off. I’m butt naked on the sofa, shes butt naked and putting the strap on on, and in retrospect maybe turning the light on would have helped a lot in the situation. So we run to the kitchen, guess how much to cut the tube down and hope for the best. It ended up quite short. \\n\\nShe gets the dildo on, we take the top off the syringe bit which is actually quite large - in the dark - we load it up but unfortunately being amateurs with the ejaculating side of it, we fill it right up to the top of the syringe, pop the top back on and feel we are good to go.\\n\\nHere’s where it starts to go wrong. I immediately felt when she put it in me that it was “cumming” in me quite violently. I’m like woah, one pump and a squirt is not what I signed up for here. So I tell her to take it out because at this point I am the cream pie. I am filling up faster than town when the Boxing Day sales start. She wasn’t pushing the syringe at all. She takes it out and it’s literally just...... cumming. It won’t stop. \\n\\nI turn over in a half horny, half irritated state to try and figure it out and I’m nearly at eye line with the bulging, cumming dildo which then literally ejaculates all over my shoulder and the back on my sofa as I dive to the side to avoid it going in my eye. As I do this, I proceed to knock a drink all over the floor, the throws and anything else that was beside the sofa in my foot line. Great, the dildo is quite literally projectile cumming. My sofa is sticky with this stuff and I’m flailing around holding the end of the dildo trying to stop it and I’m like fuck it, let’s just make it cum all over my tits to get it all out so we can crack on. I was exasperated at this point. \\n\\nWe try and aim it at my tits to make it a bit sexier in the moment, I’m there with my head back like I’m ready to take a decent load and it literally showers me. My entire torso, my tits, my stomach, my shoulders. It is not like a quaint little load that usually comes from a penis. There is not one area this stuff did not squirt. Once the monster had finished squirting it’s endless load at me, it sounded like it was gently queefing which really helped the sexy atmosphere, as you can imagine. My girlfriend was desperately trying to clean me off a little and just ended up spreading it all over me and essentially rubbing it in. It was gross. I assume the air bubble combined with the overfilling of the syringe contributed to the “difficulties” we had operating it.\\n\\nWe were pretty traumatized by that point. The reality was definitely not the same as the fantasy. We took it off and continued the traditional way. When we turned on the lights at the end, all I can say is it looked like an ejaculation massacre. We’re going to fill it a little less next time and properly read the instructions.\\n\\nTL;DR - accidentally overfilled our new ejaculating penis, culminating in a cum stained massacre all over me and our front room.\\n\\n\\n**Edit** - We really did not expect this post to blow up as it has! Truly glad that our experience has given you all some laughter!\\n\\nIn keeping with our tradition of naming our dildos, we have decided that Queefer Sutherland has been born. Thanks for all the love. Being half japanese, I take a trip to Japan every two years with my dad to visit relatives, sightseeing etc. Unfortunately I was never actually taught Japanese so having my dad there with me is super useful when I need assistance. On our trips my dad usually takes a day to go hangout with his old friends (we live in the US) and usually leaves me at our hotel or whatever. Today was one of those days. While laying in bed watching Pewdiepie’s minecraft videos I got quite hungry and thought to myself “I can go down to the convenience store and get some snacks by myself right?” Normally, yes. So I take a couple thousand yen that my dad left me and walk to the nearest family mart (for those of you who don’t know it’s a japanese convenience store.) I browse the shelves a bit and up buying a bento meal, mentos, and a diet coke. Checking out goes fine since I don’t really need to communicate, just hand over money. So as I walk back to my hotel in the middle of a crowded sidewalk my dumbass decided to pop a few mentos in my mouth just because. So I suck on those for a while and than without even thinking about the consequences I take a HUGE swig of diet coke, like so big that i can’t swallow all of it and it’s just sitting in my mouth. Than all of a sudden so feel a very weird foaming in my mouth. Than it hits me. I remember the experiments I did in elementary school, the crazy russian hacker vids, etc. That was the very moment I knew I fucked up. So before I can think literally anything else it’s foaming out of my mouth and I choke a little and end up just spewing out this diet coke foam. So obviously the people around me notice and come up to me and start speaking japanese. And of course I am sitting there, completely clueless. They were probably asking me if I needed help? I am dying of sheer embarrassment so I deadass just bolt back to my hotel with foam dripping down my face and clothes, im feeling sticky everywhere and life is not good. Once I get back to my hotel room and start to settle in I remember that I left my actual food on the sidewalk. So I just ended up starving until my dad came home and brought some leftovers. \\n\\nTL;DR: I mixed mentos and diet coke into my mouth in front of a bunch of people who didn’t speak the same language as me and sheer embarrassment ensued. So this has been going on since I graduated in May and started applying for jobs. I\\'ve submitted over 100 applications for engineering jobs around the country and I have not had much feedback. Well the vast majority of these jobs have you check boxes with disabilities you may have and since I have ADHD, I have been checking the box marked \"Intellectual Disability\" all these months. \\n\\n\\nSo about fifteen minutes ago I\\'m going through an application like normal and I get to the part where they ask about disabilities. This is what it reads: \"Intellectual Disability (formerly described as mental retardation)\". I feel sick to my stomach knowing that I\\'ve been applying for jobs that I really want and I have unknowingly classified myself as mentally retarded. I don\\'t deserve these jobs for being so dumb and fucking up all these applications.\\n\\n\\nTLDR: I\\'ve been checking the \"Intellectual Disability\" in applications to declare ADHD when that actual means mental retardation. I\\'ve fucked up over a hundred job applications. Hey r/tifu, I wanted to share this experience because I\\'m still riding high on the no pain drug :) hope this can convince someone else to go to the fucking Dr if they need to. \\n\\nI guess the FU was actually over two years ago. I had just quit my job on a whim and decided to move to NYC. Money was tight and I was living with my parents until I could find work and a place to live. \\n\\nI was chilling on the couch eating popcorn when I bit down on something hard. The pain was excruciating and what I though might be a popcorn kernel ended up being a large chunk of my second molar. \\n\\nWith no health Insurance of any kind, I was terrified of what the bill was going to be. but the pain was so bad I sucked it up and went to my dentist. The dentist drilled away and put a temp cap on what used to be a tooth. Before I left he told me \" that was a deep cavity, if it still hurts in a week you will need a root canal\". \\n\\nThe pain from breaking the tooth was so bad it was a relief to have the cap on. But I noticed quickly that I could not drink anything cold on the side of my mouth. I figured this was just due to how deep the filling went. I started tilting my head to drink cold water.  Then my GF started telling me I was eating in my sleep. After a few weeks she became concerned. \"You are slamming your teeth together and grinding the shit out of them at night\" she said. I bought a mouth guard. A few months In and I started to wake up with headaches. Looking back, these all should have been signs of how much pain I was in. \\n\\n1 yr later: I have great health insurance but I\\'m not really In noticable pain. It\\'s annoying that I can\\'t drink cold water on that side and that I wake up with headaches every morning but... W.e I deal with it. I can tell one side of my mouth feel different but again I write it off and just chew on the other side when needed. \\n\\nFast forward to the global pandemic: I start waking up with shooting pain so unbearable that I can\\'t get back to sleep for hours. After a few weeks of little to no sleep FINALLY it\\'s time to go to the dentist. My dentist is a pro, he looks me over taps on my teeth with some metal thing and says \" time for that root canal bud\".\\n\\n It happened fast, my primary dentist sends me over to the oral surgeon right from his office. But, the oral surgeon can\\'t figure out what is going on. He has some sort of liquid nitrogen tool that he is spraying onto my teeth and telling me to raise my hand when it hurts. But I\\'m not raising my hand. He\\'s getting pretty upset and saying \"OP, this is no time to be brave. this much cold should be excruciating even on a healthy tooth\". It\\'s feels strange i tell him. Annoyed and confused the Dr leaves to go call my primary. When he comes back he says: I trust primary, if he says you need a root canal then that\\'s what we will do. \\n\\nThe whole process was super easy, don\\'t let anyone tell you root canals hurt. It was honestly easier than getting a cavity filled.  It was done in 40 min and I felt NOTHING. The surgeon told me to expect pain for a few days also some jaw soreness. But, the weird thing is: I felt AMAZING. I hadn\\'t even realized how much pain I was in over the past two years. Compared to that pain, the soreness from the procedure felt great. Right after the novacane wore off I felt incredibly strange and clear headed for the first time I could remember. I was less irritable and I wasn\\'t clenching my jaw like I usually do. \\n\\nLooking back, I couldn\\'t feel the cold test because my nerves were already maxed out on pain and had been for a long time. Waking up the morning after, I feel like a whole new person. I can\\'t believe I was able to ignore that level of pain for that long but it feels like a drug not to have it. I haven\\'t taken any pain meds for my tooth because it feels so great just to have a tiny bit of soreness around the tooth now. I spent 10 min this morning just swishing ice cold water back and forth in my mouth in amazement. \\n\\n\\nTldr; I convinced myself a large amount of dental pain was normal as it got worse and worse over two years. When I finally did something about it l, it got better instantly.\\n\\n\\nEdit: I went to an endodontist. Some have pointed out that oral surgeon is a specific study and not a broader term like I thought it was. Obligatory \"this was two years ago\". My daughter was 4 at the time.\\n\\nMy daughter\\'s love of Bob Ross started in the womb. I had terrible insomnia throughout my pregnancy, and I would listen to Bob Ross painting tutorials each night to fall asleep. (At the time I thought it helped me sleep because it was essentially soothing background noise, but recently I\\'ve learned about ASMR and I realize that I am super susceptible to certain sounds, such as quiet calm voices, and the scratching of paint brushes and tools). Anyways, after my daughter was born, I continued to have a hard time sleeping-- this time because of a crying and demanding baby. So every night, I\\'d lay down in my bed with her next to me in the bassinet, and I\\'d play Bob Ross. As my daughter got older, she began to demand Bob Ross. We\\'d read a board book or two before bed, and then we\\'d watch one half hour tutorial. By the end of these videos, my daughter (and often myself) would be sound asleep. For years this routine has continued. It continued through my second pregnancy, and now with my second daughter as well. We watch Bob Ross EVERY. SINGLE. NIGHT. We\\'ve seen each and every Joy of Painting tutorial (all 403 episodes) multiple times.\\n\\nSome nights I might think my kids have fallen asleep during book time (we are past board books and onto chapter books now). But when I close the book and prepare to sneak out of their room inevitably one or both of them chirps up: \"Mama, what about Bob Ross?\" And so we watch Bob Ross.\\n\\nWhich brings me to the fateful day. After watching a particularly compelling episode of the Joy of Painting, my four year old sighed happily and said \"Mama, one day I\\'d like to go visit Bob Ross. Where does he live again?\" To which I replied \"Muncie, Indiana remember?\" \"Oh yes\" she said, recalling that Bob mentions Muncie frequently. And then....and to this day I still don\\'t entirely know why...I said these words: \"But honey, I have to tell you something. Bob Ross died a long time ago. We might be able to visit Muncie, but won\\'t be able to meet Bob\".\\n\\nAnd my daughter broke down completely.\\n\\nNow, like most parents, I\\'ve seen my kids cry. I\\'ve seen ALL their cries: when they are angry, hungry, scared, bored, whining, manipulating, you name it. But I had never heard her cry like this. She was completely and utterly bereft. She was wailing and punching herself in the chest and thighs while giant strangled sobs burst from her lungs. The news that her hero was dead just destroyed her.\\n\\nShe cried for a solid 20 minutes. My husband (helpfully) shouted up from the main floor of the house \"What the hell made you think that would be a good idea? Seriously, what possessed you to tell her that?\" And I couldn\\'t really answer except that I had felt in that moment that I shouldn\\'t lie to her. That I should tell her the truth about Bob Ross and that he wasn\\'t alive anymore.\\n\\nAfter she stopped crying we talked a lot about Bob Ross, how he died, and about his legacy. I told her about how Bob Ross gave a very important gift to the world, and that his own love of painting had inspired so many artists and people in every country. Even as a four year old with limited understanding of life and death, she seemed to find some solace in that. 1.5 years later she still brings up how Bob Ross made a lot of people happy, and how he makes her happy still.\\n\\nSo that\\'s my TIFU. My lovely 5.5 and 3 year old daughters will surely be demanding \"Bob Ross\" tonight, and as always I will oblige them.\\n\\nTL;DR: My young daughter loves Bob Ross. I told her that he was dead.\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nOh my goodness, this blew up.  I checked in right before I put my kids to bed and my eldest and I sat up and read some of the comments together. She particularly loved the Bob Ross Lego figurine someone shared (she is a big Lego fan) and thought one user\\'s story about their Mom becoming a professional painter after watching Bob Ross tutorials was \"really nice\".\\n\\nI also read the post itself to my daughter, and she smiled and chuckled along. When it got to the part where her Dad questioned my general parenting abilities she stopped to ask me \"why would Dad say that to you?\" and when I replied \"well, he thought I should\\'ve protected your feelings\" she said rather matter-of-factly \"You shouldn\\'t lie to children\". So I guess she agrees with my approach(?)\\n\\nSeveral people asked where you can find all the Bob Ross episodes, and the answer is Youtube! Check out the [Bob Ross channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxcnsr1R5Ge_fbTu5ajt8DQ).  Tonight my girls and I watched this [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoJ2tcXWb7g)).\\n\\nAnd finally to answer the question of  \"did I know that it was the 25th anniversary of Bob Ross\\' death today?\" No, I did not. That\\'s honestly blowing my mind a little bit, because I\\'ve been thinking about making this TIFU post for a few weeks, and it just so happens I finally sat down today and wrote it up.  I couldn\\'t remember the exact year he died until I looked it up on his Wiki entry today, and I totally glossed over the specific date. July 4th. What a weird weird coincidence.\\n\\nSecond update: Holy smokes. Almost 26,000 upvotes? I’m so pleased my FU resonated with so many. Thanks to the folks who gave me flair and gold; I’ve never made a post on Reddit that attracted much attention, haha. \\n\\nI seriously enjoyed all the funny, heartbreaking and relatable stories of the first time you experienced your own loss of a hero— Elvis, Michael Jackson, members of the Beatles, MLK, Mr. Rogers....thank you for your comments and I’ll continue to read them all.\\n\\nAnd finally thanks to everyone who shared their own stories of Bob Ross and the influence he had on their lives. It’s awesome that he continues to inspire so many people with his art tutorials, love of animals and nature, life advice and kindness 25 years after his death. The world is truly a better place because of him.\\n\\nIf anyone is looking for a good watch, [The Happy Painter](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MCwGOMloBPk) is on YouTube as is this gem [Where Are All the Bob Ross Paintings?](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rDs3o1uLEdU) I bought a fleshlight back in February of 2018, using it on and off again for about 3 months until I decided to box it up for good. I had had enough of the joy the toy brought me, and had just started a relationship with my now lovely girlfriend.\\n\\nFlash forward to yesterday, when I was looking through my old junk. I was bored and decided to do some (late) spring cleaning, when I came upon the box. I smirked and opened up the box to see my prized possession, the fleshlight. I put it aside for today, when I decided to use it. Out of lube, I went it dry, fuck up #1. Once I reached as far in as my lil member would let me in it, I felt a tickling sensation. Uneased I pulled out fast, giving my dick a rug burn type sensation. To my surprise, and disgust, I was met with a spider on the tip of my dick. Without thinking, I instantly flicked it off with my long ass fingernails, scraping the tip of my dick. In pain, I freaked out and let the spider get away.\\n\\nMy dick now hurts, and a spider is now loose in my house.\\n\\ntl;dr - stuck my dick in a unused fleshlight just to find a spider on my tip, hurting myself in the process of getting it off\\n\\n\\nEdit: threw out the toy, couldn’t get the image out of my head...\\n\\nEdit 2: found a spider in my room and killed it, hopefully it was the dick spider Before everyone freaks out - yes, I am on birth control. Also, apologies on format because of mobile blah blah.\\n\\nThis happened 30 minutes ago. I\\'m currently sitting in my car outside my gynecologist\\'s office typing this.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I both lead pretty busy lives. He works full time and often works overnight shifts. On the other hand, I\\'m a full time student that works 30-35 hours a week. On top of that, I had to put down my beloved fur child last Saturday, so as expected, he hasn\\'t really been putting his wand in my Chamber of Secrets..if you catch my drift.\\n\\nAfter an emotionally draining week, filled with lots tears and interspersed with sexual frustration, we finally had some time last night to, in Conan O\\'Brien\\'s words, \"take grandma to Applebee\\'s.\" It\\'s been a while since we had sex and my bf is not a fan of hand to gland combat, so unsurprisingly, he had a huge load.. As in, I felt his dick spasms as he shot ropes of jizz in me. When I was cleaning myself up after, I noticed just how much was coming out of me and when I told him he laughs it off and says,\" Haha, yeah, that was a lot.\"\\n\\nAnyways, this morning I check my calendar and of course I have a gyno appointment. I\\'m the type of person that gets really anxious for any type of appointment and while psyching myself out for my handsome and young male gyno to take a peek at my vagooba, I completely forget about last nights sexscapade. \\n\\nFast forward to the appointment and everything seems normal. I guess my gyno was training a Physician\\'s Assistant because she was the one that did my pap smear. \\n\\nFor the dudes reading this, a pap smear is when us ladies have to channel our inner Sasha Grey and lay on our backs with our legs spread wide open for our gynecologists\\' viewing pleasure. They then stick a speculum in, open up our love canals, and blindly stick a bristle-like swab in to take cultures. Ya know, nothing\\'s better than having a complete stranger stick random objects up your terrified vag while they try to hold a conversation with you - always a good time.\\n\\nAnyways, as she sticks the speculum in, her soft virgin eyes look mortified. My experienced gyno just carries on, asking me questions (keep in mind that he was not behind her but was to my left). Midway he stops, walks over to take a quick look, smirks, and goes,\" Do you finally have a bf?\" (It\\'s worth noting that he\\'s a really cool gyno and obviously, I must talk to him about my sex life every check up; at this point, I wasn\\'t sure if he had actually seen the semen inside me or was just making small talk). I awkwardly answer \"yes\" and he gives me his spiel about continuing my birth control/being careful. The new PA still looks semi-disgusted but has finished and is now pulling out the speculum. That\\'s the EXACT moment that my soul leaves my body. As she pulls it out to throw in the trash behind her, I see my boyfriend\\'s freaking baby batter DRIPPING off this thing into the floor. Once the speculum was removed, I proceed to feel a gush of liquid rush out of my pink canoe and pool around my butt. Yes, I was still spread eagle and you can bet that they both saw. \\n\\nThe poor PA looks at my gyno and asks,\" Did you want me to clean that?,\" referring to what dripped on the floor. Before he could answer, I made a strange ass sound and rushed out,\" It\\'s okay, I\\'ll do it.\"\\n\\nBefore they leave, my gynecologist winks at me and says,\" Guess your dry spell is finally over!\" We speak casually like friends so I\\'m not weirded out or anything but so embarrassed.\\n\\nGuys.. I am seriously fucking horrified. What the fuck. I\\'m seriously considering switching gyno\\'s but mine is so damn good at his job and we really get along. \\n\\nAlso, not using a throwaway because I have no shame.\\n\\nTL;DR: Boyfriend blew a huge load in me last night, went to the gynecologist today, and his cum literally gushes out of me.\\n\\nEDIT: For those of you suggesting that this is an April Fools joke.. it is unfortunately not. My dignity is in shambles but I’m glad a few of you were able to laugh, cry, and cringe with me.\\n\\nAlso, yes, I did shower. My after-sex routine always involves a shower where I proceed to push my pelvic floor muscles like I am a reborn Christian, trying to expel the demon spawn that my sinful boyfriend had pushed into me. Although a hefty amount DID come out last night, apparently, not all of it. Contrary to popular belief, cooter’s are not wide, gaping holes, with lips that flap whenever there\\'s a breeze. Washing the outside of your vagina does not clean the INSIDE which, if you\\'re not dipping your \\'nana into the Nutella jar, is where the semen goes. A pap smear looks at the inside of the vagina and a speculum is an instrument that basically spreads open the walls of your tight vagina so the gynecologist can get a better look at your cervix.\\n\\nIn my case, just like ~~Noah~~ Moses, that speculum split the waves and onto the path that was just formed, onward gushed my beloved boyfriend\\'s high fructose porn syrup. \\n\\nEDIT 2: For those that don\\'t believe this is true.. or that I am female (grrls don\\'t use the the interwebz hurrhurr), here are the screenshots of me talking to my boyfriend after. \\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/TwRHKGz\\n\\nEDIT 3: For those that STILL don\\'t believe me:\\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/yMZJvJK\\n\\nAlso, please don\\'t speak badly about my gynecologist. You may think it\\'s unprofessional but I\\'ve been seeing him for years now (prior to my bf, I was single for 3 years and I\\'m not one to partake in one night stands) and we\\'re really close. As part of a regular check up for STD screening, he always asked if I have engaged in any sexual activity and for three years, I\\'d say no then tell him how much I longed for a relationship. If this happened in one of our first appointments, he would have NEVER acted like this. I have PCOS/am high risk for cervical cancer so I am constantly there for testing, ultrasounds, and general check ups regarding birth control/Metformin/etc. (we\\'re still working on a method to regulate my period). He\\'s become really close to me and we always joke around because it eases my nerves. It took us a while to get as comfortable as we are with each other and I wouldn\\'t change it for the world. Though it\\'ll always be nerve wracking to see any kind of physician ESPECIALLY a gynecologist, for me, it really helps that I view him as a friend. \\n\\nTo clarify, bf and I had sex around 3am last night, I cleaned up, then we went to bed. Today (or I guess yesterday since it\\'s 12:33am right now), was my day off so I legitimately woke up and Netflixed in bed all day until around 1 pm since my appointment was at 2.\\n\\nBelieve me or not, that\\'s up to you. All I\\'m saying is I swear on my beloved fur baby\\'s soul that it happened and I am still super embarrassed. In the years that I\\'ve been his patient, I have never seen this young female PA before. I do not know if this was the first time she encountered a situation like this but from the look on her face, I can only guess. I\\'m sure she\\'ll become seasoned in time and things like this wil not phase her. The PA gave me my pap smear and I had to come back in a week to get an ultrasound for my PCOS anyway so if results were unclear due to semen, I\\'m sure we will redo the pap smear. My appointment was at 2pm but I was not seen until 3pm due to him having an emergency regarding a patient to attend to at the hospital so the exam was very rushed since he had a full waiting room. However, I\\'ll be sure not to have PiV sex for at least 48 hours prior (very thankful for this advice as I genuinely did not know and this was my first visit where I am in a relationship ever).\\n\\nI honestly was NOT expecting this to blow up like this in anyway.. I never even really post on Reddit, hence not using a throwaway since nobody knows I have this account *shrugs*. I guess this will become my \"throwaway\" account now since all this attention is making me a bit uncomfortable.\\n\\nSome of you are criticizing my writing style and that\\'s okay. I decided to have some fun with this post since it honestly was an awkward situation. I also happen to be a fan of euphemisms and personally challenged myself to use as many as I could. Sorry to those that felt it was hard to read or cringey and thanks to those that light heartedly laughed with me. I appreciate all of you - both the bad and good comments.\\n\\nIt was nice feeling semi-popular for one day, as things have been pretty gloomy around here ever since my dog died but some of your comments have really brightened my day. \\n\\nGoodnight Reddit! TL;DR at bottom, I waffled.\\n\\nI built my first ever PC around 3.5 years ago. It\\'s pretty budget but I thought for the £500 I was spending on parts, it would be pretty decent. So I follow a couple of youtube tutorials to build it and everything worked fine first try, to my absolute surprise. Over the course of the 3 years, I\\'ve never had one problem with it other than it was pretty slow and could only run games on low or medium at best, depending on the age of the game. It would take quite a long time to boot, and usually I\\'d have to let it \\'warm up\\' for a minute or so til I could open browsers or do stuff without apps crashing. Was not ideal to say the least.\\n\\nCut to 2 weeks ago, a friend was telling me about the new RAM he just got, which got me thinking about my lil ol\\' PC and how it\\'s 3 years old, and how it could maybe use a few cheap upgrades. The first thing I look at when I open up my PC is the 8GB stick of RAM (some of you may see where this is going) cause I only have 2 RAM slots, and he looked so lonely, so thought I\\'d look into a 2nd stick to keep him company. After a bit of RAM research, I started seeing the words \\'dual-channel\\' a lot, so delved a bit deeper. I read more and more about how people in similar situations to mine should have originally went with 2x4GB instead of 1x8GB if your motherboard supports dual-channel cause it\\'s magic (I\\'m reciting stuff I have no idea about, I could be wrong here) and that you should try and use the same manufacturer/frequency if you\\'re going to get multiple sticks. \\n\\nI found the same model of RAM on eBay for less than £30 a week or so ago, so I ordered it. It arrived today. I plugged it in and immediately thought I\\'d try and load up something that used to crash my PC hard: a large map on Rust. The large map, which previously suplexed my pc, loaded in faster than a small map used to with 1 stick of RAM, and was running at a solid 60fps while running around chopping stuff. No crashes, no screen tearing, just a working game. So, I redownloaded WoW which I haven\\'t played for a year or so, but I could only run it on medium graphics with sunshafts/shadows off if I wanted anywhere close to 60fps). I logged on and fiddled around with the settings and turns out my PC is capable of running the game on high, with sunshafts/shadows on high, at an unmoving 60fps. All it took was another stick of RAM to make my PC not a piece of shit. I\\'m in disbelief at how my PC is now like twice as good, and at how it now feels like I\\'ve been using half a PC for 3 years. I\\'m such an idiot.\\n\\nTL;DR Seemingly badly bottlenecked my PC by only using 1 stick of RAM instead of 2. It went from really shit to really not shit 3.5 years too late. I am idiot. My grandma died last year and grandpa’s tken it hard. Now he used to be the dirty old man sort of guy, so I thought getting him Nekopara Vol. 0 (A visual novel about catgirls) for Christmas would be nice.\\n\\nA few days ago, we met up at a wedding. I see my grandpa. He starts excitedly chatting with me about the game and I think, “I did a good thing” and tuned out the rambling.\\n\\nI shouldn’t have. We go back to my grandpa’s place.\\n\\nGrandpa: Here are the new decorations I have!\\n\\nMom: Dad, what is all this?\\n\\nGrandpa: Stuff from the game your magnificent son gave me!\\n\\nThe whole apartment was littered with Nekopara figurines, posters, merch and etc. He had a body pillow in his bedroom. Now my family looks down on me for converting my grandpa into the weebiest of weebs.\\n\\nI learned today through text he picked up Eromanga Sensei. God help his soul.\\n\\nTL;DR: I gave my grandad a copy of Nekopara. He went ape-shit and bought merch. My family now hates me for converting him into a degenerate.\\n\\nEdit: Oh my, this has blown up. This TIFU  just happened \\n\\nY’all, it’s been a long ass holiday weekend. \\nFrom cooking, to cleaning, to the kids being out of school since Wednesday. I’ve had little to no “me time”. So tonight, once the kids were tucked in bed, I decided to treat myself to a nice soak in the tub. \\nLet me tell y’all, that bitch felt amazing. I scrubbed and soaked and enjoyed. Then, I got up to shower to wash the weekend away. Am I the only weirdo who has to shower after a bath? \\nAs I grabbed the handheld shower to wash my nether regions, things were feeling pretty damn good. So I decided to linger there for awhile. I mean, hopefully no kids will try to barge in this late,and the hubs is watching YouTube videos on bowling, so he isn’t exactly turning me on big time at the moment. Perfect timing.\\nI was playing with the different massage jets and found the perfect pressure. \\nIt was about this time, I assume, my husband got up from his videos to start that load of laundry I’ve been asking him to do since noon.\\nHow do I know this?\\nBecause just as the pressure got oh so perfect, and my knees began to wobble, the lovely warm water on my lady bits turned to MOLTEN HOT LAVA. I was already hitting that big O so I couldn’t just jump out, I was too shaky. So my dumb ass just releases the lava hose, causing it to spray all over my shuddering legs. My right legs slips, I go down on one knee, and finally reach past the spray to turn off the faucet. \\nSo now I’m in bed, legs splayed, with my fan soothing my meat locker.\\n\\nTL;DR : Used shower head to get off, got burned\\n\\nEdit: Y’all. Gold, platinum? Front page? Wow, I’m humbled. Thanks.\\n\\nEdit 2: Husband has found front page. He is an amazing man and bowling is the coolest.\\n\\nEdit 3: More medals! Thank you! My inbox is a pretty full place but I’m doing my best to reply to all the nice ones. To those saying I’m good with words, thank you, that really means a lot to me. To those saying I made this up, I assure you I didn’t, but I can’t prove it so believe what you will. Lastly, no, I won’t be sending anyone photographic evidence of the aforementioned meat locker. tl;dr: Accidentally sent my gf the picture of the engagement ring, kept her from opening it, had to come up with a fake surprise to throw off her suspicions.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n  So this was actually a few months ago. I (24M) had just recently bought an engagement ring to propose to my at the time girlfriend (24F). I was on the phone with a good friend of ours to tell him the news, and wanted to send him the picture of the ring as a way of telling him while talking to him. \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n  So I put him on speaker phone and clicked into the text thread, attached the picture, and clicked send. Welp, it was immediately after clicking send that I noticed the texts in the thread didn\\'t look right. I looked up at the name at the top of the thread and my heart stopped: It was my gf. \"Shit\" I said over the phone. My friend asked what was wrong, and I told him I\\'d have to call him back. Tried finding a way to cancel the message to no avail.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n  As a last ditch effort, I called her, as the message did not yet say \"Delivered\". She answered the phone and I immediately said \"Do you see the message I just sent?\" \"Yeah...it says attachment, why?\" Immediately I blurted \"Dont open it! Just delete the thread. Please.\" \\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n  She sounded concerned, and asked \"Is this something I should be worried about? You\\'re kinda scaring me lol\". \"No, no,\" I said, \"I just have a little surprise for you I was trying to show someone and don\\'t want to ruin the surprise.\" She relented, but still seemed (naturally) very suspicious. \"Ok, I deleted it. Didn\\'t look at it.\" I know your first thought might be that she looked anyway, but I can 100% promise you that girl would never, ever lie to me. The 1 or 2 times I ever tried to tell a little fib to skirt around something (usually just not wanting to get nagged about something) she was highly upset about it and demanded complete honestly between us. It\\'s just not in her to lie, and she\\'s honestly terrible at it (ie: trying to keep anything as a surpise for me she cannot hide it to save her life).\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n  So I had avoided the disaster of her seeing the ring, but now I had her HIGHLY suspicious of me, and needed a way to throw her off the scent. So I immediately went and found a cute little necklace on Etsy I knew she\\'d like, and bought it and had it shipped to her house. Later that week she got it and texted me, saying I was very sweet and she loved my surprise. Phew. A few weeks later I actually managed to pull off a surprise proposal against all odds, since she had been telling friends for a bit she suspected I was going to propose. Despite all of this, she was completely surprised when her \"girls\\' day\" with her bff ended with me proporsing at the waterfall near her house, and we came home to a surprise party with our parents and friends to celebrate.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n  When I told her about what that text really was and how I covered my tracks, she laughed, rolled her eyes, and called me an idiot. She was impressed with how I improvised and threw her off track lol. We\\'re getting married next October :)\\n\\nEdit: pics from the proposal/ring :)\\n\\n\\n\\n[Proposal](https://www.reddit.com/user/sshep49/comments/ch0bnl/proposal/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)\\n\\n[Ring](https://www.reddit.com/user/sshep49/comments/ch0br8/ring/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) Literally happened a half hour ago.\\n\\nHusband and I have been together 15 years.  We are both open minded and confident when it comes to sex so there is little we haven\\'t done and we love it all.  Nothing is gross or weird with us when we\\'re getting off.\\n\\nHe asked me to help wax his balls a few days ago.  I did.  Unfortunately the one section of skin came off with the wax strip.  It was about the size of a quarter but he\\'s tough and didn\\'t complain.\\n\\nI walk out of the master bathroom to find him jerking off.  He\\'s not home 90% of the year because of work so I, of course, wanted to help him despite staying up late drinking and fucking and therefore worrying the motion of a blow job or getting fucked might make me nauseous which would ruin the mood.  I thought \"I\\'ll lick his perfect balls and help by applying pressure to the base of his dick right under his balls\".  \\n\\nHe\\'s loving it.  I\\'m loving licking and sucking and cradling his balls, independently and simultaneously, in my mouth.\\n\\nI feel something as I\\'m making circles with my tongue.  No big deal whether it\\'s hair or lint whatever so I quickly pull my finger and thumb up to retrieve the foreign, unknown object.  As I pluck it off my tongue (trying not to miss a beat of our quality time) I glance at it.  It\\'s grey and slimy, bunched up and longer than my longest fingernail.  It took a half a second to realize that I had literally sucked the scab off my husband\\'s balls.  \\n\\nTL;DR - Exfoliated husband\\'s balls with my mouth. So several years ago my best mate todd changed his name in my phone too \"sexy jess from work\" and then would ring my phone in the middle of the niggt to try and get me in trouble with my partner. But she was friends with him before we had even gotten together so she recognized his number and his prank didnt really  work out.\\n\\nFast forward 6 or 7 years to the weekend just passed.\\nIm sitting on the couch watching tv and my partner is upstairs my 8 year old daughter is bored so i give her my phone to play a game on.\\n\\nQue fuck up.\\nI never changed todds name back. Its been a running joke between us for years.\\nSo \"sexy jess from work\" calls whilst my daughter has  my phone. She freaks out. Comes running into the lounge room crying throws my phone at me and screams \"i hate you dad!\". She runs off upstairs.\\nSo im sitting there really confused. After a few seconds i follow her upstairs. I can hear her crying then i hear my partner start laughing hysterically.\\nNow im really confused. I get to the bedroom. My partner just  holds up my phone showing a missed call from \"sexy jess from work\". I piece together whats happened and spend the next 20 minutes explaining to my daughter and calming her down then call todd back to tell hin how his joke has made it to the next generation.\\n\\nTldr : buddy saved his name in my phone too \"sexy jess from work\" several years ago as a joke. Today my daughter sees it freaks out and thinks im cheating on hwr mother.\\n\\nSorry for formatting on mobile.\\n\\n\\nEdit. Wow this blew up.\\n\\nSo yes my daughter threw my phone at me. Then picked it up and took it with her upstairs.\\n\\nIm Australian. My daughter is in grade 4 and is quite intelligent. Yes she knows what sexy is and yes she knows what cheating is.\\n\\nSorry for the spelling and lack of grammar, im lazy. So, my 6 year old often likes to make up his own prayers at night time and it\\'s adorable.  \\n\\nSo,  tonight,  he was kneeling at his bed in his jammies looking so cute I could just eat him.  \\n\\n\\nHim: \"Dear lord Jesus, please watch over me as I sleep tonight. Please look over mommy and daddy and teachers and friends too and the friends I haven\\'t met yet. \\n\\nThank you for dinner and inventing minecraft ...\"\\n\\n*I chuckle lightly*\\n\\nHim: *turning to me angrily* \"IT\\'S NOT FUNNY!!\"\\n\\nMe: \"I\\'m sorry sweetie, I won\\'t do it again\"\\n\\nHim: *resuming his prayer* \"And please don\\'t let my toys come alive tonight. Amen\"\\n\\nAnd he hopped into bed. \\n\\nMy stifled laugh sounded like a loud pig snorting, so I just layed my face down in his blankets and pretended like I was praying deeply as I tried to compose my self. \\n\\nThen I got up quickly trying to hide my face, and I sneaked one last look to say good night as I shut the door and he was giving me the death glare. \\n\\n\\n\\nEdit: Thank you so much for the likes, comments,  gold and silver!  I really didn\\'t think it was going to make it to the front page ! \\n\\nI actually thought it was going to get removed or downvoted because of our religion! I didn\\'t realize so  many people have such hate towards people who believe in a higher power! 😥 It convinces me to keep teaching my son to love and to show respect to everyone no matter what they believe in. \\n\\n I had a lot of fun reading everyone\\'s comments.  They were very funny.  I am very Thankful!😊😊\\n\\nThis is the cute little guy with his mama!\\n\\nhttp://imgur.com/a/GrVLYpl\\n\\n\\nTL;DR. My son prayed asking Jesus to not have his toys come alive,  I tried to hide my laugh and he gave me the death glare.\\n! 12 hours before my first “grown up job” interview, I was sent a drug test permission form which stated it was to be done on company’s grounds. Considering I smoke weed daily I started looking up ways to pass a drug test. I came to the conclusion that I was going to need some clean pee, a small container, and a way to keep it body temperature. I had clean pee and an off brand 5 hour energy bottle (they’re just a tad wider) but needed temperature strips to monitor the temperature. \\n\\nUnfortunately I was unable to obtain any temperature strips in the time I had to prepare, but knowing that I wouldn’t be able to pass if the temperature wasn’t correct I had the idea to stick it up my vagina. I tested it the night before and even tied a string to it so I could pull it out with ease and everything worked great.\\n\\nFast forward to the interview.\\nIt was an hour and a half away so I decided to wait till I got there to insert it. I did it in my car w some coconut oil before I walked in just Incase they decided to drug test me first. I walked in and everything was fine, I signed in and they told me to take a seat. As soon as I sat down I knew something was wrong. I went to the bathroom to make sure I could still take it out. I began pulling on the strings but the bottle didn’t move. I tugged again and the string broke. At this point I’m freaking out. I try getting it out with my fingers but I can’t reach it. The only “tools” I have on me are a mechanical pencil and a pen. So in a 3 piece suit and heels, I squat and begin to use these “tools” to try and remove the bottle. About 4 min go by and I’m really freaking out but need to go back Incase they called my name. I walk out and the HR rep sees me and asks if I’m okay. I tell her I have a tampon stuck up my vagina that I can’t get out and that’s why I’m freaking out. She then takes me to the nurse and tells me that hey she can remove it for me! Not wanting the target nurse to pull a bottle of pee out of me, I ask her if I can just try again myself, she says sure and hands me tweezers. Obviously that didn’t work. So she then gives me these scissors with a hook at the end and a disinfectant wipe... Still didn’t work. At this point I just have to do the interview. It lasted 3 hours and I had to take a tour of a 900,000 sq ft distribution center. \\n\\nWhen the interview finally ends I rush to the closest urgent care where I have to explain to the doctors why there’s a 5 hour energy in my vagina. At this point I’m convinced I just don’t have the right tools and they’ll get it out in no time. Upon looking, the doctor informs me that not only is it lodged behind my pelvic bone, but that it’s also sideways. Her first idea is to drill a hole into the bottle IN MY VAGINA and then fish it out. ~Luckily~ they just sent me to the ER instead. \\n\\nSo now I’m at the ER where they then inform me that since it’s behind my pelvic bone getting it out would mean essentially birthing a 5 hour energy bottle, but since I wasn’t actually giving birth my body wasn’t dilated and they couldn’t remove the bottle without putting me under.  \\n\\nWell, after 8 hours of having a 5 hour energy bottle lodged in my person, it was finally removed.\\nI didn’t get the job and I didn’t even get drug tested. \\n\\nTLDR: tried to pass a drug test by sticking a 5 hour energy bottle filled w clean pee in my vagina. After 8 hours, an urgent care visit, and a trip to the ER it was finally removed\\n\\nEdit: this isn’t made up. Idk if I have all the “anatomy” right I guess? Yes it was very painful. Yes, I have pictures and medical paperwork for people who don’t believe me\\n\\nI’m just telling you guys what the doctors told me. They might have just told me a dumbed down version without the right medicinal terminology, idk\\n\\n\\nI’m at work rn so this is all the proof I have for the moment lol \\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/gif/comments/bbd2n7/some_proof/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app\\n\\nPt 2\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Whatcouldgowrong/comments/bbdzwe/some_proof_pt_2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app\\n\\nDeleted proof 3 bc I was getting a lot of harassment. I still don’t think a doctors name is confidential but whatever As the title says I did exactly this. My stomach was having a particularly raunchy morning after consuming both dairy and gluten in the same meal and my body had made the decision to cancel all plans for the next hour as I’d be glued to the toilet for fear of shitting my brains out. As I finished up feeling much better off than I was when I sat down, I decided it was time to wash up and set the bidet to low but as I did this the pressure started dropping and I can’t get a good clean in with no pressure. So, I gradually turned it up till it began to return to normal, which just so happened to be at max. Sat there for maybe 2 or 3 seconds and almost as soon as I’d turned it to max, the pressure returned screaming for vengeance and plowed a hole through my anus and power washed my colon leaving me too stunned to scream and scrambled to shut the damn thing off. All the while I was barely able to keep my ass down so the water wouldn’t spray all over the bathroom. I sat there for maybe 30 seconds collecting myself when I felt a deep sloshing and rushing feeling like a trapped fart finally making its escape. I prepared for this thing to rip me half as it exited but I was so very unprepared. This supposed fart ended up being a stream of water that turned on my butthole on like a bath faucet and proceeded to shit straight water for about 40 seconds while I could only sit there helpless and wait for the endless stream of water rushing out of crev to stop. Once I was all finished up I skipped the toilet paper and went right to a bathroom towel as everything in the bowl at this point was dripping wet from the raw power of uncontrolled water pressure. Anyways two hours later now and I still am not able to trust farts and my turds are about as solid as trumps case for reelection. \\n\\nTL;DR Cranked the bidet up to 11 when the pressure started dropping and gave myself a enema when it returned\\n\\nEDIT: Can’t thank everyone for all the awards, so this is my thanks\\n\\nEDIT 2: Seen a lot of “what’s the bidet” or something like that and it’s a HelloTushy, great bidet though The time has come. I’ve made it. I’m writing this from the break room shaking and humiliated. Not only did this FU happen today, it happened within the last hour. I don\\'t see my therapist again until Friday, so you get to hear about it instead.\\n\\nI work in a customer-facing position in a small office. Today’s just a regular Monday. Talking to customers, preparing their work orders, finishing their paperwork, all sorts of small stuff. At time being, I have three customers sitting in my waiting area.\\n\\nThe most recent addition to our quiet morning waiting room, we’ll call her Jan, has been here before. Or rather, her family has a customer history with us - it’s my first time meeting her. The name on their account is Hank Junts and I feel like I’ve met him before. I *know* that I\\'ve met him before. I browse through their history and they have extensive records, but for the life of me I cannot place his face.\\n\\nAfter about ten minutes of idle clicking, I decide to search his name on Google with the name of our city.\\n\\n>“Beloved Softball Coach Hank Junts passes away in tragic fire.” \\n\\nHeadline from a local news station.\\n\\n*Oh my god. Maybe that’s why I’ve never met her before. Maybe he always came in instead of her.*\\n\\nThe article is dated December of last year.\\n\\n*Jeeze, it probably has been that long since I\\'ve seen him, hasn’t it. Oh how tragic.* Jan is probably only in her 40s or so. \\n\\nI wonder if I should say anything.\\n\\nBut I don’t have to say anything. I would credit Satan with the creation of auto-play videos on news articles, but Satan never did anything so heinous.\\n\\n**In tragic news, Hank Junts, softball coach at Smith Middle School, passed away as a result of a house fire last night.**\\n\\nAt full volume - echoing through the small room like a bird that got trapped inside, bouncing and flitting around uncatchable. I cannot catch it. The bird has knocked a vase onto Mrs. Junts’ head. The bird has knocked me on my ass. There is a bird in my throat and it feels like my mouth is full of feathers.\\n\\n*oh my god oh my god oh my god.*\\n\\n**no no no.**\\n\\nI frantically scroll trying to find the video player. Fuck. Found it. Pause pause pause pause pause you piece of shit.\\n\\n*Oh yeah, that’s what he looks like.*\\n\\nJan looks up at me. I look up at Jan. The Earth crackles and groans as the floor beneath me opens and swallows me whole.\\n\\nNo, I’m not that lucky. I stammer something about being so sorry for her loss and run to the break room, where I now sit red-faced and horrified. I can hear her on her cell phone. She is crying. I am crying. I fucked up and just ruined my customer\\'s day and have a new addition to the file of Horrible Things To Think About Right As I Fall Asleep.\\n\\ntldr: Couldn’t remember what a customer looked like, wound up with a news clip loudly autoplaying how the customer died in a house fire - and I played it all of ten feet from his widow.\\n\\n--\\n\\nedit: okay I hate edits but now I understand why people do them. our FAQ of the day - no, my keyboard unfortunately does not have a volume button and I do try to keep my computer on mute. for what it\\'s worth (i.e. not much at this fuckin point), the only reason it wasn\\'t muted was because I was showing someone a coworker a video while we were opening. and yes, I probably shouldn\\'t have done that either. \\n\\nthere\\'s a lot of love/hate about the bird thing. thank you for the compliments. if you said something mean I hope a real life non-metaphorical bird poops right on your head.\\n\\nas far as what I\\'m going to do next. Mrs. Junts is coming back into the office next Monday so I\\'m planning on talking to her in person then. thankfully I have a some days to practice because tbh, even though logically I know it was an innocent mistake, it still feels awful and it\\'s hard to think about facing her. my coworker said she seemed okay when she left. and yes, I know that it was probably a mistake to run away but if I had any good judgement about any of this I wouldn\\'t have a reason to post here in the first place.\\n\\nadding another edit because my selfloathing knows no bounds. No, those are not their real names. I\\'m pretty dumb but I like to think I\\'m not *that* dumb. So obligatory this actually did happen today.\\n\\nToday I was browsing tinder and came across one of those \"I don\\'t use this, add me on SC\" accounts, was feeling bored and horny and decided to add them. After they accepted my FR on Snapchat, I sent her a \"so how much, and what am I getting?\" message. She tells me its $40 for some videos and her venmo and I decide, fuck it, I\\'d like to see some of that.\\n\\nAfter sending her the money, she proceeds to send me the videos, (pretty nice btw) and she asks what I think of them. I tell her she looks very sexy and she then sends me a message \"I\\'m kinda new to this. Tips are really appreciated.\"\\n\\nSo I took this as \"Oh, she\\'s new to selling her body on the internet, I should be constructive and try to help a new entrepreneur.\"\\n\\nI then proceed to spend the next 10 minutes going over her good points, things I think she could improve, specifically things like, \"You have really nice boobs, but I think you\\'re overemphasizing them. You should try different positions, etc.\"\\n\\nAfter sending all of these messages, she responds, \"Oh. I meant tips as in like donations, but thanks anyways!\"\\n\\nCue me fucking dying inside.\\n\\ntl;dr A premium snapchat girl asked me for money and I gave her advice on how to better sell her body on the internet. First, English is not my first language and this shameful moment happened a while ago at University in France.\\n\\nMy professor was a prominent teacher in a specific science area. From his look and what he told us about his personal life, you could guess he was a very religious family guy, quite inhibited, and definitely not the kind of making jokes.\\n\\nDuring his classes, students were used to prepare talks about specific topics or to send him reports. So part of our homework had to be written while the other part had to be oral.\\n\\nSo that day, he introduced a new project that we’ll have to prepare for the following week. But he didn’t specify which kind. So the ~~stupid~~ naive younger version of myself genuinely asked him:\\n\\n**Me -** \"Excusez-moi Professeur X, voulez-vous un rapport écrit ou un rapport oral?\" *-->* Translation **COULD mean**: \"Excuse-me Professor X, would you like a written report or an oral report?\" (*Nothing crazy, huh? but definitely not what everyone understood. Real meaning further in the text)*\\n\\n**Prof X -** *staying silent and starting to blush*\\n\\n**The whole classroom -**  *bursting and laughing so much*\\n\\n**Me -** *turning around to my classmates confused to see what funny thing I missed then going back to my professor* \"Mr X, you didn\\'t answer to my question. Would you like an oral report?\"\\n\\n**Prof X -** *still silent and blushing even more* \\n\\n**The whole classroom -**  l*aughing louder*\\n\\n**Me -** *More and more confused of what was so hilarious then I repeat in my mind the question I was about to ask once again because damnit I want to know what freaking kind of project he was asking us! And this is when I realize what terrible thing I\\'ve just said out loud. I was so ashamed that I instantly got the same skin condition as my professor. But it  was so funny that I ended up crying from laughing.*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**THE EXPLANATION:**\\n\\n\"Rapport écrit\" means \"written report\" and by opposition \"Rapport oral\" would literally mean \"oral report\" ONLY if you translate word by word.\\n\\nBut in French, the real common comprehension for \"rapport oral\" is BLOWJOB and that\\'s what EVERYONE understood!!! \\n\\nNo you can re-read my conversation and replace oral report by blowjob. \\n\\nYes you can make fun of me, I deserve it! \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**TLDR:** During class, I thought I was asking to my teacher what kind of homework we had to do but instead I asked him if he wanted a blowjob. This happened two days ago, and though the consequences of said FU have subsided, the lessons I learned along the way will stay with me, forever.\\n\\nI love bad food, and therefore have to run in order to eat said food without ballooning to immense proportions. On Saturday, I decided to do a long-ish run, as I was going out for my daughter\\'s birthday, and her favorite restaurant is an all-you-can-eat place nearby our house. So, donning my cold-weather outdoor running gear, I set off on a jog, noticing that I had forgot to put on the compression underwear that I normally run with. No matter, I thought-I had sweats on and even though it was ~28 F, I was warm enough and knew that I would warm up after I started on the run.\\n\\nAbout halfway through I had to pee, but it subsided after about 5-6 minutes, so I figured my body just said \"eh take care of it when you get home.\" About ten minutes after that, I realized I could no longer feel much down there, and the tip of my penis was completely without feeling. Worrisome, I thought, so I turned my back to the road, took off my glove, and put my hands down there to investigate. It was cold as ice, and I couldn\\'t feel anything. Turns out, not wearing underpants had made the tip of the penis spend most of its time in direct contact with my sweats, which weren\\'t rated to any sort of weather conditions (they were just my usual ratty lounge pants). So, between the sweat from the warm parts of my legs and the tip of the penis being essentially uncovered to the elements...\\n\\nI ran back to the house as fast as I could, all the while worrying that at some point that day, I would see a doctor, who would pull down his mask, use words like \"frostbite,\" \"amputation,\" and \"shockingly small,\" and I would have no choice but to be a eunuch. Once I got home, I stripped down and got into the bathroom to take a warm shower (I probably should have looked up the proper way to go about unfreezing a penis, but my mind was elsewhere). I cannot really describe the intense pain that ensued as my penis thawed, but I thought I was going to pass out. It took roughly an hour (the worst part of which was the first 5 or so minutes) to get \"normal\" feeling back, and as far as I can tell, everything is working properly as of now.\\n\\nStill, the moral of the story- WEAR UNDERPANTS. They might just save your penis (if you have one).\\n\\nTL:DR went for a run in below-freezing weather, forgot to wear underpants, froze penis, had to re-thaw penis and it was exceptionally painful.\\n\\nEdit: I am so happy that my (possibly small) frozen penis is making some internet friends have a good laugh. Thanks for reading! And thank you, truly, for the gold and silver, I am honored that it made a few folks chuckle enough to go the extra mile. Stay safe out there, and keep your junk warm if you have it!\\n\\nEdit edit: It\\'s the squiggly line, not a minus sign, in front of the 28F. So, it was JUST below freezing, not 28 degrees below freezing. I don\\'t mind running in the cold, but 28 below would be truly insane. Obligatory: This didn\\'t happen today. Also TLDR at the end.\\n\\nContext : I am from India. I never exactly received a sex talk from my parents \\n\\nWhen I was 14, I had noticed there was a small lump of skin in my scrotum just above my nuts. I was so dumb, that I thought that was the formation of a new testicle. I had had recently seen a news clippings with a woman who had 3 breasts. So I thought it would be applicable for guys as well. So the dumb me decided that I should wait it off and see the \"third testicle\" grow. I also thought that this would be a sign of virility. \\n\\nFast forward 1.5 years, the lump became bigger and oddly shaped and it would pain a lot sometimes. At that time I had recently read about cancer in school. Now I had convinced myself that the lump was actually a tumor. That started freaking me out a lot. I used masturbate a lot, so I believed that that was the reason this was caused. Since I never talked to my parents about my masturbation habits, I was too shy to talk to my parents about it. The tumor would retract back into my abdomen some times. One time when I actually mustered the courage to talk to my parents about it, it had retracted back. They assumed that the pain was being caused because of my testicles descending. So I also ignored it and prayed that the tumor would just go away. \\n\\nFew years went by and I tried to ignore my tumor as much as possible. Once I read an article about cysts, and I believed that that swelling could also be a cyst. Whenever I\\'d read about a new swelling or tumor, I\\'d just believe that that\\'s what I had.\\n\\nWhen I started college and moved to a dorm, I would try everything possible for people to not see me naked. The tumor had become ugly, but it was was of a constant size now. I just assumed that my body was abnormal and I couldn\\'t do anything about it. \\n\\nFast forward to this year (currently 21), I had to come back to my home because of COVID. One day I was changing my clothes after taking a shower. My brother accidentally walked into me changing my clothes. He saw my crotch and was ridiculously surprised at what that monstrosity was. That was the first time I confessed about my crotch issues to anyone. After having this tumor for so long, I was more ashamed that being an adult, I wasn\\'t able to come clean about a medical issue I was facing. My brother nudged me for a few days and forced me to talk to my parents about this issue. I finally caved in and talked to my father about this. He took me to the doctor the next day. I was nervous that the doctor would be shocked and I would be diagnosed with stage four cancer or something. Turns out it was just a hernia. Apparently as the doctor has speculated, this hernia was caused because my muscles were weak and the gap created when the testes descend didn\\'t seal properly causing the hernia. I got my surgery scheduled within a few days. I got a laparoscopy to treat my hernia. It\\'s been 1.5 months since my surgery. I\\'ve made great recovery since. \\n\\nI\\'ve wasted over 6-7 years of my life overthinking and living with discomfort because of my hernia. \\n\\nTLDR: I didn\\'t get my hernia checked up on time and ended up having body image issues for almost 5 years. Link to original post. \\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/aalqdq/tifu_buying_a_23_and_me_kit_assuming_my_history/?st=JR8FCIB4&sh=3508d64a\\n\\nSo when all this went down, my sister and I asked my mom to take a DNA test as well. She agreed. As it turns out, my mom is not my biological mom. As I said before, it makes no difference to me because my mom is my mom no matter what. \\n\\nHERE IS THE KICKER THOUGH\\n\\nMy mom was wholeheartedly under the impression her eggs were used in her IVF treatment. She is contacting her doctor who is still in practice to figure out what the hell this means. \\n\\nI’m actually sort of sad for my mom, I didn’t consider this as an option in the realm of possibility. We are her daughters of course but I can’t imagine finding out at her age with adult kids that your biological line actually ends with you. \\n\\nSo yeah, guess that’s all I have for now!\\n\\nTLDR; Mom is not my mom and she is more shocked than I am. \\n\\nEDIT: I talked to my mom this morning and she’s ok, thank goodness. She said we’re still her babies! I discussed the idea of hiring a lawyer with her, she said she still has her IVF paperwork somewhere so she is looking for it. Her paper hoarding may come in handy this once! I’m just happy she is alright. This happened last night, but the scars will last a while. My ex husband and I are close friends. He\\'s out of town, so he asked me to house sit and take care of his dogs. I got here yesterday, got some work done on my latest project, and decided to end the day with a nice relaxing soak in the whirlpool tub. I wiped the tub down, filled it with piping hot water, added salts and a few drops of essential oils. I lit candles and poured a glass of champagne. It was beautiful. I lowered myself into the tub slowly, sank down, and sighed in happiness. Then I turn on the jets to kick everything off. I learned back, and for a few brief moments, I was in heaven. Then I opened my eyes. There were black slugs swimming in my bath. Hundreds of them. It was horrifying. I screamed like a banshee and dove out of the tub, falling to the floor. In my panic I knocked the wine glass off the tub ledge, shattering it. Now I\\'m naked on the floor, wet and covered in broken glass. The tub jets are still on, and now spraying the entire room with water. After managing to grip the counter and haul my ass up off the floor, I see that I have little cuts all over my legs, hands, and abdomen. Now the dogs are roused, and they are barking and jumping at the door. I tried to get ahold of myself enough to open the door, but as I do so, the largest dog pushes through, knocking me BACK on to the broken glass, so at this point I now have to do what I can to keep the dogs from getting hurt. After a moment or 2 of total panic, I get the dogs out again. When I look into the tub, I realize there are no slugs, but apparently my ex hasn\\'t cleaned the tub jets in a looooong time, because it is absolutely full of big pieces of the disgusting shit that builds up in tub jets. Big black pieces of that horrid mix of dead skin, oils, bacteria, and other delightful residues. I honestly think slugs might be LESS gross. So instead of relaxing, I spent the night cleaning and picking glass out of my wounds. Oh, and the dogs are fine, btw. \\n\\nTL;DR...I took a bath in a whirlpool that wasn\\'t as clean as it looked. I saw a thousand gross black slugs things floating around, panicked, dove out of the tub and ended up covered in broken glass and cuts This happened yesterday. My brother passed away in an accident a few months ago, he was only 35. Needless to say, it was - and still is - a huge trauma to all of us. My 6 years old nephew wanted to play a game in my brother´s (his father) phone, sister-in-law was ok with it, so I let him. All of the sudden, I hear him doing a monologue... went to check up on him. He was clicking on family member´s pictures and making calls. A few moments later, people started to message me saying they almost had a heart attack. Some didn´t have the balls to answer... my sister had to leave a work meeting because she started to shake. They were scared. They were surprised. The best was people´s description of the moment they picked up the phone and saw my brother´s name on the screen, thinking he was calling from the beyond. We all had a good laugh.\\n\\nMandatory edit:\\n\\nThank you for the gold.\\n\\n\\nThank you for the condolences.\\n\\n\\nMy brother´s phone line is still active, it´s in a family plan...  I won\\'t be pestering my sister-in-law about this, she is having a hard time already and if this isn´t a issue for her, I sure won´t create one.  \\n\\nTL;DR: Family freaked out thinking my deceased brother was calling them, instead it was my nephew using his phone.   I worked for a Workman\\'s Compensation provider some time ago and there was a guy in my department - Todd - who was mildly annoying.  Nice enough guy, but just a bit juvenile.  He enjoyed pranks and was always trying to get a rise out of everyone in the office.  Little things like taping our computer mouse or asking ransom for the return of our coffee cup. It got to be enough, so I decided he needed some payback.\\n\\nHe paid out a claim that was HUGE and he was nervous about it. I don\\'t know why, but it just seemed like an opportunity to me, and so I waited. About a week later, in a team meeting (everyone was in on it but Todd), I said that there were some payouts that were kicked upstairs for review and that it was a potentially serious situation.\\n\\nA couple of days after that, I stopped and poked my head into his office and asked, \"Did you payout x-amount on the Smith file?\" He said he had and asked me why. I just walked away.\\n\\nThe following Monday, I had my plan laid out fairly well.  After sharing the detail with my brother-in-law, he suggested that I borrow his black surplus Impala cop-car and park it at the entrance. Then, early that morning, I went about putting crime scene tape across the door to Todd\\'s his office.\\n\\nI had the receptionist in on it too. When Todd came in that morning, she would look at him, then fumble for the phone, turn her back and mumble into the receiver.\\n\\nTodd made it to the top of the steps when I rushed up to him and said, \"Dude - go, just go!\"\\n\\n\"What the hell are you talking about?\" He asked.\\n\\n\"Just turn around and leave - drive, drive anywhere, just go!\"\\n\\nHe shrugged me off, but I could tell that he was a little rattled. He turned the corner to see his office door blocked with crime scene tape and for a moment, he froze in his tracks. He walked past his office and around the corner, out of sight. He ended up slipping out through the stairwell.\\n\\nHe was gone for nine hours. I had to call his wife to get a message to him that it was a joke.\\n\\nHis absence meant that management got involved. I had to confess to being the perpetrator of the prank. I got a stern talking-to (my boss was trying really hard not to laugh) and I lost a vacation day as a result, but it was worth it.\\n\\nTodd doesn\\'t tape my mouse anymore.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR  I played a practical joke on a colleague and he took it seriously This happened just a couple days ago, it\\'s not the end of the world but it caught me off guard in an embarrassingly funny way.\\n\\nTL;DR: I accidentally cursed due to being absent minded, my daughter\\'s reply made me feel all sorts of different ways lol\\n\\nMy daughter just turned 3, her communication skills are getting better by the day. So that day for some reason her tummy was giving her issues so she was being difficult about eating. It was a cycle of her saying she was hungry, then a little back and forth about what is going to be eaten, and finally her taking one bite and saying she was done. Not even saying there was a problem, literally \"cool this was good, I\\'m full for the next 3 minutes\".\\n\\nAfter applesauce, PB & J, and pasta being prepared for no reason, I got the third \"all done!\" 30 seconds after dropping the plate with her, and I got a little frustrated.\\n\\nReal quick side note, I try to not give my daughter too much of the \"baby talk\" as in I don\\'t like having to dumb things down if it\\'s unnecessary, especially because I\\'m bilingual so there\\'s a whole other layer of development that I gotta be mindful of when I freely swap languages. So I try to keep it fairly down to earth if I can, to help her in the long run, unless we are playing or some other situation where I would be in character.\\n\\nANYWAY... So I\\'m a little frustrated and I\\'m in casual mode so after the third failed meal I slip up and I go \"oh come on man, are you fucking with me?\" And without missing a beat she goes \"no. I\\'m not fucking with you.\" and it just kinda stopped me in my tracks lol it was supposed more of a comment I mumbled to myself, but she fed it right back to me and I kinda wanted to laugh but also kinda felt embarrassed for it, while also having to   let her know that I\\'d prefer if she didn\\'t say that for reasons. \\n\\nYeah I know, it\\'s not all that crazy, but I thought it was kinda noteworthy one way or another and couldn\\'t think of a better sub to share it on.\\n\\nEdit: this blew up, holy shit, I was just casually sharing a story, didn\\'t think it would get this popular. There are way too many comments for me to be able to look at all of them lol This one literally just happened a couple hours ago. I\\'m getting over covid and have lost a ton of weight, like a shocking amount. I still have no sense of taste and what I can only describe as a strong aversion to food. My quarantine officially ended yesterday and I am allowed to go out again so I decided to walk to the gas station near my apartment and see if some doritos and a real coke would excite me. \\n\\nStrolling along, feeling pretty great about being alive and having energy again. I was quite sick but now I\\'m just bored and energetic, let\\'s take a walk, right?! Relevant to note here that I was a healthy weight before but it was a curvy lady healthy weight, now I just look like a titless, assless twig. I\\'m wearing a casual dress because it\\'s formless and so still fits. \\n\\nI was feeling pretty great and kinda skip-hopped up over the curb and MY UNDERWEAR FELL DOWN AROUND MY ANKLES. THEY FELL OFF MY ASS BECAUSE MY ASS IS GONE.\\n\\nA car was driving by and definitely saw. What do you even do in this situation? Kick them off and flee? Pull them up? I opted for the latter.\\n\\nTl;dr I got covid and didn\\'t die and then my underwear fell down in public.\\n\\nEdit: I am so thankful for all of your covid stories, and high five to my stranger-friends who have also had it and recovered! I\\'m also really, really happy that 15k people are laughing as hard as I am about the time I lost my underpants. Reddit is fantastic. Obligatory this didn\\'t happen today but a few weeks ago. Also I\\'m on mobile blah blah. \\n\\nI\\'m not very good at using Snapchat for it\\'s intended purpose but I like to post dumb videos of my two dogs being cute or goofy. I especially like to use the filter that makes glitter or stars sparkle across the screen. \\n\\nSo a few weeks ago the hubby and I are just chilling in the bed, petting our Pomeranian. He had just gotten out of the shower and it\\'s a hot day so he\\'s just chilling, legs spread, with his Jurassic Pork out.\\n\\nPancake (our pom) starts rooting into the blanket and being adorable, so I whip out my phone and start to record on Snapchat. I get a few seconds and do a quick zoom into her face because it\\'s hilarious. Then I post it to my story, send a copy to my husband and close the app. \\n\\nAbout an hour later he picks up his phone and starts to scroll. I\\'m not really paying attention to him and it\\'s really quiet. All of a sudden he just screams \"YOU POSTED MY DICK ON SNAPCHAT\". I just giggle and say \"haha real funny\". Then I thought about it for a second and realized what happened. I started laughing so hard I was crying and I couldn\\'t breathe. \\n\\nI open my phone to look and sure enough in the corner of the video you can see my husband\\'s meat thermometer just hanging out in the corner, glitter filter and all. This brought on another bout of crying laughter and he decided to take my phone away. \\n\\nWe deleted the video, then he records himself explaining what happened and that he hopes everyone that viewed my story enjoyed the show. He then shames me and points the camera to me and I\\'m hiding my face and still laughing. \\n\\nI feel like I should mention that we both found this hilarious and no one is angry. It\\'s definitely an interesting story to tell everyone who missed out. \\n\\nTL;DR: Posted a video to my Snapchat story of my dog being a goof while my husband laid in bed naked and got his womb broom on camera.\\n\\nEdited to add dog tax\\n\\n\\n[Dog Tax](https://imgur.com/a/zHzpfCs) Throwaway because there\\'s just no way I\\'m immortalizing this shit on my actual Reddit account. \\n\\nThis morning my mom messaged me to ask if I could come over and update the antivirus software on her PC. I agreed to drop in when I\\'m done working.\\n\\nFast forward to me appearing in front of my mom\\'s computer, initiating the update process, and proceeding to do nothing but stare at the progress bar. While I was doing that, my mom proceeded to prepare dinner. \\n\\nThe update was taking forever so I decided to kill time by bringing necessary order to my mom\\'s desktop. It was a mess. Dozens of random folders scattered across the screen in no particular order whatsoever. I couldn\\'t even see the fucking wallpaper. It was enough to summon the OCDemon buried inside of me and clean up the clutter. \\n\\nSo, as I was organizing my mom\\'s shit, I noticed a folder called \"Mom\\'s Recipes\". Now, as a guy who\\'s dating a girl who loves a man who can cook, this folder peaked my interest. I figured it wouldn\\'t hurt skimming over some of my mom\\'s recipes and perhaps surprising the girlfriend with an unexpected home cooked meal.\\n\\nI opened the recipe folder and clicked on the word document inside. Now, I\\'ll be honest, I\\'m not the world\\'s most intelligent person, but when I see the words \"mom\" and \"recipes\", I imagine wholesome family dinners and shit. NOT...\\n\\n\"I\\'m a woman, I\\'m a widow, I\\'m a mother, I\\'m over 50, and I\\'m still the whore next door\"\\n\\nThis was the fucking opening line to my mom\\'s so called \"recipes\". It was an ominous sign that I should not read any fucking further. I read further. It became clear to me my mom\\'s recipes had nothing to do with how to cook, but rather how to fuck. I made it through the first two pages before the \"recipe book\" went into graphic detail about what my mom\\'s preferences were when it comes to size of the dick going into her mouth and vagina versus the size of the dick going into her ass. \\n\\nI closed the document, finished the update, and got the fuck away from that computer. My mom invited me stay for dinner but I declined. All I could see was different sized dicks entering my mother everywhere. I think I need to end our relationship now. \\n\\nTL;DR Read my mom\\'s recipes and realized her favorite ingredient is cock. This actually happened today.\\n\\nSo my gf and her mother haven\\'t spoken much in the last few years. She lives up in Ohio and we reside in Florida. Well this past year, they have made a meaningful effort to reconnect and be closer.\\n\\nThe last time she visited, she saw an old Wii remote lying around and expressed how much she loved the Wii Tennis game. I always enjoyed the bowling game myself.\\n\\nNow to the fuck up.\\n\\nI thought it would be a nice gesture to get a working Wii and Wii sports game for the next time she visits.\\n\\nSo I text her: \\n\\nMe: Hey, guess what you can do next time you visit?\\n\\nHer: What\\'s that?\\n\\nMe: Bowl me! If you think you stand a chance. >:)\\n\\nHer: Excuse me?\\n\\nMe: You heard me, lol.\\n\\nSo 20 minutes or so go by, and my gf calls me, laughing hysterically.\\n\\nI never said \"Bowl me\" oh no dear Reddit, I wrote \"Blow me\"\\n\\nLuckily, her mom is pretty down to earth, and laughed it off, but neither are gonna let me live it down anytime soon.\\n\\nTL;DR: Got Wii sports for gf\\'s mom visits, told her she could blow me instead of Bowl me. So we had just finished having a wholesome breakfast of eggs, potatoes and cinnabread my wife made and I hopped into the shower. When I shower I listen to a bluetooth speaker, mostly youtube. Midway through my shower my wife unlocked the door and busted in claiming she had to pee. I\\'m a private person and always shower with the door locked, but obviously she isn\\'t. After she finished she asked to come into the shower, but I was in the midst of shaving my legs (yes I\\'m a guy, I just don\\'t like body hair) and told her no because I had a razor in my hand and our shower is a tiny two shoulder\\'s width stall. She said fine and walked away. Shortly after her departure my audio goes out, and I hear the sound of a cat meowing angirly into a microphone blare out of my speaker. This is followed by a series of animal noises and a slew of additional videos including such gems as \"Top 3 Minecraft songs\" and \"3 hours of farting.\" Sure enough, she\\'d stolen my phone. I got out of the shower when she started blasting victory royal fanfare and when she saw me she started dabbing furiously and ran away. This behavior continued for at least ten more minutes before I was finally able to get my phone back.\\n\\nEDIT: First time using reddit, color me impressed. I did not expect this to get nearly the attention that it did and thanks very much to the lovely people who gave me the silvers and the gold! This is not an isolated incident, if my wife finds that I\\'ve left my phone unattended while she suspects my headphones are in she will steal it and my music will be instantly cut off and replaced. Her go-to video is \\'3 Hours of Farting\\' and her stated goal is to one day have me make it through the entire video in this manner. I am extremely aware that she is an absolute gem of a woman and I\\'m very grateful to have her in my life, thanks to those of you who\\'ve pointed that out. For those of you \\nasking, shower sex was not an option. Our shower is smaller than the tiny shower stalls you\\'d find in the changing rooms at your local beach. We\\'ve done shower sex before, it\\'s a miserable experience, shampoo bottles falling all over your ankles, would choose a bed every time.\\n\\nTL;DR, I married a middle schooler in a 23 year old woman\\'s body and got dabbed on. \\n\\nNot a fuck up that just happened, but one that I just realized happened. \\n\\nThis Christmas season, and like the last few, I did almost at all of my shopping via Amazon. For friends and family that live far away I had their gifts shipped right to their house.\\n\\nAfter spending more that I should this holiday season I haven\\'t felt the need to buy anything until last week. I remembered I had a $50 Amazon gift card, and decided to get myself more boxer briefs and black long sleeve undershirts. I ended up with around $70 (Puma performance boxer briefs are super comfy) in my cart. A few quick clicks and one confirmation email let me know my order went through. \\n\\nLike I said that was last week. But as of today the package still hadn\\'t gotten here. So I checked my order and it says that it arrived. I was pissed. I had issues with delivery in the past. But I live in a small apartment building and I didn\\'t think anyone would take my boxes. \\n\\nAnd then I noticed the address it shipped to. Apparently Amazon auto filled in the last address I used:\\n\\n my Reddit Secret Santa. \\n\\nSo one of you guys out there got a random shipment of underwear. If you could return them  PM me. I\\'d appreciate it. Otherwise enjoy some comfy boxer briefs.\\n\\nTL;DR my secret santa got a surprise gift. Naturally, this TIFU didn’t actually happen today. \\n\\nThis happened about two weeks ago. Honestly, the moment it happened I considered writing this post, but felt that in light of making the mistake of sending my johnson out, I might give myself some time to make sure I want this to live online forever.\\n\\nMy family has already told just about everyone they know the story, so I figured I\\'d bring all of you into the fold.\\n\\nSo, here we go.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I have been together for about 3 years, and I\\'m deeply in love with this girl. She is decent beyond words, fun, funny and frankly I couldn\\'t imagine a better relationship.\\n\\nHer mother had offered me her grandmother\\'s ring for our engagement, which I considered a tremendous honour. After dealing with the anxiety of toting around a family heirloom for 2 weeks and leaving it in the possession of a jeweller for cleaning and resizing, I just wanted to get the engagement over with.\\n\\nI know that might not sound like the most romantic way of describing my engagement, but I was nervous.\\n\\nI get home, get down on one knee, and she says yes.\\n\\nIt was a moment I won\\'t soon forget...then...then I got creative on really burning it into my memory.\\n\\nNow, in my opinion, everyone more or less does their engagement announcements the same way. Holding hands close up with a ring on, or the couples pic with the open hand across the dudes chest with the ring visible, \"it\\'s been done to death\" I thought.\\n\\nI proposed to my now fiancée that we do something funny and different, and she agrees.\\n\\nWe settle on taking a picture of me completely naked, laying in bed, with her hand in the foreground covering my crotch with the ring on. The picture is hilarious, and we send it to my family group chat.\\n\\nI mean, this is my naked body afterall. Clearly, for my families eyes only.\\n\\nAs it turns out, the picture was taken on \\'live mode\\'. When you held it down, my girlfriends hand would move out of the way, leaving a perfect shot of me, as naked as the day I was born, grinning from ear to ear, doing finger guns.\\n\\nI received a message from my brother-in-law informing us that the picture is live, that my sister was the one to discover it, and he follows it up with a picture of her in a shocked state of bewilderment.\\n\\nMy mother got it too, same mistake.\\n\\nHer first, unsolicited dick pic, at the age of 61...from her son, no less.\\n\\nNeedless to say, it\\'s a story that will be told despite my protests for the remainder of my days.\\n\\nTL;DR my fianée and I took a perfectly positioned photo of her engagement ring covering my package, only to have \\'live mode\\' ruin it all. This actually happened about an hour ago. I\\'m just now starting to come out of my humiliating shock.\\n\\nSo...I\\'m sitting at mass listening to the reading when I feel a slight grumble in my stomach,\\n\\n\"uh oh...gas.\"\\n\\nNo biggie, this has happened before, I\\'ll either wait for a song and let it go or wait for the homily (sermon for you protestants) and sneak over into the bathroom and take care of business. But alas, my body had other plans.\\n\\nWe stood to chant the psalm, the pressure is building, I\\'m starting to panic, not sure if I can hold it. We finish the psalm and the church goes to sit and just as I land on the pew...\\n\\nIT HAPPENED!\\n\\nNow this wasn\\'t a quick fart, it was one of those that lasted a few seconds, a cheek rumbler, and the sound was amplified by the solid oak pew. It created a lovely vibrato that echoed off the walls and filled the church with what could best be described as Gabriel\\'s trumpet.\\n\\nThe church was quiet for a few seconds then the giggling started, I looked up to the altar and the priest was physically trying not to laugh, the second reader ascended the altar. At this point, there is muffled laughter all around...then...it happens...\\n\\nThe priest stands up at his chair, says \"I\\'m sorry...I\\'m sorry...I can\\'t...\" and he runs off to the side entrance to the sacristy, I can hear him laughing.\\n\\nAt this point I decide it\\'s a total loss, I shame facedly duck out of the back of the church, run to my car and have been hiding in my house ever since.\\n\\nTL;DR  Farted during mass, made the priest laugh and now I gotta find another church.  I have a weird habit of naming things. I\\'ve named my houseplants and the most used things in my house. My best friend finds the\\xa0habit\\xa0funny and has started doing it herself to some extent.\\n\\nWell a few weeks ago I was looking for a new\\xa0vibrator\\xa0and found one I liked and ordered it. I have a close relationship with my best friend\\xa0and\\xa0we talk about everything together so I also told her about this new\\xa0purchase. I\\xa0of course\\xa0gave the vibrator a name, Billy.\\n\\nWell Billy finally arrived in the mail a few days ago and I gave it test run. Billy was great, nothing to complain about. Later I was texting my friend and she asked me about my vibrator and if it was any good since she was contemplating\\xa0whether\\xa0to get one herself. She texted me with \"Did you try Billy already, was he worth it?\" To which I replayed: \"Yeah Billy was great, a bit\\xa0expensive\\xa0but I\\'d say he was\\xa0definitely\\xa0worth it. Good when \"my boyfriends name\" is not around haha\"\\n\\nNow that doesn\\'t sound too weird if you know that Billy is a vibrator. My boyfriend of two months unfortunately didn\\'t know that.\\xa0\\n\\nMy boyfriend saw the texts without me knowing and confronted me a few days later. He was angry asking me how I could cheat on him and basically broke up with me while I was standing there like an idiot trying to figure out what was going on. I asked him\\xa0what the hell\\xa0he was talking about and he started shouting at me about me fucking some prostitute called Billy.\\n\\nThat was when I realized what had happened and all I could do was laugh. I explained to him through my laughter that Billy was my vibrator I had named, not another man I was sleeping with. After\\xa0a lot\\xa0of explaining he finally understood the situation and calmed down. He now knows about my weird habit of naming things.\\n\\nTldr; I named my new vibrator Billy and texted my friend about it. My\\xa0boyfriend\\xa0saw the texts and thought I was cheating on him with a male prostitute.\\n\\nEdit: I appreciate your concerns about my relationship. It\\'s always nice to see that people care. But like I have said in the comments, we both have each others permission to use each others phones to a certain extent. He saw the texts by accident and I trust him since he hasn\\'t given me any reasons not to. This issue has been talked about between the two of us and that\\'s all I\\'m going to say about it. Throwaway obviously. This is a few months old but I feel like I have to get it out of my head.\\n\\nSo I know most people masturbate in the shower or in the toilet but I\\'ve always done it in bed. I am living with my parents so I guess I just like the privacy of my room. Then - and this is what I now realize is me being a fucking weirdo - when it was time I would just pull up the blanket, roll over to the side a bit and cum onto the wall/below the bed. I never really thought much of it and it never smelled bad so I just kept doing it because it was easy... Nobody noticed and people seldom visited my room anyway.\\n\\nAfter some years of doing this I recently reached a few difficult points in my life and this exacerbated my masturbation habits. I used to only masturbate like once a week or so (maybe that\\'s why it didn\\'t smell?) but for a couple of weeks I started doing it every day, sometimes a few times a day. This usually wouldn\\'t be anything out of the ordinary for a teenager but since I was always ejaculating on my wall/bed I began to get a bad cockroach infestation there. \\n\\nI didn\\'t notice at first and since I\\'ve never had cockroaches before I didn\\'t really know what they were but eventually I read up on the internet that cockroaches like to live in dark, moist places in the house and that made sense... At first I felt really disgusted. I wanted to exterminate them but I definitely didn\\'t want my parents to find out what happened, so I tried to kill them by flicking them into a bowl of water and watching them drown. But then I felt really bad.\\n\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t know why but it felt like murder. I didn\\'t really dislike the cockroaches. I had never even seen cockroaches before and they were kind of interesting. So I decided to stop killing them and kind of just let them be for like a week (at this point I finally began masturbating in the shower). I know this sounds really weird but I kind of began thinking of them as my children. It started out as a joke-thought but then it got more serious. Like, they were literally borne out of my sperm... so in my mind it made sense that they were my offspring in a way. I actually want kids when I grow up. And this was kind of like that - I used to bring them food and stuff from the kitchen and play with them by moving them around the room or letting them crawl on me and I just got really emotionally attached to them for a while even though they were obviously just insects.\\n\\n\\n\\nThen my parents found out. I think my dad saw one in the kitchen and immediately freaked out and called the exterminator the same day while I was at school. \\n\\n\\n\\nSo we had to move out for about a week to an Airbnb and I was really depressed the entire time but I couldn\\'t tell them why. They thought I just didn\\'t like the Airbnb.\\n\\nTL;DR I jerked off onto the wall and got a cockroach infestation I was making myself a stir fry today and accidentally poured way too much vegetable oil into the pan. I hadn\\'t put anything else in, so I poured most of it out into a bowl. I left it on the counter and began making my food. \\n\\nA couple minutes later, I heard gagging noises coming from the counter next to me. I looked over to see one of the little gremlins *drinking* the vegetable oil. He was lapping it up and gagging as he drank. As I watched in horror, he hopped down from the counter, spilling the oil all over his buddy. \\n\\nAnd of course, since they\\'re tiny monsters, they decided it was the perfect time to cuddle and groom one another. Gremlin 1 licked his fur buddy all over, making sure as much surface area as possible was covered, while Gremlin 2 purred and rubbed up against Gremlin 1, coating both from head to toe. \\n\\nNow they\\'re dashing around the house. They\\'re impossible to catch. The monsters are coated all over with oil. They\\'re shiny and slippery and hyperactive. I\\'m trying to chase them down and wiping up their tiny oily paw prints as I type this. If I can herd them into the bathroom, I might stand a chance. Every surface in the house is covered in oil. \\n\\nTl;dr: My gremlins are covered in oil. I\\'m chasing them. They\\'re like snakes.\\n\\nEdit: The slippery kittens are locked in the bathroom with water and litter boxes now. I\\'ve wiped them off a bit (using dawn dish soap, thx everyone!) and I\\'m going to give them a proper bath later today. I\\'m waiting a bit on the bath so I can get some help (probably not a good idea to bathe kittens without backup). Fortunately neither has experienced any digestive issues yet, hoping it stays that way!\\n\\nEdit 2: The gremlins are washed now. They were surprisingly sweet about it. They complained a bit, but mostly stayed in place as we washed them. We had a little incident with Gremlin 2 trying to climb the shower curtain when we first put him in, but he calmed down quickly. It was hot today, so they\\'ll dry off quickly! So, I have a parrot and online classes. We are not required to have video in the online class, so we just connect our microphones. Today, my bed, was extremely comfortable. As I got up at 10 am to join the online meeting in Zoom, my bed started calling me. I fucking felt it. I joined, and didn\\'t mute myself. Normally I\\'d mute myself because I have a parrot. My parrot is an Indian Ringneck, and those bastards are loud as fuck. I decided to fall asleep through the whole class as my bed felt so good.  Only after I woke up an hour after the class I realised I was still in the meeting with an unmuted microphone. I texted one of my classmates and they told me they couldn\\'t have a normal class, and the teacher didn\\'t know how to kick me out. They also said they tried talking with the parrot, they told me he said \"Hello\" and \"What you doing\" and then proceeded to repeat \"ok\" for the duration of the class. \\n\\nTLDR: I joined my online class, forgot to mute myself, slept, and my parrot was screaming all throughout it.\\n\\nEDIT: Talked with my teacher to explain her what the hell was going on and she told me she hadn\\'t muted me because she wanted to have fun with the parrot. I guess teachers can get lonely in such depressing times.\\n\\nEDIT 2: Since you all have been asking me for pictures, here you go.\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/parrots/comments/fr50y2/my_wet_chicken_salutes_you/\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/parrots/comments/foqa65/my_parrot_has_made_a_new_friend_during_this/\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/parrots/comments/fn2b3u/oh_youre_home_now/\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/parrots/comments/e201s1/hello_first_time_poster_on_this_sub_i_just_got/ >TL;Dr: My Fiancé bought 60mg peach rings, I woke up at around midnight with a sweet tooth, and ate two of them in a disoriented sleepy state. I had not ever done marijuana until that point, and I got very, very high.\\n\\nSo, My fiancé of two years is a marijuana consumer, she enjoys a good buzz after work, and I enjoy a glass of whiskey and a cigar once a month, that’s just the way we are, she’s happy, I’m happy.\\n\\nShe had always wanted to get me stoned since our first date, since I had never tried marijuana, and I had always promised that our wedding night would be our first time getting high together.\\n\\nI include this information, because I feel I need to emphasize how unprepared my body was for what happened to me.\\n\\nYesterday, I got out of the hospital due to COVID complications, I am feeling about 80% normal I’d say, congested, but normal, and I felt extremely exhausted, so I went to our bedroom and crashed out. \\n\\nWhen I awoke, the thirst in my mouth was sandy, and the heat from my body seemed almost leeched entirely into the bed. So I got up, and looked at my phone, as you do, and I see that it’s around 11:30 pm. I walk into my kitchen, and I get myself a giant glass of cold water. My fiancé is on video calls with her friends in the living room, foggy smoke fills the air. \\n\\nShe has Oreos by her, but I am balls out naked, and if I were to go, her webcam would surely capture the shmeat and broadcast it to four women and a flamboyantly gay man enjoying their night. \\n\\nBut I’m sleepy and I want sweets\\n\\nSo in my stupor, I open the snack cupboard, and grab... peach rings, that’s all the bag says on the top, (brand)Peach Rings. \\n\\nI popped one in my mouth, and grabbed two more, and put the baggy back in the cabinet, and scuttled off, but after the second peach ring, the aftertaste was bitter, I figured they were just sugar free, but because I have a mild allergic reaction to some sweeteners, I decided to go back to read the ingredients on the back of the package:\\n\\nOn the FRONT OF THE BAG it actually says (brand) THC INFUSED peach rings, 60 mg... my initial thoughts weren’t so abnormal, 60 mg sounds like nothing, like if I took a 60 mg ibuprofen that would barely be any ibuprofen, right? So my logic was that it would be like taking almost nothing\\n\\nSo I called my fiancé into the room with me, and I told her what happened, she told me to eat something right away, she ended up warming me up some Chef Boyardee Ravioli, and sat me down at our dining table, and I pulled out my phone to watch something. \\n\\nBetween bites of nuclear tomato sauce and super-processed meat filled pasta, I picked up my phone and went to type “king of the hill” on Hulu. \\n\\nI got three letters in and suddenly it felt like I had just had my hand in the snow, you know that numb sensation that makes you feel like your hand is a lot fatter or wider than it is? I couldn’t muster the dexterity to type anymore\\n\\nThen I looked over to my fiancé, and it was like a laggy video game, I moved, but my vision didn’t keep up with my movement, like 30 seconds later I was mentally where my body was. \\n\\nI could only say what I felt in that moment, a long and whispery “Noooooooooooo~”\\n\\nThat got the attention of my lover, who looked at me and said “how does your nose feel”, which cued me to touch my nose, it felt like it was feet away from my eyes. \\n\\n>From here, my memory gets spotty, but here’s how I remember the rest of the night: \\n\\nThe time on my phone was now 12:45 am\\n\\nmy fiancé tells me to finish my food, and I did, but every bite felt it was minutes long\\n\\nWhen I ate all of my ravioli, I said I wanted to go to bed\\n\\nSuddenly- I am in bed and I look at my phone, it’s 12:50, this upset me, I remember trying to reason with my feelings, because I felt like it should have been much later\\n\\nMy fiancé comes into the bedroom, I ask her how I got there\\n\\nShe laughs\\n\\nI blink\\n\\nShe’s gone\\n\\nI call for her\\n\\nShe’s next to the bed now, and I get an overwhelming sense of dread in my gut and chest, everything is spinning \\n\\nShe tells me I’ll be okay, and touches my head\\n\\nIn close my eyes for what feels like a long while, I open them, \\n\\nShe’s still in the same position, over me, playing with my hair.\\n\\nIt’s 1:15 am, and I am relatively lucid, and paranoia is just barely getting his Dick lubed up for me \\n\\nAt some point I wanted to cuddle with my woman, because I felt like I was somewhat safe when we were closely embraced.\\n\\n>from this point forward this is what she says happened \\n\\n“You wanted me to cuddle but your fever was so hot I couldn’t just spoon you in good conscience, but you tucked your face into my neck and the rest of your body was diagonal across the bed”\\n\\n“You asked how long the feeling would last, I told you that you weren’t even at your peak yet, and you cried, which is so not you, you don’t cry, which got me panicked” \\n\\n“You asked me to read the back of the package to you, and when I got up to go get it, you stopped me and asked me where I was going, when I told you, you said okay, then when I got back, you asked me where I went”\\n\\n“You said thank you for the macaroni about 10 times, and I said you’re welcome, but then I asked /what macaroni/ your final time, which made you talk about how they don’t eat meat sauce on their spaghetti in Italy” \\n\\n“You told me that if you died of Rona, that you didn’t want me to tell your mom and dad you did weed” \\n\\n“You asked me to read a Wikipedia article about how to stop a weed overdose, which I couldn’t find because it doesn’t exist”\\n\\n“I made you chew on black peppercorns, because it makes some people sober up, but you just kept saying you couldn’t taste it”\\n\\n“At about 2-2:30 am, you just kept asking me how long it had been every 2-5 minutes, then you fell asleep, and you’d wake up and then wake me up periodically to tell me you think it’s going away”\\n\\nAnd that’s how it went for an few hours\\n\\n>things I apparently hallucinated while awake and did not dream like I thought I did\\n\\nThe bed filling with water like a waterbed\\n\\nMy sisters coming over but hiding from me\\n\\nMy phone ringing\\n\\nThe window (second story) being tapped on \\n\\nMy dad coming in the room and saying things to me like “I’m disappointed in you”\\n\\nThe room moving in twisty ways, or like I was floating on a boat\\n\\n>in conclusion \\n\\nIt’s now been 16 hours and I still feel a little off\\n\\nMy fiancé says there are things she won’t tell me about my time on my trip, things she wants to keep to herself, she says they aren’t about her or me, but she thinks that they are a big part of who I am, and that she loves me even more because, she says she has seen my realest self\\n\\nAlso, I was in hysterics at a few points in the night, and she doesn’t want me to feel too embarrassed\\n\\nThanks for reading.\\n\\nEdit: This will be my only edit,  firstly, thank you for everyone that gave an award, the most I’ve ever gotten in my life. \\n\\nSecondly, \\n\\nI cannot express my love for every comment that I have received, and will receive. I am still coming down off of the edibles and this thread has taken me on a completely different trip of its own. A lot of you have stories, a lot of you have said some really encouraging things, some of you have skeptical takes, and all of these things are welcome, to discuss this moment of my life has been extremely rewarding. Thirteen or so years ago I worked as a paralegal having done a law degree at the age of 40. The firm of solicitors I worked at were part of a big chain who produced free wills via workplace offers and trade union deals. People would fill out a form, send it in and we would construct their will based on the preferences on the form.\\n\\nI was sharing an office with an attractive, funny and smart young woman (23) who gave me the appropriate training to complete these wills. At the time i was 46. \\n\\nShe had dumped her boyfriend of several years because she found out he had been sleeping with someone else while she was at university. Their home town was several hundred miles away.  During her brief period of being single she asked me what sort of age gap between people was acceptable. We had long conversations about it. I told her i knew of couples who were 5, 10, 12, 15 and 17 years older/younger than their wife/husband/partner.\\n\\nShe then mentioned that she had heard that centuries ago older men often married.much younger women as they were more able to take care of said younger woman who was more likely to survive childbirth and go on to be a good mother while the more mature husband\\'s income kept them comfortable. \\n\\nShe kept asking my opinion and asked if I would ever consider seeing a younger/older woman than me. Not thinking it very likely I just shrugged and avoided the question.\\n\\nThroughout the months we worked together we often went out after work and at the weekends in a group. She would dress very provocatively and on the occasions she wore stockings she would let me know she was (I\\'d previously confessed to having a particular weakness/fondness for them). After several months she got onto a Solicitors training programme and left. We kept in touch and met on occasions for food, coffee or drinks. \\n\\nAfter a couple of years she met someone at her new firm and we stopped meeting. They got married and had a baby.\\n\\nI bumped into her about an hour ago in court. I was delivering some papers and she was there representing a client. She was all over me and insisted we had coffee and a chat. It was then that she told me that the reason for asking about big age gap relationships was that she had a massive crush on me but was too scared of damaging our friendship by doing anything about it but hoped that I would. When she finally decided it wasnt going to happen she left.\\n\\nOf course I had absolutely no idea this was going on and that this gorgeous young woman had any interest in me beyond friendship. Honestly, I could cry.\\n\\nTL:DR Made friends with hot girl in the office, didn\\'t notice she had a crush on me. (just happened) Ok, so I\\'m a kinky guy, and I\\'m into kinky things. So I\\'ve been being submissive to my wife for a couple weeks. I\\'m into lots of odd things, including forced intoxication. So I\\'ve been drinking whenever she tells me to all night, so I\\'m drunk as shit. She tells me to find some zipties, some lube, and the strapon. \"Yes!\" I think, as I assemble everything and lay in bed. \\nShe comes in, and we start fondling each other, and everything is amazing. I get on all fours on the bed as she secures a rather large purple strapon around her waist. She spreads my ass and \"BLLAARTVJGKOOJ\" a giant fart that I had no control over pushes it\\'s way out of my ass, directly into her face.\\nMy partner of 8 years promptly exits the room and vomits into the toilet and says \"I\\'m so sorry... I just can\\'t. I can\\'t do anything\". I asked her to turn off the lights and leave, and here I am, naked on the bed, legs spread, confiding in the internet. FML. \\n\\nTL;DR: I farted in my wife\\'s face as she was about to peg me for the first time, she vomited, I want to die.\\n\\n\\nEdit: Holy crap everyone, thanks for all the awards! I just woke up and am very hungover. I feel obliged to say that drinking too much can be dangerous, know your limits!\\n\\nEdit#2: We didn\\'t end up using the zipties, and you should listen to all the good Redditors below telling you not to. TIFU by sending a mortifying text to me dad\\n\\nTo preface, this happened yesterday and I’m still processing and trying to come to terms with the fact that this is what I have to live with moving forward with my life. \\n\\nI had a stressful week with school, work, running errands, arranging pet sitting while I’ll be gone, numerous other unnecessary stressors, change of plans, and packing for my week long trip to VA. Yesterday in particular was super stressful, I came home from an overnight stay at a new sexual partner’s place, Nick. I was texting Nick, my best friend, my sister in law, my step mom, and my dad all at the same time. \\n\\nYou can probably already guess what happened...\\n\\nI was texting Nick, we were reflecting on the night before and my dad suddenly texted wishing my sister and I a safe trip and all that good stuff. I finished my text to Nick and was replying to my best friend who I had already been texting prior to my dad. While I was texting my best friend, I received a question mark reaction (iPhone) text from my dad, which left me confused for a split second because I haven’t responded to him yet. Low and behold, of course I sent the inappropriate text to me dad instead of to Nick!!!!!!!\\n\\nFML!!!!!! I am mortified to say the least! My soul left my body. I screamed my lungs out for the next 10 minutes, trying to decide if this is the sign to jump off the bridge. \\n\\n\\nSorry dad, you don’t deserve more gray hairs. \\n\\n [Screenshots of the text](https://imgur.com/gallery/XVHO9O2)\\n\\nYou’re welcome to cringe with me and laugh at me.\\n\\nTL;DR sent my dad an inappropriate text that was supposed to be for my partner.\\n\\nUPDATE. This blew up way more than expected. I hope you all had a great laugh at my mega cringe moment. \\nYes, I’m OK. \\nThank you to all that reached out and were concerned for my safety. I will get tested as soon as I get back home from my trip and yes I will end the relationship. This just happened today.\\n\\nI was on a zoom call with my class this morning. Now, I haven\\'t been up this early in a while so I was really groggy. I put my camera off and muted myself because I really just wasn\\'t arsed to put up with it. Then it happened.\\n\\nI felt a gurgling in my stomach. Realised what needed to happen. I gotta break the wind.\\n\\n I had a plan: mute myself, release the toxic gas and unmute myself as if nothing happened.\\n\\nI clicked the mute button, let it rip and unmuted myself again as if nothing happened. There was an eerie silence in the zoom call, then some people started giggling. I knew something was wrong, then I realised my issue and where I fucked up.\\n\\nI was already on mute from when I joined the call. When I muted AGAIN, I had actually unmuted myself. I was so tired I just didn\\'t think about it.\\n\\nEveryone heard me free the beast. Everyone. It was like I had done it in an actual class. I was mortified and immediately left and haven\\'t joined back. I\\'m expecting an email from my teacher on the issue, but I\\'m not sure he really wants to. I\\'ll update if he does.\\n\\nEveryone watched me, out of the blue, unmute myself, cut the cheese and then mute myself again. This is the worst thing to happen to me throughout lockdown.\\n\\nTl;Dr : I was tired and needed to fart in a zoom call. I unmuted myself(thinking I had muted myself) and farted in front of my whole class. Not a massive fuck up but a fuck up nonetheless.\\n\\nI am a camp counsellor for a local youth camp, and we are running online activities with the kids who just started their school holidays (whatever that means with covid-19 restrictions). For our age group (grade 7, so 12/13) we were running a \"pub quiz\" run by a PowerPoint presentation with the questions and answers .\\n\\nI was in charge of making the PowerPoint and I was using the “insert image from online” option, which limits my options but I didn’t feel like having a bunch of random images on my hard drive. One of the questions in the “Disney” category was about Disney princesses. I used [this](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8206/8230704981_1b02ab35fc_z.jpg) image and didn’t notice anything wrong. I was using split-screen, one screen for the PowerPoint and the other for the questions so the image was small to me.  The first time I saw this picture in full size was during the activity with the children. I had a mild panic attack and I very quickly “accidentally” skipped to the answer. Afterwards I showed the other counsellors and we had a laugh about it.\\n\\nTL;DR I accidentally showed a bunch of 7th grade children Disney princesses wearing sheer dresses with their nipples clearly visible while running a session for a youth camp\\n\\np.s not sure if NSFW but better safe than sorry This happened 2 weeks ago and I’ve only just stopped cringing entirely when I think about it.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I were visiting his (quite conservative) parents house for the weekend. I took a shower, and I remember feeling really smug because I remembered to bring all of my cleansing stuff with me, including my new cleansing brush. For anyone that doesn’t know what it is, it’s literally a small handheld electronic contraption with a brush at the end of it, and does a better job of cleansing your face and leaving your skin smooth af than if you just used a flannel. \\n\\nAfter using it, I wrapped myself in a towel and was sorting out my shower bag when I had the amazing idea of detaching the brush from my cleanser, and leaving both parts on the windowsill to dry. It’s important to note that I had the contraption body facing away, towards the window, so you could only really see the handle and then the back of the ‘head’ of it.\\n\\nAnyway, everything’s fine for a couple of hours - boyfriend and I are sitting in his bedroom when his dad knocks on the door, gives me a really shifty look and then asks for “a word” with my boyfriend. We both looked at each other weirded out, but my boyfriend obliged and went outside to the hallway.\\n\\nAfter a few moments he comes back in a bit red in the face, sits down on the bed and says “why did you leave a sex toy in the bathroom?”  Obviously I was perplexed, saying I REALLY had no idea what he was talking about. He was embarrassed rather than accusatory, and explained his dad had briefly described it as “pink with a big bulb” and then it hit me.\\n\\nI too, went bright red and laughed rather uncomfortably as I explained what it was. Unfortunately, I didn’t realise his dad was lingering outside the door still. \\n\\n“You don’t have to lie BloatedRabbit, it’s ok but just next time don’t leave it around for everyone to see.”\\n\\n“I swear on my life it’s a face cleanser!” I said, rushing up and retrieving it with the brush attachment. I handed it over and he looked really sheepish and apologised, and we both had a bit of an awkward laugh about it. My boyfriend then decides to take the jokes up a notch and say how stupid his dad is, and how he’s a dirty old man for thinking like that. His dad got a bit defensive, and his response still makes me want to crawl into a hole and die when I think about it.\\n\\n“Well I’m sorry, but it looks just like one of your mother’s toys!” \\n\\n\\nI’m not religious at all, but when I say I wanted God to beam me up there and then... I’m not kidding. I felt like jumping out the window. The whole energy of the room shifted. His dad made a hasty retreat as my boyfriend stood there gobsmacked, and we didn’t dare leave the bedroom again for the next couple of hours.\\n\\nWorst part was we had a family dinner that night, and his mum asked me about the facial cleanser and where to buy one. My boyfriend and his dad put their forks down at the same time. Talk about awkward.\\n\\nTL;DR I left my facial cleansing brush on the windowsill of my boyfriend’s conservative parents bathroom. His dad found it, thought it was a sex toy, and when boyfriend took the piss he accidentally revealed it looked like one of my boyfriend’s mum’s toys. Not today, but Black Mirror subpost about season 3 being the best was trending yestersay, and I just remembered my fuck up. \\n\\nSaid episode was \"Shut up and Dance\", where the young protagonist was forced to rob a bank, fight other people, etc. Because an unknown person hacked into his computer and threatened to reveal his dark secrets if not complied. \\n\\nNow, I don\\'t understand how, but for some reason, the audio description was turned on when the episode began. So the narrator describes the characters\\' actions inbetween dialogues like, \"Sister comes up and touches his hands\" and whatnot. \\n\\nHad it been any other shows or movies, my wife and I definitely would had caught this mistake instantly. But of course, the Black Mirror always fucks with our minds, so we just went with it and hypothesized what the voice could be, and what the episode was trying to tell us. \\n\\nI think we came up with some absurd ideas like episode is about how we don\\'t really have free will, only chosen ones can hear this voice, the narrating voice is the hacker, etc. We were basically focused only on the voice in the sky the entire episode. \\n\\nWell, the end was near, and came the twist. Normally, we would have gasped at the revelation (more surprising because there were subtle hints throughout), but not this time. We were like yeah, yeah, that\\'s cool, so what was the voice? And to our complete and utter shock, the episode was over without any explaination about the voice.\\n\\nWe were quite dumbfounded at this point, because as complex as Black Mirror episodes go, we could at least understand the basic message it was trying to tell us, but this time we couldn\\'t grasp anything. After some thinking and talking, we cut our losses and just moved on to the next episode where we soon found we are too dumb for this show.  \\n\\nTl;dr turned on audio description, thought it was part of the show and got really confused.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit: mostly lurker, I don\\'t know if there are any etiquettes I have to follow through, I will upvote everyone\\'s comments for now.\\n\\nFor those who says it\\'s not TIFU, I guess it\\'s mundane, that\\'s true. Since some folks are okay with the change of intensity? Of fuck up, and so are mods,  I am at peace with it. This happened a couple days ago, and all I wish was I done it sooner.\\n\\nThe story starts at my parents wedding. Cracking night etc, but the following morning I comfort my sister crying. She ends up telling me my Aunt\\'s BF slept with our god-sister at the wedding night. \\nMy immediate response is, well gotta tell her, it\\'s what I\\'d want if it was me. \\nI go talk about it with my parents who know, and dad says it\\'s not his business (he\\'s a very \"too himself\" type of guy, don\\'t want to get involved) but I plead with my mother saying it\\'s her sister, it should come from her. She tells me not to and if I do \"I\\'ll disown you and never talk to you in my life.\". \\n\\nWe then found out she was pregnant with his kid, another nail in telling her coffin.\\nSo I keep my mouth shut.\\nThis is my first fuck up, as I myself am very unconcerned about what others think, as long as I believe truly, I\\'m doing the right thing.\\n\\nI vent about it to my SO and explain what my mum said etc, she understand but still think I should find a way to tell my aunt without it being pinned on me.\\nI thought about it to many a night.\\n\\nCutting to the chase, 7-8 months go by and still no one has said a thing, He(cheat) prances around like he owns the place, and My god-sister believes she\\'s got away with it.\\nWe had a small family BBQ to celebrate birthdays, (well within the social distancing rules in the UK)\\nAll going fine until I overhear Cheat saying something on the phone, \"Yeah I\\'ll see you later, stop calling me until I call you\" on phone with GS.\\nSomething in me snapped and I asked if my aunt wanted to go shop with me.\\nAs we are walking she could tell something was wrong. She kept pressing me to say, I told her it would ruin her life.. so I did, I told her, knowing how she would react, knowing it\\'ll be me to get the blame for any fallout and me taking the brunt of hatred from everyone. But I did, and do believe it was the right thing to do.\\n\\nAnd the fallout was crazy, she confronted him, he came at me, throwing me against a car, smashing a vase on my leg(3stitches(first time ever)) threatening my family, my mum not talking to me, just, hell let loose..fear of what my aunt would do if left alone.\\n\\nAs much as I regret not saying anything sooner. I\\'m glad I did tell her, because how much long would it have been before anyone did?\\n\\nThis is my first post here, probably won\\'t be my last. Thank you.\\n\\nTL;DR:. Told my aunt her BF was cheating on her after months of knowing, hell broke, needed stitches.\\n\\nEdit: \\n\\nFirstly; God-sister is the term we used for her to describe her, it\\'s because she\\'s my god-mothers daughter, that\\'s just the short cut to it, not a cult or such, apologies for confusion! It adds to the insult towards my aunt as she was basically like a sister to Me, and a niece to her too.\\n\\nSecondly, I\\'m male 5\\'8\" while this guy was near on 7\\' and built like a brick shithouse. Not going to take a fight I know I\\'ll lose (especially with cameras on me)\\n\\nThirdly, in terms of legal actions, I know I have some evidence(Injury, CCTV footage off of the neighbours etc) but my first thought is making sure my aunt and cousins are okay.\\n\\nForth, my aunt has since had the baby, I wasn\\'t too sure how far along she was when I was told she was pregnant, believe end of 1st trimester.\\n\\n\\nTo all saying it doesn\\'t belong her etc, I hear you, but at the time of writing, I felt as if I had fucked up, with the treatment I got, I felt this was the appropriate place for it. \\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll get back with an update on this thread when I know what\\'s what, \\n\\nThank you all for your concerns, opinions and the awards, even though some of your thoughts go against my actions, I still respect you for voicing them! \\n\\n\\nLove to all Obligatory this did not happen today. This happened on Thanksgiving about 15 years ago when I was a young lad. My family always goes to my one Uncle\\'s house, and they have a big basement with a light switch at the top of the stairs. Me (22m), my brother, my sister, and my 8 cousins always played a game which we called \"Monster in the bathroom\". The game is just hide and seek, but all the lights are out and the people have to make a noise when the seeker asks them to. Also, we never play it in an actual bathroom, no idea why we call it that.\\n\\nSo we play a few games, the lights start on so people can find a good place to hide while the seeker stands at the top of the stairs and counts down. When they are finished counting, they turn out the light and make their way down the stairs to find people. My oldest cousin was the seeker this game, and he\\'s kinda known as the funny one of the bunch so I was presented an opportunity to out humor him.\\n\\nAs he was walking down the stairs, I suddenly got the urge to fart. I could tell this was a mammoth of a fart just by feel, so I was dying for him to ask for us to make a noise. Finally, as he got to the bottom of the stairs and screams loudly \"MAKE A NOISE!\" Trying to get a laugh out of everyone. Not to be outdone, I released the loudest and wettest fart I had ever released in my young life. Every single person hiding burst into hysterical laughter, including myself and the seeker.\\n\\nAfter the laughing died down, I realized my FU. My legendary fart was actually a shart, and I had wet shit dripping down my leg. The other FU was that even though everyone else stopped laughing after 30 seconds, I couldn\\'t stop. I laughed so hard that I also pissed my pants. My cousin immediately caught me, and it was revealed that I had simultaneously shit and pissed my pants. The game ended right there, because I had to go upstairs and borrow pants and underwear from my cousin.\\n\\nNow, every single year when my family arrives to Thanksgiving, every cousin comes up to me and yells \"HEY MAX30070, MAKE A NOISE!\" This has not gotten old to them, and I will be arriving at my Uncle\\'s house in about 2 hours. I will undoubtedly be asked to make a noise, as it is a Thanksgiving tradition from here till the day I die.\\n\\nTl;dr Played a game of hide and seek in the dark, was asked to make a noise, accidently shit and pissed myself, now I am reminded of it every Thanksgiving by cousins.\\n\\nEdit: my cousins are currently trolling me by saying \"lol dude this happened last year\" so at the ripe age of 21 I shit and pissed myself guys. GG me I guess.\\n\\nEdit 2: My sister just linked this to her Instagram story. Now everyone I know is gunna know this story lol\\n\\nEdit 3: Thanks for reading and to everyone who enjoyed my story! My mom can\\'t believe a story about me shitting myself became this popular lol. I posted this because I was sitting on my couch waiting for my family to get ready and thinking about how I was gunna get trolled when I got there. Then I thought it would make a funny TIFU story. Sorry to the people I haven\\'t responded to, I got tipsy and lost track of everything. Happy Thanksgiving! Unlike most TIFU posts, this happened just half an hour ago. \\n\\nI\\'m a 21 year-old male. I was out running my 2 miles. Headphones in, music playing, minding my own business. I round the corner at about the halfway point of the run and I see this big black duck looking at me. As I get closer, I think to myself, \"Man, that\\'s a brave duck, why isn\\'t he running away?\" I keep running and realize the duck not only isn\\'t afraid of me or running away, he\\'s running right at me. So I stop and squat down, thinking maybe he was hurt and needed help or something. This bitch ass giant fucking black duck takes a huge bite out of my leg. Like, not playing, drew blood kinda bite.\\n\\nI\\'m thinking to myself, \"What the fuck?\" So I\\'m like, maybe he\\'s just an asshole and I keep running think he will leave me alone. I start running again and the faster I run, the faster he chases me. I start sprinting and he is literally flying behind me attacking me. I\\'m thinking, \"I\\'ve got enough fucking problems in my life as it is man, I don\\'t need this shit\" so I stop running again kinda like in disbelief trying to figure out what to do. In all my years of being a person, I\\'ve never trained for this.\\n\\nThis little punk ass duck is chomping on my ankles and it\\'s actually really hurting. He starts grabbing my shoelaces and untying them as I\\'m trying to run backwards away from him. We\\'ve covered a quarter mile at this point. I try picking him up and throwing him back away from me every time he lunges for blood. I\\'m thinking, \"How the fuck am I gonna explain this if I have to go to the doctor for a duck attack? I\\'m a grown ass man. This is bullshit.\"\\n\\nI try running again and he keeps flying after me. I\\'m at a loss. I don\\'t know what to do at this point. I\\'m manage to get my phone and start texting my girlfriend, asking her what to do. Am I really gonna have to kill this duck to get away? Like, I don\\'t want to, but I might have to actually fucking kick this duck or grab it by the neck? Seriously?\" We have covered 3/4 of a mile at this point. He bites me again and I drop my phone. I pick it up quickly. Who do I call? I\\'ve got fucking scars and cuts all over me. While I\\'m debating whether stand-your-ground laws apply to ducks, I hear a noise; Someone else was outside walking on an adjacent street and came to see what all of the commotion was.\\n\\nThis was a big mistake. The duck smelled blood, and gave up attacking me to chase after my savior. I saw my window and booked it home running the last half mile in 2:50 flat. I feel kinda bad, that duck has probably killed that dude by now. The last I saw of him was the look I took over my shoulder running away as he made the same mistake I did, looking down to see if the duck was hurt.\\n\\nI cannot make this shit up. I would have recorded it, and I tried, but it\\'s really hard to concentrate on unlocking my phone and trying to record video while you\\'re being eaten by a fucking duck.\\n\\nThis is bullshit. I\\'m covered in cuts and bites. Most joggers are afraid of getting attacked by dogs, but this is something I was not ready for.\\n\\nTL;DR I\\'m a grown ass man and got attacked by a giant duck and chased for over half a mile. I\\'m covered in blood.\\n\\nEDIT: A small amount of proof from the initial moment of not realizing what was happening: https://imgur.com/a/SxZ7Y\\n\\nEDIT 2: ITT: People what don\\'t understand the difference between can\\'t fight a duck and *not wanting to fight a fucking duck.*\\n\\nEDIT 3: Not dead yet. this happened 30 minutes ago. literally. \\n\\non mobile so forgive me for my sins. \\n\\nso, my beagle/pug mix is 19 years old & he\\'s been my best friend my whole life cause I\\'m 22. so he\\'s all old & fucked up. been hit by a car more than once. \\nanyways, I was cleaning my T-bone steak of all it\\'s fat. the fat came out to be about an 8 inch long strip, since it wrapped all the way around my steak. I thought, \"man, Buster sure would enjoy the shit out of this steak fat!\". so I proceed to walk my happy-ass out onto the porch, where my beloved ancient pupper resides. I proceed to lay this strip into his bowl, where he (QUICKLY for his age & condition) gimps his old self over to it. let me add; he\\'s not one to just swallow some shit whole, so I didn\\'t expect this, but I suppose he was feeling risky. so he\\'s all excited as shit, gulping down this strip of fat, inch by inch. I\\'m watching him eat it cause I\\'m all stoked he\\'s enjoying himself & feeling good. \\n\\nthis is where it goes south. \\n\\nthe little fucker didn\\'t think about how many swallows it would take to down this 8 inch strip of steak fat. he\\'s running short of air & starts swaying, stumbling around like a drunk Irishman.   I instantly take action & start heimliching the fuck out of this little sausage link of a mummified dog. it was enough force to make the end of this fat strip peek out of his throat. so I grab the fucker & tug it out. he\\'s unresponsive & his eyes are all rolled back. I\\'m FREAKING THE FUCK OUT. so i start giving him CPR. (I don\\'t know how to do CPR for humans, let alone a dog, but I gave it my best shot). so he starts breathing again & looks at me like \"what the fuck just happened?!\". the amount of confusion on this dogs face is something that will be seared into my brain til the day I die. he lays there for a second & I rub his neck (assuming it might be sore from the good tug I gave to that t-bone fat strip). & this little fat fuck of a canine gets up as fast as he went down, walks over to the fat I ripped from his throat, & starts going at it again. but much slower & more cautious this time. I monitored him the whole time & then got him some water to wash it all down. I gave him some love & he went to sleep. \\n\\nmy life is seriously going to be very uneventful & boring when he leaves us. \\n\\nTL;DR I brought my 19 year old beagle pug back to life after he deep-throated a 8 inch long strip of t-bone steak fat.\\n\\nedit; wow, thank you for the silver, kind stranger ;-;\\n\\nedit; this post blew up. thank you so much for all the love, very pleased to know so many enjoyed.\\n\\nEDIT; everyone loves Buster so much, I\\'ve created an Instagram for him that I will be posting on regularly. link is in the comments cause idk if my p9st will get taken down if posted on main post. you wanted da cult? you got da cult. many more posts to come. This fuck up took place 15 years ago when I was around 11 years old.   I had recently seen my father\\'s penis for some reason as little boys often accidentally do.  It got me thinking about how small my penis was.    I decided I needed to do something about this.   I did some google searching and somehow learned about penis pumps.   \\n\\nNow, my 11 year old self didn\\'t really understand what this term meant.  I however knew that I had a penis, which had a hole, and I had a pump.   The pump I had, was a soccer ball pump.   The ones with the little metal needle.  Well I examined my dick hole and determined it could accept this metal object.   I stuck it in, it hurt a little bit.   I decided the pain would be worth it.   I pushed the pump handle down and pumped air in.   It inflated my urethra like a little balloon.   Since I was 11, I was not an anatomy expert.   The sensation gave me an erection, so I decided it must be working.  I inflated again.   It hurt a little this time, and now it felt like I had to pee.   I wanted results though, and people always say \"No pain, no game.\"   I pushed the handle down again.   Now I really fucking had to pee.\\n\\nI removed the needle and hobbled off to bathroom.   The sensation had given me a full on erection, the kind where it is hard to pee.   However, I really fucking had to pee.   I pushed super hard.   No man other than me likely knows the feeling of farting piss out of their penis.  I get to claim that I guess.   The air mixed with urine created a sprinkler effect spraying piss everywhere as the air and pee mixture escaped violently.   It really hurt my dickhole.   Amazingly the dickhole was not meant to rapidly expel air from a dick balloon.    I can confirm now that if a woman blows into your penis during a blowjob, you will not die.   Check mate weird middle school boy story tellers.\\n\\n15 years later it still hurts when I pee occasionally.  I am considering going to a urologist one day, however I am not sure how to address the issue.   The last thing I would want to tell a medical doctor is the actual reason why my dick hurts every now and then.  \\n\\nTLDR:   I thought my penis was too small so I inflated it like a balloon.    It hurt when I peed.  \\n\\n Dude [17] got his finger stuck in a plastic soda lid and was pretty much panicking about it and couldn’t get it off (he has serious anxiety). It was like that scene in the Saw movies or a Chinese finger trap. The more he tried to escape the worse it got. However!....He and his girlfriend just found out they were pregnant and I knew they were really stressed out about it, but my [27] insensitive ass pretty much yelled at him, “You’re about to have a child! If you can’t figure this out on your own you’re screwed.”\\nHis response, “She isn’t pregnant anymore.”\\n[she had obviously had an abortion or a miscarriage based on his facial expression]\\nI just about died inside...\\nAll the other coworkers just started laughing theirselves death. I apologized profusely and he took it well but I don’t know if I’ll ever forgive myself for it. Poor kid didn’t deserve that!!!\\n\\nTL;DR, coworker got physically stuck, I told him he won’t be a good father if he couldn’t get out of that situation......\\nEdit: for clarity/details\\nEditx2: I actually got an award for this?! Wtf is wrong with you people?!?!?!!!! Thanks?\\nAlso, on a happier note, we’ve been fine since this. I’ve helped him out a few times and yes, my coworkers are also assholes....... This actually happened about six months ago, but it\\'s time the story is told. Just to preface, my husband (24M) and I (25F) are very comfortable with each other. Especially when it comes to normal body functions such as pooping, burping, and farting. \\n\\nAnyway, one day about six months ago, I thought I was being really cute rocking the \"winnie the pooh\" (shirt w/ no bottoms.)  It started with a casual conversation while my husband was sitting on the toilet. I was standing outside of the bathroom, while the door was open, and we\\'re just chatting. I look at him straight in the eye, trying to be cute, and I went for a \"toot.\"\\n\\nGuys. This was not a fucking toot that came out of me. I looked my husband dead in the eye, thinking that I was cute and silly, THEN SHIT ON THE FUCKING FLOOR. Yup. Literally sharted. And because I was rocking the T-Shirt with no pants look, it had no where to go, but the floor. I was DEVASTATED. I thought I might be looking at divorce. I\\'ve never felt so humiliated. \\n\\nHusband here: At the moment of release I was looking her dead in the eye. I was expecting to hear a gnarly ass fart... all I heard was a wet plop/thud noise. It took my brain a second to process it, but as soon as I did I found myself looking at my wife in sheer/horror disbelief. The love of my life just shit on the floor like a filthy fucking animal. She turned bright red and slammed the door. I just sat on the toilet in disbelief.\\n\\nTL;DR I tried to he cute and toot with no pants on, and I shit on the floor while looking my husband dead in the eye. Before I start, I\\'m 100% straight. I was streaming to some friends on discord and we were messing around on the unmoderated section of Omegle. I would have my ass out and see if people would stop on me, then I would call them gay if they kept on jacking it. I found this one guy and he stayed for a long time and I had my ass out. My boxers were tight and I had them pulled up in my ass to look like a girl. In this process, my mom walked in because I was being loud and it was late at night. She knocked and then quickly walked in. She came in and said \"go to bed\" while seeing my ass out and the guy jerking off to me. We made eye contact and she stood there for a second. She looked back at guy and closed the door like she usually does. I\\'m currently sitting here pondering my life and what I should do next. I\\'m going to see her tomorrow after work and I have no clue what to do. Please help me.\\n\\nTLDR; showed my ass to a dude jerking it, mom walked in\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nUpdate: No my mom hasn\\'t said anything to me yet. I think she\\'s gonna act like it never happened and trusts that I know better now. I don\\'t plan on bringing it up anytime in the future unless it\\'s at my wedding. No, I\\'m not homophobic and have nothing toward gay people. We all just thought it was funny to see their faces when they saw it was a guy. If you are wondering, no I\\'m not planning on going back on Omegle and doing that again. I understand that it looks immature and ignorant but we were all just having fun. Lastly, I was never meaning gay in a negative or offensive way, it is 100% okay to be gay.  Not a huge fuck up, but amusing enough that I wanted to share  \\n\\nSo this story starts a ways back when I set up my Google account. I rarely use my real name online, and most of the time I enjoy using immature names like \\'Berry McCockinner\\' or \\'Howie Fildersnatch\\'. I decided to go with \\'Dixie Normus\\', and never thought twice about it. \\n\\nFast forward to a few weeks ago, my wife says I should start using the chick file a app since I eat there so often. So I sign up, and use my Google account to log in. Easy. \\n\\nSo over the last few weeks I cruise through the drive thru and scan my app and start accumulating points. Cool I guess. Never had an issue.\\n\\nToday I went in for lunch and the line for the drive thru was wrapped around the building, so I said fuck this imma go in and eat.\\n\\nThe line inside is long to 6, so I utilize the order online feature, and wait. \\n\\nThat poor woman didn\\'t even realize when she went to call my name. I wasn\\'t expecting it. I forgot all about signing up with my Google account. \\n\\n\"DIXIE NORMUS\"\\n\\nI felt worse for her than I did myself, the whole room stared at her, and I saw her show the receipt to co workers. I reluctantly walked up and grabbed my order, and walked out. \\n\\nLike I said, I know it\\'s not the biggest fuck up, but I\\'m still laughing about it so I thought I\\'d share. \\n\\nTL;DR I signed into my app through my Google account without remembering that I used Dixie Normus as my name, and the cashier at a crowded fast food restaurant called it out LOUD. Alright, so this happened \"yesterday\" so its technically  YIFU. But whatever. \\n\\nSo, a couple weeks ago i was swiping on el tinder when i saw a cute goth girl. Lets call her Lizzie. Anyways, i was fairly tired at that moment and only glanced over the bio. This was the fuckup. \\n\\nLizzie and i match and get to talking. She is really nice, into the same nerdy shit i am, a fantastic shitposter, good conversationalist. and Very,Very cute. I\\'m thinking she is already my next girlfriend assuming things go well when we meet.\\n\\nCouple days later we go on the date. Now, I\\'ve been catfished before, so I\\'m already expecting that she won\\'t be as cute as she was online. Nope. She shows up looking fantastic. (Just like in the simulations!) We get sushi and are having a good time, so we decide to go back to my place. \\n\\n After a drink, some anime and good conversation, we start making out. Things are getting...heavy so we go into my room, she takes off my pants and starts giving me head. Awesome.  She took off her bra, not flat chested either, double awesome. (BIG TITTY GOTH GF REEEE) Anyways I\\'m not the type to keep a girl waiting on her knees. (*tips fedora*) So i ask her to get on the bed and we make out some more and i go to take off her skirt. The next few moments were something like this:\\n\\n\"Uhh... whatcha got there..?\"\\n\\n\"Oh my god i thought you knew\"\\n\\n*windows shutdown noice as my boner collapses*\\n\\n\"..nope. I had no clue\"\\n\\nSoooooo, she had a dick. Turns out, she did say she was trans in her bio. Pre op.  Been on hormones for a while and is going to make the switch. While im not transphobic or homophobic, i do have boundaries. I didn\\'t freak out or anything. I assured her its fine, y\\'know shit happens. We ended up getting dressed, knocking back a few more shots and exchanging life stories until she sobered up and went home. Ended up friends after all was said and done. \\n\\nAlways. Read. Bios.\\n\\nTLDR: didn\\'t read a tinder bio, got my dick sucked by a pre op trans girl. Took off her skirt, saw a dick.\\n\\nEDIT: This is my first ever post on reddit. Cant believe its made so many people laugh. Glad more people got something out of my potentially awkward situation!\\n\\nEDIT: A lot of people asked if i would consider dating her post op. Yeah. Why not? I felt like we hit it off. \\n\\n UPDATE: she replied. Verified this is \"Lizzie\"\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/b1o3uc/tifu_by_not_reading_a_tinder_bio/eiokl6i?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share obligatory this was a few years ago.\\n\\nI work in the IT field, and have always been handy with computers.\\nGrowing up, when I lived in my parents house, I did computer repair here and there, and often had many computer parts and accessories with me.\\nWhen I left my parents house, I ended up leaving a few things behind in my room.\\n\\nMy brother was still living with my parents at the time, and he has been known to dabble in illegal activities. So my mom is already on the paranoid side of things.\\n\\nFast forward about 2 years, and I get a frantic (frantic) call from my mom.\\n\\n\"I found a syringe in your room, and I think it\\'s for drugs, but youre brother keeps lying to me and says it\\'s yours! DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?!?\"\\n\\nI ask some leading questions, and ask her what my brother said it was.\\n\\n\"He\\'s saying it\\'s for a computer, but I know better!\"\\n\\nOk, is any writing on it? Does it have a needle?\\n\\n\"There\\'s no needle, and there is a company name on the side\"\\n\\nOk, well whats the company name? and did you google it?\\n\\n\"It says thermaltek on the side. And when I went to google it, all it came up with was computer parts! I know you don\\'t use syringes for computers!!!\"\\n\\nOk, so let\\'s walk through this together ok?\\n\\n1. You found said syringe and he said it was for a computer, and it was mine\\n2. You googled the company name and all you found were computer parts\\n3. you found it in my room\\n4. you know I work on computers\\n5. and there was no needles\\n\\nIt\\'s thermal paste mom. It\\'s used to apply a thin layer of paste for heat dispersion on the processor and graphics card. You\\'re screaming at him over thermal paste. If it quacks like a duck, if it walks like a duck, if it swims like a duck.... Did you ever stop to think that maybe, just maybe he was telling the truth?\\n\\n\"Oh\" *click*\\n\\nI give my brother a call to let him know what I just told my mom, and so he can never let her live it down.\\n\\ntl;dr I forgot thermal paste in my room before I moved out, and my mom found it and instantly assumed my brother was shooting up heroin, and almost kicked him out, then wouldnt believe him after literally every piece of evidence was telling her otherwise. So we were leaving on a trip a few months ago. I work night shift. We were leaving as soon as I got home. I’d get home around 6am and then sleep in the car while my wife drives. This saves us a bunch of time. \\nI remembered something I forgot to tell my 13 year old son. He’s the oldest of 4. So I text him, not even realizing that it’s like 1 in the morning. \\n\\nDidn’t think anything of it but I get a call about an hour later from my wife. She’s laughing so hard she can hardly tell me what happened. \\nMy son got the text but was so sleepy he didn’t even think about what the noise was. He assumed it was his alarm and got up to get ready. Well he wakes the other three and tells them it’s time to go. So he showers and gets ready. They all get up, get dressed and get their luggage ready. \\nHe goes to get my wife and doesn’t know why she’s still in bed. She’s always the first up. \\nThen he looks at the clock and it’s like 2am. Then he sees my text and realizes it wasn’t his alarm. \\n\\nI guess I’m lucky he’s so responsible. \\n\\ntl;dr\\nWas leaving on a trip early. I work the night shift and texted my son in the middle of the night. He woke everyone up and made them get ready cause he thought the text notification was his alarm. Mandatory this didn\\'t happen today, but rather a few years ago...\\n\\nBack when I was at Uni my best friend (James) and I used to always try prank each other creatively by getting on each other\\'s Facebooks/social media. Think things like messaging our friends with odd messages trying to sell them a ridiculous pyramid scheme , changing each other\\'s profile picture, etc... you get the idea.\\n\\nOne day near the end of my final year, we are in his room about to go for a night out and James goes to the bathroom, leaving his laptop unlocked (with facebook logged in). I take this as my opportunity to execute my latest master plan - I was going to change his post settings on facebook to \"only me\" (i.e. his posts would be invisible to anyone else) and post something outrageous and completely inappropriate (knowing he has his family on facebook). Plan was that he would come in, see the post and freak out / get super pissed, for me to reveal the gaff to him and have a laugh.\\n\\nHowever, I only managed to execute the first part of my plan (i.e. changing the setting to \"only me\") before he came back into the room, and I had to quickly exit facebook to avoid being found out.\\n\\nNow, the fuck up was that we went out, got quite drunk, came back home, and I COMPLETELY forgot about this prank. Fast forward to almost a year later...\\n\\nMy friend is still at Uni (doing a masters degree) while I have moved to another city and started working. I should add that James is a big time electric guitar player, and in the last year got into recording videos of himself and posting them on youtube / social media. He messages me one day asking what I thought of his latest video on facebook. I went to his page and noticed there was no post... in fact, there were no posts for around a year...\\n\\nI call him and tell him there\\'s no post, to which he says that can\\'t be, I posted it yesterday and am looking at the post now. I\\'m on the phone with him when it suddenly just \\\\*clicks\\\\* and I am immediately MORTIFIED - This entire time, I had left the \"only me\" setting on, and he hadn\\'t realised. I hang up to compose myself before calling him back and telling him the truth.\\n\\nFor the last year or so, he had been posting several videos and had received 0 likes or comments. He had taken most of his previous videos down, had wondered why nobody liked his videos, if people just hated him since most of his friends graduated, if he was really crap at guitar... One thing he told me in particular was particularly heart-breaking - \"I often layed awake at night thinking about this\". I don\\'t want to use the term depression too loosely, but it really affected him and he considered going for counselling.\\n\\nLuckily he was good about it and didn\\'t hold a grudge, and we now laugh about it. Bought him a lot of drinks next time I saw him though.\\n\\nTL;DR  Forgot I changed my friend\\'s facebook settings so that nobody else could see his posts, he thought nobody liked him and was mildly depressed for a year.\\n\\nEdit: Grammar\\n\\nEdit 2: I should add that I was of course extremely apologetic and remorseful after this happened, and still feel terrible when I think about it. He understandably was pissed at first, but realised it was completely accidental and was just a colossal fuck up. The \"reveal\" itself was over 6 months ago, I was reminded earlier today when I saw an obvious \"stupid facebook prank\". We still talk amost daily, and he is staying with me until he finds a flat once he also moves to the same city as me for work in a couple weeks (will make sure to keep my laptop locked though...)\\n\\nEdit 3: Just to clarify, he wasn\\'t just starting to play guitar. He has played since he was a kid and is genuinely a great guitar player. During his masters, he started filming cover videos/recordings as a hobby. His videos now get several likes and complimentary comments\\n\\nEdit 4: So a lot of people have been asking for posting a link to his videos. After watching this blow up, I called my friend and linked him the reddit. He is amazed and wants everyone to know he\\'s fine. He isn\\'t keen on me sharing his actual profile for privacy reasons, but said I could post some (starting with one) of his videos on a separate youtube account and linking it to this post. Here is the cover he wanted to share with me that exposed the fuck up: [https://youtu.be/eH\\\\_m88IUoVk](https://youtu.be/eH_m88IUoVk).\\n\\nEdit 5: Final video, a much newer cover he did for his girlfriend: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDpMmSuNoI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHDpMmSuNoI) This is a throwaway. My fuck up is far too extreme to put on my main account, and you’ll learn why quickly. \\n\\nThis happened about 30 minutes ago. I am currently sitting in the hospital, alone, feeling defeated. I have done this to myself. \\n\\nSo I’ll start with some backstory. I’m a closeted gay 18 year old boy living with his parents. I’m in high school, but just got off for Christmas break. About a month ago, I was scrolling through Wish (that shopping app where everything is insanely cheap) to see if I could find any funny gifts to get my family for Christmas. Though, lots and lots of sex toys kept popping up. I had never purchased one and since they were so cheap, I figured “Why the hell not?”.  It was a small dildo. \\n\\nIt took about 3 weeks to arrive, which was actually earlier than expected. I wasn’t surprised, since most of my past orders from Wish came sporadically. I opened it up and it reeked of a chemical odor. I expected there to be some smell, assuming that it was made out of silicon, but damn did it smell awful. I took a shower that day and decided to clean it thoroughly while I was in there. The smell never completely went away, but it got less pungent. \\n\\nWhen I got back to my room, I started searching for a good place to hide it. My room has endless nooks and crannies to hide things in, so it wasn’t really an issue. I placed it in a shoebox in the corner of my closet and left it there. \\n\\nFast forward to today. I had completely forgotten about the dildo because school had me constantly busy and worried about a million different things at all times.  But now it was Saturday, christmas break, and a ton of free time on my hands. I was laying in bed on my phone and randomly remembered about it, so I decided I would finally use it tonight. \\n\\nThe night rolls around, and both my parents went to sleep. Perfect. I went in my closet, pulled out the dildo, and pulled up some porn on my computer. It was all going well for about 30 minutes, until I felt an itch coming from inside my butthole. I pulled it out, looked at it, and there were ANTS crawling out of the dildo’s pee hole. The makers of the dildo thought it would be a good idea to put an actual hole in the dildo for some godforsaken reason. I didn’t know how to react, so I just sat there, staring at it for a good 30 seconds. After my brain processed what the fuck had just happened, I ran to the bathroom and sat on the toilet. I tried to push, but nothing felt like it was coming out. I kept trying for a couple minutes, but still nothing. So I finally stood up, bent down to flush the toilet, and saw AT LEAST 50 ants just chilling in the water. I. Was. Mortified. \\n\\nI could still feel that itch in my butt, so I decided I needed to go to the hospital. I didn’t want any ants crawling up my god damn rectum. I wasn’t about to tell my parents what happened, so in my frantic state I just left.  Got in my car, and went to the hospital. \\n\\nSo here we are. I can definitely say telling the doctor what happened is the most embarrassing thing I have ever had to do. I’m writing this here because I need to tell someone what happened. My parents are at home, sound asleep, probably dreaming about me leaving for college. I don’t know what I’ll do when they wake up, I don’t know how long I’ll be here, I don’t really know what the hell happens after this. \\n\\nFuck me.\\n\\nTL;DR: Used a cheap Chinese dildo. Put it in my closet, ants invaded it like suburban moms invading the hand sanitizers at Bath & Body Works. Used it, ants up the ass. Chilling at hospital.\\n\\nEDIT: The long awaited update is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/eeecdy/tifupdate_by_trusting_a_cheap_chinese_toy_to_do/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). Most TIFUS don\\'t get posted the same day they happened, this one is no different.\\nFlash back 3 and a half years ago to our fall league of softball. My wife\\'s family always has a softball team every year in their church league and our team consists of my wife, her 3 other sisters, their husband\\'s, my father in law, myself and normally one random girl that normally changes from year to year.\\n\\nJust a little back story, my wife is 135 lbs but also has a generously large behind for her size and I being a male, enjoy smacking it for obvious reasons. (told you it was a little back story) \\n\\nCut to me making the 3rd out by catching a fly ball in left center and jogging into the dugout behind everyone. Upon reaching the dug out, I see my wife in front of me walking in. I decided to take my baseball glove, reach back, and slap her on the ass.  Immediately something felt off. I\\'ve smacked my wife\\'s ass a lot, she enjoys it and she knows I enjoy it. The reciprocating ripple that normally can be felt when slapping her behind normally was not felt. My wife\\'s sister turns around (who is much much MUCH more conservative when it comes to intimacy or even being premiscoous) and my jaw drops. \\n\"I.. Uh... Thought you were.. Zelda\" I babbled \\nI start panicking because I just spanked my sister in law\\'s ass in front of the entire game and didn\\'t want to be murdered by my wife. I turn some shade of red and started contemplating how to injure myself so I could get away from my soon to be death. \\nLuckily my wife and all of her sisters are practically clones of each other, blonde hair blue eyes, and extremely beautiful (my wife being the best out of them all) they have been mistaken for each of the other ones their entire lives.\\nThey all laugh and I am still made fun of every time we play. I now always make sure to look at my wife\\'s face prior to spanking her bottom (in public) \\n\\nMy wife loves bringing this story up to embarrass me now. \\n\\nTL:DR smacked my wife\\'s sister on the ass because they all look the same and have the same body types, didn\\'t get murdered but get made fun of to this day for it still Yea yea what a nerd, he collects the periodic table.\\n\\nWell I do, it’s not the largest but contains some of the more interesting or rare elements. It sits in a display case in my room, and looks like this\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/DRj8sjr\\n\\nSo the fuck up begins when I order the element Cobalt. It has to ship from Italy where I get the elements + jars, and it arrived broken.\\nI emailed them, and they responded [in a very wholesome and google translated email](https://i.imgur.com/V5vODvy.jpg) saying they would replace the jar. \\n\\nSo the jar arrives and I transfer the cobalt sample from some other storage container into it’s designated jar. Everyone would be fine if it stays in the jar. My girlfriend is at my house at the time, and I hand it to her to put in the display case, which she spends a while at.\\n\\n I assume she’s looking at some of the cooler samples like gold, platinum, or gallium,  I think nothing of it. Later on her hand gets really red and itchy. Like reeallly bad. It looks like she stuck her hand into poison ivy.\\nShe’s in a lot of irritation and some pain and I think I know the cause.\\n\\n“Did you take the cobalt out of its jar”\\n\\n“Yea I held it and looked at it”\\n\\nI know she did more than that, probably shook it around in her hand or something.\\nFor those of you who don’t know, cobalt has an effect called “contact dermatitis” which basically means, you touch it, and it makes you really uncomfortable. Once you have one reaction, you’ll most likely develop a lifelong allergy. Cobalt also known to cause cancer, but only with frequent contact. \\n\\nSo now her hand was feeling a bit better but it looked terrible. There wasn’t much anyone could do, so that sucks for her.\\nI had to deal with the fact that I handed her a very toxic metal and didn’t tell her. Yay for me. Major fuck up and I’m an idiot. \\n\\nTL;DR I handed my girlfriend a toxic metal and she touched it causing a painful reaction and probably gave her a lifelong allergy to it. Oh and the metal also causes cancer.\\n\\n*Edit:* Ok also I want to to throw this in there, that this probably won’t be that much of a problem. She doesn’t want to study chemistry, and how many times in your life will you come into contact with elemental cobalt? Yea, zero. It would have to be pure elemental cobalt, not alloys. She wasn’t mad about it either, we laugh about it.\\n\\nEdit 2: I need to be more specific about the allergy. Everyone will have a reaction to cobalt. We are all allergic. But after your first serious exposure, you’re significantly more sensitive to it. I didn’t really _give_ her an allergy, I just made her more vulnerable to cobalt. Also, don’t blame her. This is my fault and I should have been more clear. She is a smart person and it’s not her fault. This is TIFU not “Today someone else fucked up”\\n\\nEdit 3: so more people are expressing interest in element collecting rather than in expressing sympathy for my poor girlfriend. I created a sub, r/CollectingElements to start you people up. In case you were curious, here are my current elements and the _cursed cobalt_ \\nhttps://imgur.com/a/QXVH8tk Greatest/worst thing ever just happened to me, so buckle up folks..it\\'s story time:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGirl on a dating app tells me in the first few messages that I\\'m really cute (true) and interesting (also true) and asks me to meet her at 1140am for coffee at a random McDonald\\'s. When I ask if she\\'s a 45 year old man trying to harvest my organs, she proceeds to send me 15 pictures in a row that look like they\\'re straight from Facebook. Because that\\'s how you convince somebody you\\'re real (not true).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNow normally I don\\'t accept propositions like this because I\\'m thinking \"what\\'s the catch?\" Well, I decide to live a little on the YOLO side...and since it\\'s right next to a Subway Sandwich shop I think that the worst that could happen is it\\'s a 45 year old lonely man, I give him a big hug because I know the feeling as a 25 year old lonely man, get a tasty sandwich, then go home. Apparently that was NOT the worst thing that could happen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI show up. She shows up. She\\'s real. I\\'m surprised. I buy her coffee because I subscribe to traditional gender roles unless requested otherwise. She uses her McCafe frequent buyers card so she gets stamps. Its cute. While the guy is making her drink, she tells me to go find a table outside in the sun. I go outside and find the perfect goddamn table because I\\'m a romantic at heart. 5 minutes later. 10 minutes later. 15 minutes later. No girl. I text her the typical guy message \"lol u get lost???\". No response. Turns out she took the coffee and left.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSo I\\'m not saying it\\'s bad to leave a date if you feel uncomfortable or aren\\'t attracted to them. It\\'s totally your decision. But I don\\'t think that\\'s the case...I think this girl is a serial McCafe dater. And I don\\'t think this was her first time. It was too professional. Too clean. It was the perfect McHeist. And I\\'m starting to think I\\'m not even mad...she didn\\'t steal my credit card, or my organs. Just a few euros.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAnd my heart.\\n\\n([for those who can\\'t read good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLu-wIaSRC8) /u/CyaeLDobson) So, a couple years ago my little Sister got a new backpack, and instead of cleaning out the old one and throwing it away, she shoved it in the coat closet. Today, I had the lovely priviledge of finding it and cleaning it out\\n\\nThe first outstanding thing I found was a home packed lunch that had been left to rot in a closet for 2 years. From the looks of it, my sister had not touched the food, so it was all there, gathering immense amounts of mold and turning to mush.\\n\\nAfter throwing away 3 or 4 bags of unidentifiable fruits and vegetables, I came across the thermos. Why I didnt follow my gut instinct to throw this thing out is beyond me at this point, but I made an attempt to open it. I tried to unscrew the cap, with absolutely no success. Trying a little harder, again I went to unscrew it. At this point the bottle was taunting me, it had waged a war that it already knew it had won. I was pulling out every trick imaginable, running it under hot water, using a towel for better grip, tapping it against a hard surface, but the capsule remained vigilant.\\n\\nI finally admitted defeat and turned to get reinforcements, but this is the exact moment that it had been waiting for. After I got about 10 feet from the sink, I heard an explosion. A wave of pure nauseating, vile putridness hit my nose before I even heard the cap hit the floor! The microbes had been preparing for this moment for two years, and I unsuspectingly activated their trap card. My eyes were watering and I was futally attempting to suppress the gagging that ensued. I have smelt many awful things in my life, skunk, weed, rotting human feces, but none have left NEARLY as deep of a scar as what I have experienced today. The only way I can describe the smell is pure danger. My nose was screaming biohazard.\\n\\nI ran back to the sink to finish what I had started and dumped probably and inch or two of soap on the mac and cheese that was left rotting twice through the summer, fall, winter and spring in a pathetic attempt to mask the smell. I dumped the vile blob down the irrigator, praying that I would live. I could feel the life force draining from me as the smell continued to permeate my nose.\\n\\nI retreated from the house for a couple hours, begging that the smell had left, but the faint smell of rotten dairy still lurked in the house. I dont know how long exactly it took, but it eventually dissipated and I\\'ve been left only with the scar of my stupidity.\\n\\nTLDR: I opened a thermos filled with rotting mac and cheese, only to be assaulted by the worst smell I have ever experienced.\\n\\nEDIT: To those questioning my use of weed as a bad smell, it smells awful to me. I get that some people might really enjoy it, but to me you might as well hold a skunk up to my nose.\\n\\nEDIT 2: its come to my attention that there is a difference between the smell of buds and the smell of smoke. For clarification, when I say weed, I am referring to the smoke. We are at my grandparents this weekend to visit family. I notice him get out of bed and head towards the stairs. In my half asleep state I let him go. About a minute later I realized I fucked up and should have followed him. He had no reason to head to the stairs. He comes back down and I see him rummaging through what I thought was his backpack. Turns out he completely unpacked my entire suitcase looking for underwear. My stupid ass finally realizes he\\'s sleepwalking and I wake him up gently. I ask him what he is doing and he said \"I went to the bathroom\". It\\'s at this point I start panicking and ask where he went to the bathroom. He realizes too and says \"I don\\'t know\". So here it is 4am. I have scanned my grandparents entire house and can\\'t find the urine. But I know it\\'s there. And I lie here, waiting to hear the scream from someone finding it with their foot, having to come clean, and become disinvited from future family gatherings. \\n\\nTldr; husband peed somewhere in my grandparents house and I can\\'t find it Short and sweet one: Today, my girlfriend and I were presented the rare treat of an empty apartment, and thus decided to get nice and loud.  As she was riding me cowgirl, I decided to give her ass a nice hard slap; however, as we were being rougher than usual, she was bouncing up and down in a manner that made it hard to hit her bum.  Thus, on my attempt at spanking her, my hand instead collided against my left testicle.  Instantly, a pain shot through the core of my very being, causing me to cry out in pain.  My girlfriend, being the epitome of love and sympathy that she is, immediately collapsed on the bed cackling like a mad witch while I cradled my bruised babymakers.\\n\\nTl;dr: Attempted a blind slap on a quickly moving bum, bitchslapped my testicles instead.\\n\\nEdit: apparently, everyone has been slapping their testicles lately, so I\\'ll just go ahead and say that my left nut and I sincerely wish I WAS reposting. This happened to me 30 minutes ago and I didn\\'t know what to do some I am going to chronicle it here.\\n\\nIt all started with my son asking if I could use AirPlay to stream some League of Legends games to his T.V. since Worlds are going on. I was reluctant at first since it was almost his bedtime, however I figured what the hell I do things like that all the time so I should go ahead and let him watch until 12ish. He tells me what games he wants to watch and I set up the connection and explain to him that I would let him stay up until 12, however he isn\\'t to tell his mom because she would kill me since his bed time is 10.\\n\\nMy wife works from home and does most of her work at night while everyone is in bed because me and my son are \"loud and obnoxious\". At the time of the incident she is in her office, which is across the hall from my son\\'s room, with the door locked while she is working. I was watching some Carnival Row and I said to myself \"self, now is an opportune time to stroodle the ole noodle. I pull out my phone and go to my incognito mode, ;) gotta be safe, and precede to search me out a suitable video. After a few minutes of searching I found some material and decided to go ahead and start it while I gathered the appropriate tools for the job. I press play and lay my phone on the bed and go grab some lotion and tissues. I jump back into bed placed my items beside of me and reached for my phone. That is when I realized it. I am panicking, FUCK FUCK FUCK, across my screen it has airplay and my son\\'s T.V. was selected. 2 minutes has passed in the video and I thought ok maybe nothing has showed yet so I change it back to league and started to gather myself to go talk to him.\\n\\nThat is when I hear it. My wife is screaming to the top of her lungs and I hear my son pleading with her and I here him say something about dad (you little tattle tale). She is on a war-path now. uh oh. I start panicking \"oh shit oh shit oh shit\" it is like getting caught watching porn by your own mom. Then things go silent and I know she is coming for me I hastily throw the tissues and lotion under the bed and roll over and try to pretend I went to sleep. She kicks the door open, and I pressing my head through my pillow at this moment. She screams my name. My mind went blank and I made a snoring sound. That was probably the real fuck up. I heard her say, \"oh this bitch going to pretend to be asleep, ok ok.\" I decided I needed to answer her or I am a dead man. I rolled over and said ....yea? At this point I am waiting for her to make like a cartoon and turn into a steam whistle. She precedes to chew me a new one. To paraphrase something like \"here I am working then I hear people fucking across the hall and come to find out your streaming porn to his room, blah blah irresponsible, blah blah dumbass, blah blah sleeping on the couch\". She storms off and I heard her office door slam. I gather a blanket and my pillow and go to the couch, my son\\'s door is shut and I don\\'t want to press my luck as I walk by. I head to the couch and thought you know this needs to go to TIFU and here I am. Hopefully she doesn\\'t smother me in my sleep lol.\\n\\nThanks for the silver and gold kind strangers, you honor me. WoW and platinum, thanks a lot. :D\\n\\nEdit/update 1: WoW, woke up and this post really blew up. Wife woke me up this mourning so we could talk about what happened lol. She wasn\\'t upset by the porn, she was upset because she thought our son had porn blasting on his T.V. at 12 at night while he was suppose to be asleep and interrupting her work. Which escalated when she found out that I told him he could stay up until 12 and I, in fact, was the one who did the Porn streaming. Which escalated when she opened the door and I was pretending to be asleep. One thing I wanted to address is that she is by no means a bitch, she is an amazing and wonderful woman that just lost her cool. We have all been there at some point. We don\\'t have an abusive relationship. She is the authoritarian in the house and I am a bit of a goofball, however we are fine with that as we rarely have a disagreement and compliment each other very well.\\n\\nUpdate 2: Talked to my son while taking him to school and he finds the situation hilarious and can\\'t wait to tell his friends. When I told him I can\\'t believe he threw me under the bus he told me I would do the same and he is right.\\n\\nUpdate 3: Sorry I have no intention of linking the \"sauce\" some mysteries are better left unsolved.\\n\\nTL:DR I was using Airplay to stream videos to my sons room while he was suppose to be sleeping, decided to spank it and accidentally streamed porn to my son\\'s room while my wife was right across the hall from him. This literally happened about 15 minutes ago. I was walking behind this lady pushing a pram with a kid inside playing with a helium  balloon. I suddenly see her baby accidentally let go of his balloon so I instantly turn on my hero-mode and extend my hand to grab the balloon string. It was a really epic and glorious moment and in my mind I was already playing out how cool I looked and how the lady would thank me for saving the balloon. Unfortunately, I did not manage to grab it in time. I did however end up with my hand in a closed fist straight into another man\\'s cheek who was walking next to me. Now there\\'s a crying baby in front of me and a very shocked, confused and upset stranger beside me. I think after the initial shock he did realise I was only trying to do a good deed so he didn\\'t say anything to me but either way I immediately slowed down in embarrassment  and let them walk ahead of me...I am the hero this city does not need.\\n\\nTL;DR Tried to save a baby\\'s balloon from flying away but ended up punching a stranger in the face. So this happened yesterday, but still, close enough I say. \\n\\nSo I wake up on a fine Sunday morning and my lovely wife snuggles into me for a cuddle. We\\'re comfortable enough with each other that farting is not really an issue so I let one rip.\\n\\nThis was quite possibly the best fart I\\'ve ever done. I swear the covers lifted a fraction from the sheer force.\\n\\nMy wife looks up with a mix of admiration and disgust at the stupid grin on my face and inspiration strikes. I quickly grab the blanket and pull it over her head. Brilliant! Or so I thought.\\n\\nActing far quicker than I ever thought possible she manages to kidney punch me, escape from the blankets, drag them up over my head and drop the dirtiest fart I\\'ve ever smelt right in my face.\\n\\nAs a little extra flavour, my wife is lactose intolerant, and also in denial about her lactose intolerance. The phrase \\'a little bit won\\'t hurt\\' is her life motto. Often followed by horrible bloating and gas.\\n\\nThe previous night she had eaten a bunch of pizza and chocolate. I couldn\\'t breathe.\\n\\nTo add insult to injury she then called in my two little devilspawn daughters and told them to jump on me, causing me to gasp as two seperate impacts rocked me under the bed.\\n\\nNeedless to say I won\\'t be trying that stunt again for a while.\\n\\nTl;dr: tried to Dutch oven my wife and she won.\\n\\nEdit: holy crap this blew up. Thanks for all the love guys. Yes, I know that my wife is amazing and I have no idea how she\\'s put up with me for 8 years of marriage.\\n\\nEdit again: A lot of people have asked so I did a bit of research. Apparently the term comes from the 17th century when the British and the Dutch fought a bunch of wars and the British started coming up with slang and insults for the Dutch. That\\'s where stuff like \\'double Dutch\\' comes from too. It\\'s derived from the Dutch oven crockpot that keeps all the smells and heat in. Posted this on AITA but someone said that it’s TIFU material. Also, they removed my post but anyway; \\n\\nOne of my wife’s friends has cancer. She’s been undergoing chemotherapy and as a result has lost all of her hair. Yesterday my wife was with her and one other friend. They decided that they’d shave off all their hair to support their friend and cheer her up. And they did. It’s a great gesture and all, but I wasn’t aware of this. \\n\\nI was working on my laptop on the bed when my wife comes up and asks me if I find bald women attractive. I wasn’t looking at her and hadn’t seen that *she* was bald, so I say, ‘Nope. Not my type. Not attracted at all. Why?’ Then I look up and, lo and behold, my wife was bald. Not a single hair on her head. I was so shocked my face could’ve probably become a viral meme. \\n\\nShe says that I don’t find her attractive now and starts crying. I try to salvage the situation by telling her that I don’t find *other* bald women attractive, but she looked hot without hair. She told me I was lying. I tell her that it’s just hair and will grow back. This was apparently not a good thing to say as she started crying again. \\n\\nMy mom, who’s been living with us, told me I’m an ass for making her cry. Wife slept in a different room. She’s been also looking in the mirror quite often. I’ve tried telling her that I don’t care about the hair and she did a great thing supporting her friend but she says that I’ve given her a small insecurity issue for the time being. \\n\\nTL;DR wife asks me if I find bald women attractive, I say no without looking. When I look up, wife was bald.\\n\\nEdit : Wow this blew up. Since some of y’all are asking, she’s not generally this emotional. Just that her friend probably won’t survive the cancer and has limited time. That’s been messing up with her state of mind lately.\\n\\nEdit 2: Everyone wants me to shave my head. Not happening. Nope. I quite like my head full of hair. What if it never grows back lmao? Obligatory this was not today, but in fact yesterday.\\n\\nYesterday was my (f25) husband’s (m26) birthday and I decided to give him an early birthday present by waking him up with a blowjob. Well, he sure as hell woke up when he instead of ejaculating in my mouth, accidentally peed. So instead of a nice, cozy birthday morning cuddling in bed I had to rush to the toilet, mouth filled with pee. Thankfully we are comfortable enough with each other to be able to just laugh it off afterwards and the rest of the day went great with other (dry) activities, gifts and dinner at his favourite restaurant. \\n\\nTL;DR: TIFU by deciding to give husband a blowjob to wake him up on his birthday. He then accidentally peed in my mouth. We laughed it off, remaining day went great. \\n\\nEdit: spelling and grammar\\n\\nEdit 2: please stop sending me personal messages with questions about my husband’s penis lol\\n\\nEdit 3: lmao @ you guys accusing me of raping my husband. It’s like you didn’t even know that communication between two humans exist lol. He has literally asked me multiply times before to wake him up with a blowjob. This wasn’t the first time I have woken him up like this either and he has always enjoyed it and encouraged me to surprise him with it again. Just happened 15 minutes ago.\\n\\nSo this evening was much like any other (well, any other quarantine evening). I wrapped work at home, my girlfriend & I walked the dog around the park, and then went back to the apartment to relax before dinner. We were missing a few key dinner items (beer) so I ran to the store to pick them up. When I got back home and walked through the door, my girlfriend (who is the best) had dressed up in full sexy teacher regalia (see) - skirt, glasses and all. Fuck. Yes.\\n\\nAs things were just about to get started, my phone rang. I wasn\\'t about to interrupt what was going down so I naturally ignored the call. Ah, but then the text tone. And then my girlfriend\\'s text tone. We checked and it turned out it was a good friend dropping off food gifts but couldn\\'t get into the apartment building. I hated to pause but it was super sweet of her so, as the one not in costume, I ran down. My flaw here (and don\\'t judge me guys) is that me and this friend started to catch up a little bit and suddenly 20 minutes had gone by. Damnit. I hurried myself back to the apartment but when I walked in she was no longer on the couch - she was dicing jalapenos, finishing making guacamole in the kitchen, still in costume. I loved it, don\\'t get me wrong, but also had other intentions. I think the more astute of you might know where this is going...\\n\\nWe wound up getting hot and heavy in the kitchen and moved to the bedroom. We started with hand play, she went down on me, then I went down on her. All was right with the world. And then I started to feel an uncomfortable tingle on my nethers, a strengthening tingle, god-like, especially on my huevos. And all of a sudden I\\'m on fire.\\n\\nI didn\\'t want to kill the mood. I really didn\\'t. I tried to power through for another 30 seconds, but eventually it occurred to me that a.) this wasn\\'t going away and b.) when we did get to where we were going, she was going to catch the pain too. I paused and looked up:\\n\\n\"Babe...did you wash your hands after you cut up those jalapenos?\" \"Yeah...why?..oh...\" \"Babe, I...\" and suddenly I just started laughing as the heat continued to grow. \"I gotta go!\"\\n\\nI ran straight to the bathroom and started to wash things off. She ran in after me, apologizing the whole way. As I stood balls-to-sink, she rummaged through her bathroom cabinet looking for remedies.\\n\\n\"Aloe, aloe\" \"I know, I know\"\\n\\nFinally she pulled out an old bottle with \"ALOE\" in giant letters across it. Sweet baby Jesus, yes. I palmed up and slapped it on. As I waited for relief to wash over, I felt something else entirely. An even stronger burn. We look at the bottle and notice the subtext under \"ALOE\"...it says \"with lidocaine\". Between the jalapeno and the lidocaine, my balls were somewhere between the 4th of July and the Chinese New Year.\\n\\nAfter much rinsing, laughter, and a few tears, I am now on the couch with an ice pack on my balls watching Netflix. I feel mostly back to normal but it has been quite the ride. In another hour or so, I might even be fully functional again. Who knows?\\n\\nHappy Thursday everyone!\\n\\ntl;dr - girlfriend cooked in a kink, brought my balls to the brink, and I wound up washing twice in the bathroom sink.\\n\\n\\n\\nUPDATE - Well this has been a fun surprise! Many thanks to all for the comments and involvement. We read many of them in morning before work, laughing our asses off the whole time. A few updates. 1.) I am completely back to normal after my brush with the fires of the underworld 2.) I am now much more educated on what lidocaine is thanks to you trusty folks! I checked the back of the bottle and I now highly suspect it was the spearmint leaf oil that doubled my fun. 3.)  We have decided that in the future we will place a ceremonial bowl of milk next to the bed on Mexican food nights for pre- and post- dips, just to be safe. Thanks everyone and happy Friday! While scrolling past the front page of reddit I saw a sub labeled by an acronym. The acronym suggested something along the lines of a mistake you made that day, it seemed like a popular sub as it was on the front page 3 times within the first 6 subs, literally every other front page post for me on this reddit was this sub. First post by a user finding something in a girls vagina by performing oral sex on her, the second post surprisingly also another story about a man finding a foreign object in a girls vagina by going down on her. The third post? This time by a \"female\" apparently having sex with her boyfriend in an airplane bathroom who occupied the facilities so long that when she stepped out a stranger rushed in an shat diarrhea all over he poor boyfriend.\\n\\n Was this indeed a sub about daily mistakes? No! I soon realized my mistake as I read more of the posts. The name of the sub was a cover for what the sub was really about...amateur erotica fiction writers weaving the most absurd situation they could come up with involving the author happen stancing into sex. It was so obvious. sex by accident, something gross or disgusting, and always being discovered right at the moment of climax. I had been fooled thinking it would br a sub about akward social situations, costly mistakes, leaving your social media open for your s.o. or sibling to find. Alas it was a creative writing sub, every post thinking of hilarious synonyms for doing the deed or genitalia, sentences ending with \"amirite?\", mother after mother bursting in on money shots and lost treasure to be found in cervixes. \\n\\nWas I the only one who noticed the sub was a front for erotic fiction? Surely other people realized what they actually came across? Then I read the comments..they knew alright. Members of the sub leaving comment after comment with puns, jokes, accolades and showering the posters with gold for their golden showers. Applauding the wildest most farfetched stories with tens of thousands of upvotes. A man tells a tale of accidentally receiving fellatio from his relative. With his ability to add the taboo of incest the upvotes soared into infinity.\\n\\nNo this sub was not for me, the stories too wild, to stomach churning, too unbelievable and unbearably desperate to please the audience. Right when I was going to click unsub though, my transgender step brother came into the room and caught me reading the sub reddit. The big bold titles proudly displaying the NSFW tag. I tried to stand up but my belt caught on the desk pulling my pants down revealing my soldier at full attention. I quickly sat back down in disbelief but he wasted no time laying his tight little backdoor right onto my erect johnson. In the excitement I didnt realize I had a hot mic connected right to the family entertainment center via blue tooth, and just when I was going to blast his boy vag into outerspace our mother burst in. He hopped off right away as soon as she opened the door but it left nothing but air standing between her and a pearl necklace. Looks like we\\'re going to have a really akward family dinner tonight :(\\n\\nTLDR; I unsubbed from an erotic fiction sub because the mods dont have a dedicated erotic story day like they used to. Set the scene. It’s 2017 I had been dating my high school crush for 3 months now, meeting up at parties, getting drunk, the usual for a 18 year old, one day we decide that its time to spend the night together in my parents’ house, because, you know, 3 months is a “serious relationship” for an 18 year old. Obviously, I had to do some prep before she came over. Fairy lights along the bed posts (cause chicks love that…) tidy the room, change the bed sheets, apply a lil bit of lavender to the pillows, spray some nice cologne gotta smell fresh.\\n\\nFast forward a few hours, it’s about 11pm, we are in bed, nothing but fairly lights lighting up the room, love is in the air, super romantic, things get heated and before we know it we are on our way to pound town, bed is rocking giving the classic bed frame squeak, having the time of our lives.\\n\\nSo this went on almost every day for a year, she would come over, we would get down to business go to sleep, repeat. And I thought nothing of it. The only thing that I questioned was when my mum came up the stairs and passed me a bag full of condoms. Me being innocent was like “hmm why would I need these, mum? I don’t have sex?” she just said, “okay they’re there if you need them” and walked out. Anyway, that didn’t rouse any suspicion.\\n\\nNow, mid-week, no one is in the house but myself and my girlfriend of a year and a bit. She sat down on the bed and it squeaked  a little bit, it had gotten worse over our year together and it made us think about how the sound might travel… Now I live in a two-story house, I stay upstairs, and my mum and stepdad sleep directly below me on the ground floor. So, I send the girlfriend downstairs into my mums’ bedroom and I jump on the bed making it squeak. she comes back upstairs with a horrified expression on her face, apparently the sound carries through the floor and is amplified by the hollow ceiling, acting like a big amplifier. So, my poor mother who has since bought an expensive pair of ear plugs has had to listen to my girlfriend and I going at it for the past year… I wasn’t able to look my mum in the eye for a few weeks after and I think she might have understood why.\\n\\nTLDR : My girlfriend and I had been screwing for a year straight in a squeaky bed and my mum could hear everything and I didn’t know\\n\\nEdit:Spelling of fairy lights was wrong\\n\\nEdit 2 : thank you for my first gold you beautiful anon So this happened a few days ago, I am a night owl and my husband is an early bird, so most of the time our intimacy moments fall in the early mornings. But because it was so early when I went to bed, I just got \"prepared\". My intention was not to wake him up, but I wanted to be ready if he chose to pursue. \\n\\nWell, it did not happen, and since I had a buzz, I drifted off to sleep. My intention was to get up and remove it before I went to sleep, but as the title says, that did not happen. I woke up roughly 4 hours after being asleep, and remembered it was back there, so I reached around back to get it out, and when I felt nothing, my eyes popped wide open! I was fully awake! I got up and searched the covers, searched around the bed in case it fell, checked again inside of me, and nothing! I panic and I\\'ll call my husband at work, and he was like \"it is a bit busy, is everything okay?\" And I am like \"No! I went to sleep with the butt plug and now I can\\'t find it anywhere!\" He was like \"what, let me call you right back\" (I am assuming because he wanted to go into the break room for privacy). As I was waiting for him to call me back, I was like well let me go sit on the toilet right quick. After a few pushes, I hear a \"clink\" and I was so relieved because I did not want to be one of those dumb ass people that had to go to the hospital because they got something stuck up their butt! When he called me back I told him what happened, everything was safe now, he busted out laughing, I told him it wasn\\'t funny because I was really stressing, he said \"if it was still in there I wouldn\\'t have been laughing\". \\n\\nLater that day, after he gets off of work, he asked me if any zucchinis have came in, in my garden, I told him no but I have some cucumbers coming in, he said and I quote \"you\\'re not going to lose them are you\"! F*** that a******! I don\\'t use food for that stuff!\\n\\nTL;DR tifu by going to sleep with a butt plug for about 4 hours. Couldn\\'t find it when I woke up, went to the bathroom and after a few pushes, heard a \"clink\" in the toilet\\n\\nEdit: I am so elated to receive my first award, the hot dog award! Thank you kind stranger! I have not clue when this FU started but I do know that I realised my error at the age of around 25, I\\'m currently 34.\\n\\nI was recently reminded of this after seeing this particular [image](https://preview.redd.it/k4wt3q2b25a31.jpg?width=640&amp;amp;crop=smart&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=27404351cf1bfa999bd9d068776855a4230687da) on another subreddit.\\n\\n\\nBackstory:\\n\\n\\nLike most children, I was bathed by my parents up until an age where they felt I was getting too old to have them help me, around 7, 8, 9 (for a guess, god knows). I remember that both parents had taught me the importance of cleaning everywhere efficiently. I used to hate it when my father washed my hair. He used to scrub it so hard that it would shake my head and I could feel each of his fingers digging into my scalp when he did it.\\n\\n\\nAfter I was old enough to wash myself, as well as the usual instructions of what to make sure I had washed, he always told me to give my head a good scrub. It\\'s only after realising my FU that I recalled my fathers instructions from all those years ago.\\n\\nI can only presume that once I had the ability and trust to clean myself, I choose to ignore my fathers advice about washing the shampoo in deep and hard with my fingers. For many years I would use shampoo and simply rub it onto my hair with the palms of my hands for an amount of time that I thought sufficient before washing it off again.\\n\\nI\\'m half white and half black and although my hair has always been fairly short, it has an tough afro texture. I could be stood in the shower for an hour with water pouring on my head and the hair would remain sticking up. I\\'m not sure whether this was a factor or not but I could never style my hair in any way. So It wouldn\\'t need combing when I got out of bed or out of the shower, it just stayed upright constantly and it still does.\\n\\n\\nFor as long as I remembered every time I went to the barbers I would notice a huge about of what I thought was dry skin falling all over the black gown. I used to be so embarrassed about this and constantly tell the barbers that I had a dry scalp condition. I even purchased special shampoo to treat dry scalp but nothing helped.\\n\\n\\nI couple of times a barber would tell me that I needed to clean my head properly. I just presumed that they didn\\'t understand a dry scalp when they saw one. Before going to the barbers I would have long showers washing my hair for ages but nothing helped, 30 mins later I would be in the barbers chair with white flasked falling all over the place.\\n\\n\\nOne time it was so bad that about five people in the barbers made comments about the amount of flakes scattered all about me during a cut. I was a little embarrassed but just told them all about my dry scalp condition. At the end of this particular cut I looked like I had been out in the snow for an hour.\\n\\n\\nSo the realisation came one day when I was around 24/25 and I was washing my ears. Other than a five second rinse around with my fingers, I never really put much thought into cleaning the inside of my ears. I don\\'t know why but on this occasion I decided to put shampoo inside my ears. I washed around for a while and after a few seconds I start to hear/feel my fingers squeaking, having washed away any oil that was there.\\n\\n\\nI suddenly thought of the phrase \\'squeaky clean\\', and it all of a sudden dawned on me. Memories of my father hurting my head with his fingers came back to me. I had never heard or felt my head squeak in this way since I was a kid.\\n\\n\\nI quickly emptied a load of shampoo on my hair and instead of using my palms I dug in my fingers (hard) and started scrubbing. After a while on a certain spot I heard/felt a squeak.\\n\\n\\nOMG! Right there and then I quickly realised that I didn\\'t have a dry scalp condition, I had just not properly cleaned my hair for all of these years. I washed the whole of my head until all of it squeaked.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve made sure to clean to the squeak each time since. On the next trip to the barbers there was not a single white flake anywhere and there hasn\\'t been one since.\\n\\n\\nI told the barber the doctor had given me some medication which has fixed my problem so that I didn\\'t have to confess to being a dirty, dumb idiot. I will make sure my son never has to go though this by telling him my story.\\n\\n\\nTL/DR\\n\\nFor ten years I thought that I was covering the barbers gowns in white flakes because I had a dry scalp problem. It turned out that I just didn\\'t know how to wash my hair properly.\\n\\nEdit: Grammar\\n\\nMany thanks for the gold :-) Happened this morning. I\\'m not a fan of grocery shopping, it\\'s always crowded and chaotic. Usually I go together with my boyfriend so we can get it over with twice as fast.\\n\\nNow, with the corona virus, they only allow an X amount of people in the store at the same time and they urge you to do your shopping alone and keep 1.5m distance. I decided I\\'d go by myself this morning, while my boyfriend is off to work (he has an essential job and still has to go every day). \\n\\nLuckily it wasn\\'t too crowded this morning and I could get inside without waiting. Nevertheless, I wanted to go in and out as quickly as possible. Our supermarket has those hand scanners with which you can scan the products yourself, then after scanning you just have to pay and get out. I really like this because it\\'s a lot faster than waiting in line for the cashier.\\n\\nInside the supermarket I was getting a little stressed as some people were not keeping their distance as they should be, so I started rushing even more. They had a pretty good sale on wine with 50% off, so I decided to take 2 boxes with me, 6 bottles each. I quickly loaded them onto my cart, grabbed the remaining items I needed and quickly went to the pay desk. Since I had some beer and wine, a lady came over to check my age and after that I could pay and go.\\n\\nOnce at home I checked the receipt to see if the discount from the wine was calculated correctly, but then I noticed the wine wasn\\'t on the receipt at all! I must have totally forgot to scan it, so I just stole 12 bottles from the supermarket!\\n\\nI just went to the supermarket again to tell them about my mistake. Both because it didn\\'t feel right and because I didn\\'t want them to find out and put me on a blacklist or something as I go there regularly. The cashier had to laugh at my story and could understand my mistake, she was very happy I came by again to pay anyway.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR Due to the Corona virus I rushed my grocery shopping and forgot to scan 2 boxes of wine, thus ended up leaving without paying for them. Went by the supermarket again to pay this afternoon. I live alone and like to set up my place as \\'smart\\' as possible. So I have smart lights, speakers, smart locks and some other stuff set up. I set up a few \\'joke\\' routines on Google Assistant that I would show my friends for a laugh.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy whole family came over on the weekend and I was showing my 5 year old nephew how to use Google Home to change the color of the lights. Which he thought was the greatest thing in the world.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo cue the whole family coming to my bedroom to see the little guy having the time of his life. He says \\'Hey Google!\\' followed by what sounded like a bit of gibberish. But Google Assistant thought he said \\'wank mode\\'. Which just so happens to be one of the \\'joke\\' routines I set up.. It gets triggered by saying either \\'wank mode\\' or \\'jerky jerky time\\'.\\n\\nIt basically goes like this.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nGoogle Assistant says \\'Engaging wank mode, my Lord\\'\\n\\nFront door locks\\n\\nBedroom light turns to 100% brightness and turns red\\n\\nBedroom speaker plays  Led Zeppelin - Immigrant Song\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThe awkward silence during those moments is something I will never forget.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR Whole family believe they saw my ideal jerky jerky conditions thanks to Google Assistant.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT: Thank you for the silver and gold. For those asking how to set routines up with Google Assistant, it\\'s pretty simple using the Home app. Just Google \\'Google Assistant routines\\' and it will show you the steps. im keeping names besides mine out of this for privacy. i step outside to smoke a cigarette on my front porch roughly 2 hours ago and as im trying to get my lighter to work i hear crying first off my front porch to my house is enclosed by white gate wall with little holes same for the door so nobody can even see through from the outside, however i can see through from the inside ( it\\'s nice to be able to catch scumbags trying to break into my car in the middle of the night because of this) anyway, i look for the crying it didnt sound like a child it sounded like a full grown woman. i quickly find out who is crying directly across the street from my house to the right 1 house i see my neighbor\\'s significant other on her knees crying like she was. A. beaten up, or B. devastated from something such as a breakup. i heard yelling and stuff breaking last night. i assumed the latter. so i wanted to check if she was at the very least unharmed. i usually keep my nose out of peoples business but the inner captain save a hoe in me kicked in for some reason TBH i try to look out for my neighbors regardless my reasoning behind it is because you live next to them so you may as well be social once or twice just to know if things are going to be chill.\\n\\ni walk across the street and introduce myself i have not spoken to these people before because they are never home until almost midnight and they leave around 6 a.m. damn near everyday they were very quiet and not nosy in anyway so i never attempted to talk to them when a opportunity to do so in the past arose. i say \"hi im taylor, i apologize for the intrusion i just want to make sure you aren\\'t harmed.\" clearly very upset she hardly could speak clearly and started to try to say \"he doesn\\'t want to be with me anymore\" im relieved to know she is fine physically so im ready to say \"best of luck\" and head home. not even 5 seconds pass and the front door opens swiftly and its the neighbor he starts yelling is this the motherfucker you\\'re seeing?.. how did he come to that conclusion? ( if i recognized his face sort of why cant he? ) i try to immediately say \"im your neighbor i was just trying to make sure she was unharmed.\" then the woman FUCKS ME OVER dragging me into the drama further she yells \" yeah, this is taylor and hes way better than you in everyway!\" my face turns red out of anger my eyes wide open and mouth agape, why the fuck would you say that? the dude likely interpreted that as why did you just tell him the truth im sure thats how he interpreted it because just as i finish saying WTF to this woman I GET PUNCHED SO FUCKING HARD, i should have seen it coming he was visibly very angry. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n( now I\\'ve done time in prison so i am no stranger to fighting the only reason i mention this is because i want to shed a little perspective on my lifestyle and the reasoning behind my following decision to take matters into my own hands. i do not call cops, i do not ever run from a fight. i never ever ever stick my nose into other peoples business and i broke that rule over a woman crying.)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\ni am on someone elses property i get hit. well i have cameras outside my house and i know that his house is within full view so i could have just called the cops and been done with it but no this is something i considered not one bit. i unloaded on this guy he was the same size and build however i was probably in better shape than him aside from my lungs. this woman that made things worse is now full blown hysterical she wailing and crying louder and harder than before and i just beat up my neighbor he beat me up too but this wasn\\'t my first rodeo and this guy was a suit and tie. soft hands no calluses he absolutely made good choices in life and is more successful than me financially but he made a huge mistake as well as i. the noise from this other woman drew the attention of other neighbors now i know most of the immediate surrounding ones except 2 and guess which neighbors came to investigate?take a wild fucking guess? the neighbors i dont know and they are on the phone. (FUCK..........MY...........LIFE) i decided ill go home and pull up the recording so if the police show up i have some sort of defense. i have a record and things look bad im expecting to go to jail for trespassing, assault you name it.\\n\\n10 minutes later a patrol car arrived and a cop bangs on my door i have the recording on my phone so all i have to do is hand the phone to our officer and let fate decide. i gave my statement in cuffs and im in the back of the car for almost 45 minutes im thinking this is it im screwed. then the magic happened a second patrols car shows up and both officers start talking and watch the video i asked them to look at i know the first officer already saw the video almost right away so im thinking yes they believe me and dude is gonna get his. sure enough they place him in the car and the officer comes over opens the door for me and says step out  unlocks the cuffs and said im not under arrest and that my video saved my ass then they cuff the woman and throw er in the car i was in i asked why she was getting arrested she wasnt in the fight directly. and then i heard the scummiest most absolute piece of garbage thing ever. they both, the couple, tried to say i attacked the dude threatened the woman and i was trying to threaten them from calling the police WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK. an hour ago they were against each other to the point where the woman was getting kicked out of the house. and they actually tried to get me thrown in jail. now the officer said that it looked like what they were saying was true or close to the truth when they watched the video but the audio is what made sure i was innocent they where able to hear part of  the conversation because of their yelling. NEVER AGAIN, NEVER WILL I ENTER DRAMA AND IF MY NEIGHBOR IS SEEN AGAIN I WILL ENJOY SCARING HIM WITH INTIMIDATING LOOKS.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR - I saw a female neighbor that i didnt know at all crying. went to see if things were fine and it turned into getting puched, almost arrested with accusations of assault and threats Obligatory:  This happened a few years ago.  My delightful wife only reminded me of this yesterday by forwarding the photos.  No, not those sort of photos you filthy minded swine!  It did, however, require copious amounts of eye bleach.\\n\\n\\nSetting the scene, I (36M at the time) and my older sibling (41F) were working through our recently-deceased mother\\'s (74F) possessions in order to clear her house.  We stumbled upon her Kindle during our room cleanups, and my sister came out with the fatal line:\\n\\n\\n \"Awww, she used to love reading.  I know she\\'s bought tonnes of books from Amazon over the years.  I wonder what she\\'s read recently?\"\\n\\n \\nBlithely, I opened up my mother\\'s Kindle library and, well...  \\n\\nhttps://i.imgur.com/Oum9A9E.jpg\\n\\n\\nhttps://i.imgur.com/1yHvKbe.jpg\\n\\nFor those who can\\'t be bothered to open the photos, they are a small sample of the titles she had purchased.  I snapped these photos in a moment of insanity but felt the need to keep some sort of evidence.\\n\\n\"Diapered for Pay\" and \"Breeding my Sleeping Wife\" are particular gems, however \"Hot Cooking Spanker\" takes on a new dimension when you consider her former occupation as a chef.\\n\\nSuffice to say, the expression on my face made my sister grab it out of my hands.  Turning bright red, she muttered \"I knew I shouldn\\'t have introduced her to 50 Shades\".\\n\\nTLDR:  Found deceased mother\\'s Kindle.  Discovered her late-life sexual awakening.  Not enough mental and eye bleach in the world sufficient.\\n\\nEdited to add a couple of points:  Thank you for the awards, and thank you also for those pointing out the This American Life piece on https://www.thisamericanlife.org/689/digging-up-the-bones/act-two-4.  I\\'m thinking of tracking this guy down and starting a support group.\\n\\nThat is not me - today is the first day I\\'ve heard of that site, in fact.  I\\'ll grant our stories are similar, although this was direct on my mother\\'s Kindle and not via a shared account.  I am also British like the chap in the story, which is why this evokes a level of cringe beyond what you might normally expect.  We - and certainly folk of that generation - do not discuss sex, as a rule.\\n\\nLastly, I fully appreciate that yes, my mother had sex like any other person.  It\\'s more the somewhat unusual choice of... \"content consumption\" at her advanced age which was slightly eyebrow raising.  Still, if it got her pulse racing, good for her. This happen to me about an hour ago. My car broke down and had to call Uber for a ride across town to work (which is about 40 minutes away). I work for a pretty big company and when he saw the address the conversation started. *(For my privacy and the privacy of others, I\\'m going to change the name of my job and the people I\\'m speaking of.)*\\n\\nUD: \"Hey man, you work *JOB*? How do you like it?\"\\n\\nMe: \"It is pretty good. Pay is great, people are nice...can\\'t really complain.\"\\n\\nUD: \"Bruh that is really good man. Gotta work hard these days, don\\'t know if you\\'ll have another chance, you know?\"\\n\\nMe: \"Yeah man. I get you.\"\\n\\nUD: \"I actually got a friend that works up there. He use to make websites all the time and he was excited when you guys hired him.\"\\n\\nMe: \"I\\'m glad to hear that. What is his name?\"\\n\\nUD: \"My boy Frank.\"\\n\\nMe: \"Frank...Gallagher?\"\\n\\nUD: \"Hell yeah, he is super smart and had a streak of bad luck with jobs. Then he got hired there and we knew he was set.\"\\n\\nMe: \"Um..When was the last time you talked to him?\"\\n\\nUD: \"Its been about 2-ish years. Me and my girl had a kid and lost contact with a few people but now that you reminded me of him, I\\'m going to hit him up soon.\"\\n\\nMe: \"I don\\'t know if that is possible, Frank died like 2 years ago.\"\\n\\nUD: \".....What? Nah man. We must be talking about two different people.\"\\n\\nMe: \"I\\'ve been working there for a while and we have had only one Frank Gallagher to work for us. He died in the summer of 2014 I believe.\"\\n\\nUD: \"No, he didn\\'t. I\\'m going to call him right now because I\\'m pretty sure we are talking about two different people bruh.\"\\n\\n**calls Frank on his phone and the number is disconnected**\\n\\nUD: \"He probably didn\\'t pay his bill. You know how us black people are with our bills and shit. Hahaha\"\\n\\nMe: \"Ummm...I trained him when he was hired. I\\'m sorry you found out this way but he was the only one.\"\\n\\nUD: \"He wasn\\'t some young dude. He is about my age, like 40...\"\\n\\nMe: \"or early 50\\'s? Black, slender, short with salt and pepper hair. Chipped tooth? Yeah, Frank. I know him because I really like him. Worked harder than any other young guy I\\'ve ever trained. He died, man. I\\'m really sorry you found out like this.\"\\n\\n**Uber Driver starts to cry and pulls over**\\n\\nUD: \"I....what...we were around the same age. What the fuck?!\"\\n\\nMe: \"I\\'m sorry...I don\\'t know what to say\" *looks at the clock on my phone*\\n\\nUD: \"He is way to young to die man. We are both in our 40\\'s bruh.*\\n\\nHe eventually collected himself and kept driving. Still got to work on time. I took a picture of Frank that I had on my desk and sent it to him, so he could realize we are talking about the same person.\\n\\n**TL;DR** I, a stranger, informed a friendly Uber driver that one of his friends died and we shared a very emotional car ride together. \\n \\n**Edit** name and grammar\\n\\n**UPDATE** This has really blown up. I didn\\'t expect this post to have so many responses or all the weirdly negative inbox messages I received that say \"Kill Yourself asshole\" or \"Scum for doing that to a person\". [I screenshot\\'d the text message between the Uber Driver and I.](http://imgur.com/gallery/ErXBP) Wasn\\'t mean or anything, he just wanted me to be certain about \"Frank\".  Obligatory throwaway account and this happened last weekend, but I\\'m only discovering the total impact today.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMy sister\\'s wedding was last weekend. During a hurricane/tropical storm thing. I haven\\'t lived in my hometown for several years, so hurricane/tropical storm survival skills are a little rusty.\\n\\nMy best friend drove, as I had flown in for the event and didn\\'t rent a car. As we are about to leave, I remember that my lipstick is in the house, and in case they want to do pictures at the reception or after the ceremony, I need to be prepared. I run back in the house, grab my lipstick, run back down the driveway, and open the door to my friend\\'s car.\\n\\nIn the .3 seconds that I stopped to open the door, my legs suddenly felt like they were ON FIRE. So when the door opens, I\\'m screaming \"I\\'m on fire!!!\" and my best friend looks totally befuddled as there is no evidence of anything burning. 3 seconds later, I realize I have been swarmed by fire ants.\\n\\nFire ants. In my shoes. In my clothes. In my hair. In the car. Hundreds of them. My best friend and I are frantically trying to get these ants off of me and out of the car. I run back in the house, and rinse my feet off in the bathtub. My feet are starting to swell. Throw on a pair of slip on casual shoes because my now-swelling feet won\\'t fit in the shoes I brought to wear to the wedding. Get to the wedding, 10 minutes late, with whelps erupting all over my feet, legs and fingers. Found an ant crawling on my arm in the church.\\n\\nNow, you know how when you\\'ve been itching all over you start to itch in places that shouldn\\'t be itching? Like a phantom itch? Ok, so, I had an itch in my crotch during the wedding and reception. Yeast infection? No. Probably just a phantom itch because my entire body is itching from the 45 or so bites. Or so I thought...\\n\\nA couple days later, I return home and me and the hubs have sexy time. He says \"you ok? things felt kind of... hard?\" I made some joke about getting old... well...\\n\\nDuring my shower, I also realize things are.... hard. I intrepidly take a very graphic selfie to investigate.\\n\\nFire ant bites. On my inner labia.\\n\\nThere is no WebMD entry for how to treat fire ant bites on genitalia.\\n\\nTLDR: Went to sister\\'s wedding, came home a firecrotch. Fire ants swarm during heavy rain, kiddos.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT : RIP my inbox. Some items to clarify:\\n\\n1. Bites are healing. Even THOSE bites.\\n2. Regarding attending a wedding in a pandemic - all of the venues limited the number of guests to under 50, even outdoors. The church holds 1100 people-- so all of us basically had a pew to ourselves during the ceremony. The reception venue holds 200 - only 40 or so people attended. Half of the attendees stayed in one section of the venue watching football on a big screen TV. Again, limited contact. And masks and sanitizer were available throughout the venues for people that didn\\'t bring their own.\\n3. Yeah, I know, weddings are the new super spreader events and the decision to attend was not made lightly. I did spend all day Saturday before the wedding with my dad, helping him get ready, watching football, and going through his old high school yearbooks reminiscing about his friends and his memories. His wish was to have all of us together for a happy event one last time, COVID be damned. He gets tested approximately once a month as well. So far, he\\'s still negative.\\n4. Fire ants form \"ant rafts\" in water as they try to escape their flooded mounds during heavy rain. Car was in the driveway. Ants had aggregated in a puddle next to the car, and that is what I stepped in.\\n5. Yes, I know \"whelps\" are puppies. However, my very southern dad has called \"welts\" \"whelps\" my whole life-- force of habit. I\\'m keeping it.  Obligatory this happened 7 years ago, as my son is now 9, and this decision has now come back to haunt us.\\n\\nBackground filler:\\n\\n\\n(I graduated law school in December 2007 and passed the bar exam in February 2008.  I kept my BarBri materials as I was going to trade with a friend who took the bar in a state I was debating taking it in, but that never worked out, so they remained in the office.)\\n\\nThe Story:\\n\\n\\nOur son was born in 2009 and this happened in 2011-12.  He was not any easy child to get to go to bed and we would often read to him for hours.  One night I had enough and decided to find the most boring thing I could, so I pulled out my Barbri Book on Contracts and started reading it.  He was fascinated and demanded I read more and more.  He\\'d ask questions, like any good Dad I answered.  So I was teaching my 2.5-3 year old contract law, and eventually more advanced contract law.  \\n\\nFast forward to Kindergarten.  He got upset with his teacher one day because she entered into a verbal contract to give them an extra recess if they did X and Y.  Well they did, but it rained, so she couldn\\'t give them the time.  This did not sit well, as our son proceeded to lecture her on the elements of a verbal contract and how one was created and she breached it.  She had no answer for him, and we had a talk about it with her.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this behavior didn\\'t stop.  He would negotiate with adults for things he wanted, and if he felt he performed his side of the contract, he would get angry if they breached.  He will explain to them what the offer was, how he accepted it, and what was the consideration.  And if they were the ones who made the offer, he would point out any ambiguity was in his favor.   When they tried pointing out kids can\\'t enter contracts, he counters with if an adult offers the contract, they must perform their part if the child did their part and they cannot use them being a child to withhold performance.  \\n\\nThis eventually progressed to him negotiating contracts and deals with his classmates in second grade**.  Only now he knew to put things in writing, and would get his friends to sign promissory notes.  He started doing this when they started doing word problems in math. He knew these weren\\'t enforceable, but would point out his friends did not know this.   We eventually got him to stop this by understanding he couldn\\'t be mad because he knows they can\\'t form a contract.  \\n\\nIt culminated in Third Grade when he negotiated with his teacher to have an extra recess.  This time, he remembered to have her agree that she would honor it later if it rained (which it did).  So then she said she wouldn\\'t, and he lost it and had to see the principal.   Who agreed with him and talked to the teacher.\\n\\nNow that this happened, we had to also see the Principal to discuss this.  She is astounded how good he is at this, but acknowledges we need to put a stop to it*.  So it is now put in his Education plan that adults cannot engage in negotiation with him as he is adept at contract formation and tricking adults into entering verbal contracts.  \\n\\nTLDR: I taught my 2-3 year old contract law out of desperation to get him to go to bed.  When he got to school he used these skills to play adults. \\n\\nEdit: *When I say put a stop to it I mean the outbursts when adults don\\'t meet their obligations in his eyes. The principal encourages him to talk out solutions and to find compromise. \\n\\nEdit 2: **Clarified the time line and added context.  This happened today during dinner time. And I still have all that adrenaline in me so I decided to share it here to help myself calm down.\\n\\nSome background context before the fucked up. Me (25yrs), my wife (24yrs) and my son (6mths) are staying with my parents. My son has recently started on solid foods(puréed) and he enjoys it. Also, his motor skills has been developing much faster than most babies his age. So, many time we just let him be, thinking he\\'ll be fine.\\n\\nMoving on to the fuck up. During dinners my son would usually join us in his high chair eating his baby bites (biscuit for baby). It was the same tonight just that he was asking for more this time. So we decided giving him apples might be a good idea since he likes the puréed version. My mom then proceeds to cut a slice of apple (normal adult sized slice). We then feed him the apple, letting him suck on it. Then my wife asked my mom to cut smaller so that he can eat it. My mom replied saying that she\\'s worried that if it\\'s too small he might end up breaking it with his gum and choke himself. But in the end we somehow got my mom to cut it into smaller bite size.\\n\\nSo, we just continued our dinner while talking about what to do if a baby does get choke, heimlich maneuver, CPR... Basically topic around those area. Then we hear a tiny apple crunch. He was still happily eating, so we continue chatting and eating. But shortly after my wife shouted for me saying he\\'s really choking. I turned and saw my son\\'s face turing red-purple-ish, no sound was coming out of him. I instantly shot up from my chair removed him from his high chair and tried to perform the heimlich maneuver for babies, basically mimicking from a vague memory of what I saw on YouTube years ago. And then he cough and started crying. This was the first time that I\\'m glad to hear my son\\'s cry. \\n\\nNow I\\'m having a slight headache from all that adrenaline rush. But I\\'m glad my son is alive and kicking. Thanks to that random YouTube video I watch years ago.\\n\\nEdit 1: my wife saw this post and she corrected 1 of my mistake. It was actually my sister who suggested to cut the apple into smaller slices. We just didn\\'t disagree with the idea.\\n\\nEdit 2: OMG... This really blew up I posted this before going to work (I work night shift), it was only about 100+ up votes before I left for work and I could still keep up with all the comments. While I was at work, I kept receiving notifications... Then I saw 2k up votes... And now 20k... I never thought my first post on r/TIFU would get 20k up votes and thousand over comments and all those awards. Really want to thank everyone for your concern. My son is fine, actively crawling around\\n\\nEdit 3: I saw some comments about CPR certification. I served the military for 2 years. So I was trained to do CPR. But on adults. Not babies. I only knew about it cos I spend way too much time on YouTube.\\n\\nEdit 4: just saw many comments about led weaning. We are doing this. Usually we would mesh bananas, sweet potatoes, saute apples, It\\'s just this one time that we decided it\\'s fine to let him suck on the apple and some how ending up letting him eat it... Horrible mistake which we will never forget.\\n\\nEdit 5: I realized I might have used the term \"heimlich maneuver\" wrongly what should I call it tho? Heimlich for babies maneuver?... What I did was holding my son face down at about, legs slightly higher up and I slap/thrust/pat(?) I think it was more like a pat/slap. I was panicking and everything I did was base on my vague memory of a video from youtube... In the moment I was more like do whatever possible to save my son.\\n\\nTL;DR we fed my 6 months old son some apple causing him to choke. I performed the heimlich maneuver for babies base on a vague memory of a YouTube video to save him. This actually happened today, typing this up on my lunch break while the kiddos are napping.\\n\\nBackground: I am a male teacher that works at a preschool attached to a church. I am not religious.\\n\\nThis morning, I saw one of my male students hit a girl. I pulled him aside and explained to him why he shouldn\\'t hit anyone, but especially not girls because he\\'s a boy. \\n\\nHe asked, \"Why especially not girls? Does that mean I can hit boys and not get in trouble?\"\\n\\nBeing that we are attached to a church, and because I honestly didn\\'t have a better answer on hand, I thought it would be safe to reply: \"No, you need to always keep your hands to yourself but God made boys stronger than girls so we can protect them, not hurt them.\" \\n\\nGoddammit, I was wrong. Big mistake.\\n\\nThe little boy seemed to have an \"a-ha!\" moment in his head, as the idea clicked in his mind. \"OK, I won\\'t hit girls. I will be strong and protect them.\" he says. After a few more minutes of time out, and apparently mulling over the mildly misogynistic thought I just inadvertently planted in his head, I allowed him to go back and play.\\n\\nImmediately, I knew I had fucked up.\\n\\n\"DID YOU KNOW THAT BOYS ARE STRONGER THAN GIRLS?!\" \\n\\nHe\\'s running around the room telling everyone with ears that boys are stronger than girls, quickly earning the ire of the girls in the class. \\n\\nNow, mind you, this is a stage of development where most of the girls in the class are actually bigger than the boys. The tallest of which immediately claps back at him, \"Nuh-uh! I\\'m bigger than all the boys in here, and I\\'m stronger too!\" \\n\\nHe says \"It doesn\\'t matter! Mr. Soprano just told me that God made boys stronger than girls so we can protect them. Right, Mr. Soprano?\"\\n\\nI literally facepalmed. I weakly tried to walk it back, saying, \"Well some girls ARE stronger than boys but we should really just all keep our hands--OH MY GOD!\" I was interrupted by the girl screaming \"ATTTAAAAACK!!!\" as she punched the boy square in the stomach, and all of the girls stanced up to fight all of the boys 1v1. It was madness! I could see seething hatred oozing from the eyes of the girls, they were bloodthirsty after their strength was questioned. One girl started pretending to use force lightning on a boy. \\n\\nI got them to settle down, and had talks with all of them about keeping our hands to ourselves and not hitting ANYONE regardless of gender. I still heard bickering under their breath of which sex was the strongest, but I at least ended the violence. Crisis averted.\\n\\nAnyhow, that\\'s how (TL;DR) I mistakenly created a mini-misogynist and caused a feminist uprising in my preschool class by telling a boy that boys shouldn\\'t hit girls because \"God made boys stronger\". Oof. Let\\'s hope they forget it all happened completely after nap time. So this just happened a while ago. I live in a high rise building (19th floor) and recently ordered a pair of binoculars as I am going on a trip with some friends and thought it would be nice to have them just in case. Well the binoculars got delivered today and I decided to try them out. I was on my balcony looking at some other high rise buildings nearby when I ACCIDENTALLY looked inside an apartment at the building right across me (around 150-200ft away) and saw a naked middle aged woman who I think just got out of the shower (no idea why her blinds were open). Unfortunately, she saw me looking at her with the binoculars and ran into another room. I panicked as well and ran inside and closed my blinds. And now I’m just sitting here and hoping no one knocks on my door. I don’t even know how I will explain myself and if anyone will believe me.\\n\\nTL;DR got caught looking at my naked neighbour with binoculars and now I’m shitting myself.\\n\\nUpdate: So I left my apartment the day it happened for several hours and came back pretty late. There was a knock on my door yesterday and I obviously freaked out and was expecting to get yelled at but luckily it was just an Amazon driver delivering a package. It’s been over two days now and nothing has happened so I think I’m good. This happened today. About 20 minutes ago, to be more precise.\\n\\nI just started a new job about a month ago. It\\'s a quiet office environment. I only really know the people immediately around me, but everyone\\'s been super nice to me so far.\\n\\nOne of the things I love about this place is they have a bunch of free breakfast stuff in the break room. This morning I thought a bagel sounded nice so I went to go toast one up. This is where the FU begins. \\n\\nI separated the bagel into two halves and went to put it in the toaster. I\\'ve only ever owned peasant toasters, but this stainless-steel bad boy had all the bells and whistles, including a \"bagel\" setting. I figured it wouldn\\'t hurt so I punched it and waited. \\n\\nWhile I stood there my mind began to drift. I started thinking about Lord of the Rings for some reason, specifically trying to figure out when my kids would be old enough for me to introduce them to it. I heard the door to the break room shut and assumed the only person who had been in there with me had just left.\\n\\nThen the toaster dinged and my bagel popped up. I took it out and was struck by how amazingly it had toasted. Warm and soft on the outside, toasted perfection on the inside. I started spreading the butter, still admiring the flawless bagel in my hands. My brain was still in fantasy mode though, and I said to myself in full-on Smeagol voice, \"Oooh yes! We likes it! Gives it to us golden and crispy!\"\\n\\nAt this point, my rational brain kicked back in and I realized how fucking weird I can be sometimes. Oh well, no big deal. I take my bagel and turn around, nearly running into a group of ladies looking at me like I just arrived from another planet. I tried to give a polite smile, but I\\'m sure the surprise and wave of awkwardness I was experiencing made that creepy too. I shuffled past them and am now hiding at my desk. I\\'m sure it\\'s just a matter of time before \"the new guy\" is rebranded as \"the multiple personality weirdo who talks to himself.\" Shit.\\n\\nTL;DR Talked like Smeagol while buttering my bagel and was overhead by my new coworkers. Instant shame. So obligatory this happened yesterday but I’m still traumatised as I’ve never really encountered confrontation on such a big scale.\\n\\nSo let me set the scene first. I live (and grew up) in a fairly densely populated city in Europe that has a good amount of nature patches. The people are genuinely quite friendly and usually not too short-tempered unless strangers (a.k.a non-locals) are involved. The location of this FU was a pretty busy junction just down the road of my flat - think two car lanes, cycling lanes, and pedestrian crossing. Anyway, it was just before rush hour, around 4 pm and the sun was grilling everyone in Europe (climate change - yeiy) for the past 3 weeks.\\n\\nI was strolling down the road towards the junction completely blanking my surrounding as I was trying to come up with the perfect dish to surprise my gf in the evening. Picture that quiet guy just minding his own business, head down, focusing on every single step - yep that’s me. Suddenly, I bump my head into a rock - or so I initially thought. I look up. It was the largest man I’ve ever seen - about the size of the mountain from GOT. He looked like a bodybuilder on steroids with a side of extra muscle (let’s call him ARNIE). I was startled for a second before I see his buddy (let’s call him SLY) who was quite a bit shorter but just as wide as he was tall - so still quite intimidating for an under-the-radar-guy like me. “Oi, watch where you are going” I bellow (jk, obviously Arnie did). So being super alpha and dominant I mumble “Sorry” and move around them to continue my walk to the supermarket. “I mean how the f\\\\*\\\\*\\\\* was I meant to walk past them when they literally block the whole pavement standing next to each other.” I think and kick a chestnut out of frustration - metaphorically releasing and passing on all my problems. And oh boy that worked - somewhat. What happened next I could not have imagined in a thousand lifetimes. Hey, I mean even with the current AI technology I doubt they would have been able to predict that outcome.\\n\\nI see the chestnut flying Roberto Carlos style towards the junction (hell, I heard the crowd roaring) and IMO it probably even broke the sound barrier. While the chestnut was still in flight I raise my hand in pride having reclaimed my manliness with this superb treasure of a shot. And I’m talking the eager-please-pick-me-keen-bean-Susan from middle-school hand raise (no, Susan mayonnaise is not an instrument).\\n\\nSuddenly everything kept coming down.\\n\\nThe chestnut flew past a motorcyclist (around 3 feet high) who must have registered some kind of movement in front of him and he immediately hit the break. Remember how I said they had nature patches in the city? Well, the city installed sprinklers to keep the grass hydrated and green, but they somehow have their own spirit and love releasing water into the most inconvenient directions.\\n\\nYou guessed it, despite almost 40°C there was a puddle the size of a small American town right there in front of the breaking motorcyclist. His breaking turns into sliding, into rotating, into falling and finally into that metal-to-asphalt-screeching halting. Behind him, a red car doesn’t manage to break in time but does a Fast and the Furious drift and slides past the motorcycle also coming to a halt in the middle of the crossing around 5 meters away from the motorcyclist. Then my attention is caught by the opposing lane as the red car just cut off a blue car’s path who does the same drift (thanks to the puddle) and ends up head-on with the bumper wrapped around the traffic light post. By a miracle of God (or chance for the atheists) the post was harder than a dick after a two-week dry period and withstood the incident without giving in. Yet the ten or so pedestrians waiting behind it scattered away with two stumbling over each other and falling flat faced. What followed after this was the loudest concert of honking cars and screaming, followed by screeching breaks from all directions.\\n\\nAnd then a split second of silence.\\n\\nUntil I hear a majestic roaring that Simba would be proud of: “DUUUUUUUDE, WHAT THE FUCK!!!”, yup Arnie and Sly walk up behind me and instantly get the attention of about another ten surrounding pedestrians that just at that moment exited the supermarket next to me. They start to explain what they saw to the others (\\'me causing this accident on purpose and celebrating\\') and suddenly an elderly man (let’s call him Miyagi) grabbed my wrist with the iron grip of a Cyberman.\\n\\nAt that moment my life flashed in front of my eyes. My future, my spotless criminal record, my clumsy soap handling skills and my virgin butt hole. I was not going to make it a single night in prison.\\n\\nSuddenly the commotion starts - picture a Real Madrid vs Barcelona team vs. team fight - all traffic stops, everyone gets out of their cars and comes towards our little ensemble - shouting. I’ve never seen a crowd agree that fast on anything but within 30 seconds everyone was pointing at me with red faces, anger in their eyes and most of them looked like they were going to release their Super Saiyan form on me while I was still trying to flee Miyagi’s claws (I know, statistically not all of them could have been Super Saiyans but still). What I haven’t mentioned yet is that I actually look fairly mixed-race and live in a very white neighbourhood - so within another 30 seconds many of the screams were more racist than incident related (immigration and progressive Europe - yeiy). Throughout I just kept silent and head down as about thirty people by now were surrounding me (still triangled by Arnie, Sly, and Miyagi) so that my voice would have drowned anyway.\\n\\nAfter about another 5 minutes which felt like an eternity the golden opportunity arrived. I think Sly took some pity with me and signaled a countdown with his left hand so only I could see and pointed into his direction. I am no fighter but I took one class of Wing Chun back in high school and in a spark of genius it all came back to me that moment. ’trap the dragon’s head, the tail bites - trap the tail, the head bites’. As Sly got down to his last finger I do the Kung Fu twist with my arm, break Miyagi\\'s iron grip around my wrist and start dashing towards Sly. For a split second I thought I’d run into a muscle wall for the second time this day but in the last moment, he moved his 300 lbs. out of a way with the swiftness of a ballerina (damn, I was impressed). And then the sprint of a lifetime started. I was Powell, Bolt, and Blake at the same time. I ran like my butthole depended on it (well it kinda did). Luckily the mob never bothered to stand behind Arnie and Sly cause they figured I’d never get past them, so I didn’t actually have to tackle anyone on my escape (no potential assault charges - yeiy) and continued down the road. I see some people follow me (pretty sure they had no clue about the chestnut but they just thought I was somehow involved) so I kept running and I had a good 100 m head start. I was just in front of my apartment block when I had the second spark of genius of the day - there was no way I would show them where I lived, so I ran for another 10 min further than any man has run ever before (about 2 km) until I reached a park to lie down. I was pretty sure that I lost most people when I passed my flat (thank god for the heat) but I had to be sure.\\n\\nI cool down and call my neighbour who’s flat looks down on the junction. I told her the whole story (she’s a super old family friend) and she couldn’t believe I was the guy sprinting away (she was sunning on her terrace). Turns out the motorcyclist got up without injury and the blue and red car drivers weren’t harmed either. According to my neighbour the cops and ambulance were called and they took down the details of all drivers, moved the blue car and treated the two pedestrians for about an hour, while all traffic was stopped.\\n\\nSomething I didn’t realise from my POV was that a second mob formed simultaneously around the motorcyclist after the crash who blamed him for everything, cause it looked like he just couldn’t drive… and guess what - he was a foreigner - so that box was checked. His insurance will probably cover everything (at least that\\'s what my conscience tells me).\\n\\nI haven’t left my flat of fear being recognised at the supermarket, my gf was a bit pissed that I made frozen pizza, and I promised myself to never kick a chestnut again.\\n\\ntl:dr kicked a chestnut, distracted a motorcyclist, got out of hand and caused a crash, got blamed by a lot of clueless people, escaped running\\n\\nEDIT: Submitted this around midnight and went to bed to wake up to a blowing up inbox. Thanks guys. Also thank you so much for the gold. I put somewhere in the comments that excessive humour is my coping mechanism to deal with things. I apologise if that style really wasn\\'t your jam and will work on semantics for the future. If you did enjoy it, you\\'re welcome - we probably could make great friends in RL. And yes English is not my mother tongue, and I lived all around so that\\'s why my units of space and mass are very all over the place.  This happened Saturday night. My wife and I both frequent a relatively cheap \"Asian massage\" place that has a typical variety of reflexology, massages, etc. We\\'ve probably been to this place 50-60 times in 5 years. Every time is essentially exactly the same. We get our massage, pay $40 and tip after. My wife usually would to tip $10 each but over the years we\\'ve increased this to $20 because I feel like the people working there are obviously immigrants from China and probably living at that place and not making all that much money. \\n\\nAnyway, this Saturday evening I went solo as my wife was out of town and everything was the same except for the fact that out of the blue the massage girl started massaging my ass rather intrusively. Like, way too deep into the crack area and I\\'m on my stomach, don\\'t speak Chinese, and her English is basically zero so um okay. I\\'m not a prude or anything but I\\'m also not a guy who has ever gotten happy endings so I\\'m like okay this is uncomfortable because my anus is being greased up and this is kinda weird no matter how you look at it but she\\'s not jerking me off so I just wait out the probably 20-30 seconds of unwanted fondling. But then she returned to the region again with like knuckles first and I start to like clench my butt cheeks and seriously consider whether I\\'m going to get a finger (or worse) massaging my innards. \\n\\nFondling stopped and she asked me to flip on to my back, which I did. At this point I notice that she\\'s wearing this super skimpy bright red dress like she\\'s at a night club. Bear in mind that up until this point I hadn\\'t seen her. That\\'s when I am thinking okay wait have I ever been here on a Saturday night before and did I just discover that our favourite cheap massage joint transforms into a shady rub and tug on Saturday nights?Uh oops?\\n\\nAfter the usual head and neck massage she goes to my legs and starts to literally like rub her hands all the way into my crotch and make contact with my balls and naturally I pop a boner. But I\\'m like fuck this and said \"no don\\'t touch there\" and she replies in some kind of awkward sexy voice like \"oh baby don\\'t worry I no touch big boy.\" Ah yeah aaaaawkward. But she then retreated her hands to my feet and rubbed my feet for like 10 minutes.\\n\\nMassage ends, my ass crack and balls are still greasy AF, like practically dripping in Chinese motor oil and I\\'m just puzzled and wondering why tonight after 5 years of this place being legit and totally not sexual is this happening.\\n\\nI walk out (with a greasy anus, it feels weird to walk) and this massage girl is standing there at the front desk with the customary cup of water and I take it without making eye contact then pay my $40 and give her the $20 tip and figure I\\'ll just duck out and pretend nothing happened because I\\'m not in the mood to prolong this awkwardness. But then the massage girl literally looks at the $20 bill like it was a $1 bill and SCREAMS something in Chinese at which point the woman at the desk snaps back at her and points at the door that leads to the rooms for her to go back there. It was kind of the gesture you\\'d use if you were talking to a misbehaving dog. Then the desk lady says \"oh she say most give her $50 or $60\" and I\\'m just like \"um I come here a lot and I always give $20\" and then the lady says \"it\\'s okay next time you ask for susu you can give $50\" and then I\\'m just doing that awkward mini bow to Asian people even though I\\'m not Asian thing as I nope the F out of there because I am thinking I need to find a new cheap massage place. I never even asked for susu!\\n\\nEdit: Somebody paid me 250 coins and now I feel like an anal prostitute. Thanks reddit. \\n\\nTL;DR Got a greasy anus after an ass and ball rub that I didn\\'t want and never asked for. This happened last night in a 420-legal state, so no laws were broken in the making of this TIFU. Burner because reasons.\\n\\nAfter taking a break from smoking for a few months, I decided to break out an indica-hybrid vape cartridge I bought a while ago and let the good times roll. I’ve been hitting it the past few days, and each time I get higher than a kite because my tolerance is so low now and I don’t know when to stop hitting it.\\n\\nI was on Facebook yesterday morning when I was sober, and in one of my meme groups saw a screenshot of a post about a 23-year-old college student who died after eating pasta that had been left out five days. The top comment on it was “he pasta way,” and that just stuck with me because it was so funny.\\n\\nLater that night, I was cleaning out my fridge and came across two containers of food I had brought back with me from home (I’m a college senior and the semester started two weeks ago). One of the containers was a tortellini salad, and I noticed it had a “sell by” date of four days before. I was about to throw it out, then decided to smell it and try a piece given the proximity of the sell by date. I had one piece of tortellini, decided it might be alright, and put it back to figure it out later.\\n\\nA few hours later, the high times have come and I’m hitting my vape pen. After watching a Rodney Dangerfield classic, I go up to bed and am lying there when all of a sudden I start feeling a sense of doom. I start imagining every hypochondriac symptom in the book, from chest pain, to stomach pain, to shortness of breath, etc. \\n\\nAt the same time, all I could see in my head was “he pasta way” and started thinking that I was an almost 23-year-old college senior and I ate pasta that was approximately five days expired. I suddenly realized that I never saw the guy’s name or where it happened in the screenshot, and started freaking out thinking it was about me. Shortly thereafter the EMT side of me takes over, checks that I have a pulse when I’ve pretty much convinced myself my heart has stopped, and I basically run an out-of-body patient assessment on myself to make sure I’m alive. I fell asleep, and just woke up after 12 hours.\\n\\nTL;DR got so high I thought I had seen my own death before it happened \\nSo I’ll begin where I left off yesterday.\\n\\n[original post if you haven’t seen it](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/iooq39/tifu_by_putting_my_boss_in_the_hospital/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) \\n\\nParamedics loaded my boss onto a wheeled stretcher (or whatever they call them) and put him in the back of an ambulance to go off to the hospital. I seriously thought that he was in big trouble because the paramedics were treating him like he was having a severe heart attack. He looked like he was on the verge of dying as they loaded him up. \\n\\nAnyway, afterwards my other manager tells us all to go home. It was Labor Day so there weren’t that many people working. I go home and am freaking out, nervous as hell until my manager called me and told me my boss was stable but it was close. “Come in tomorrow for work at 10am we need to have a discussion”\\n\\nAt this point I’m double freaking out because I’m thinking “shit I’m going to get fired over a stupid ass spider prank.”\\n\\nI get into work at about 950 and I make the dreaded trip up to my desk. At this point everyone in the office knew I basically killed our boss and literally everyone stopped to stare at me. I just kinda tried to keep my head down as I was thoroughly embarrassed. \\n\\nI got to my cubicle and my manager was already standing there, “don’t put your stuff away this will take just a moment.” \\n\\nHe takes me to my bosses office. Which I thought he was going to ask what the spider on the fishing line was doing there and then, after I answered, fire me. \\n\\nDoor was already open and after I walk in my manager tells me to take a seat and then he closes the door after I step in (he stayed out).\\n\\nI sat down, pretty much sweating out of my clothes and all the sudden, to add insult to injury, my boss sneaks up behind me and yells “THOUGHT I WAS DEAD HUH!!!” \\n\\nWell at that point I basically shit my pants frightened like a little girl seeing a monster in the closet. He claps me on the back and I turn around. The fucker is wearing no shoes and was hiding behind the door to creep up behind me.\\n\\nAt this point I’m both relieved, terrified, and just generally shook. And he sits down and tells me how he did it.\\n\\nApparently the manager (my buddy from last post) that let me in early on Labor Day told him about my entire plan. My boss knew about the spider and pretty much planned around my move\\n\\nThe fucker literally let a bunch of workers have a half day to foil my prank and got his EMT buddy to make a quick stop by to “treat his heart attack.” \\n\\nI’m never pranking my boss again. On a good note I’m not fired\\n\\nTl;dr had a juicy prank for my boss, he faked a heart attack, let half the workers have a 1/2 day, scared the shit out of me by coming back to life, and now I’m not fired and never pranking again.\\n\\n\\nEdit: wow had no idea this was going to become popular. Thanks for all the awards and stuff guys and thanks for all the kind words. I hope y’all have a good rest of the week :)\\n\\n**EDIT 2** [hey guys Ive been getting a lot of messages about how it went down so I’ll show you a video of basically what happened](https://youtu.be/0H6n1aK0ZSo) So usual disclaimer, this happened last week not today but I\\'ve only just recovered enough to talk about it. \\n\\nAlso for context I am a detective with the police which was on my profile.\\n\\nSo I have been single a few months now and finally decided to give those tinder style apps a go. I was recommended Bumble by a colleague which is essentially just tinder but bee themed.\\n\\nI downloaded the app Thursday and by Friday I had a date so I thought things were going well. First date I arrange for Saturday at a busy shopping centre.\\n\\nNow I\\'ve been out of the dating game for a while and we were chatting about movies so we went to go to the cinema to see Mortal Engines.\\n\\nI knew the first greeting was always going to be awkward, the whole \"hey is that x? 《YOU NOW HAVE 1 SECOND TO DECIDE ON KISS ON CHEEK, AWKWARD HUG OR LAME WAVE THING》 but what happened was none of those things. Instead I get hit with \" TELL ME WHO YOU ARE I NEED TO VERIFY YOU\" which not going to lie is as romantic a greeting as smearing yourself with marmite and announcing \"let\\'s have a toast for the pretty lady!\"\\n\\nAnyway she then asks \"WHAT\\'S THAT ON THE FLOOR\" pointing to a large pile of dust. It\\'s a pile of dust I tell her and she makes me double check.\\n\\nDust confirmed we move on to the cinema and purchase tickets the announcer in my brain exclaimes 《YOU ARE NOW LOCKED INTO THE DATE》\\n\\nWe got an hour and a half till the movie so we grab some ice cream cause that\\'s cute as shit and head to Starbucks (which fyi is a crowded mutherflucker) grab a table and she leans close... zero chill just dead pan asks me \"...what\\'s the darkest job you have ever dealt with...\" \\n\\nNow I\\'ve got some H.P. Lovecraft dark stories so I try to give her a PG version of a double murder I had some involvement with. (Note: everything I discussed could also be easily read about online)\\n\\n\"HOW DID HE KILL THEM? WAS THERE A LOT OF BLOOD? DID YOU SEE IT? WAS IT LIKE THE MOVIES? I LOVE MURDER STORIES, HAVE YOU SEEN MAKING A MURDERER? HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT X MURDER? DID YOU KNOW THIS ONE GUY ONCE CHOPPED HIS MUM\\'S HEAD OFF AND HAD SEX WITH THE CORPSE ISN\\'T THAT FACINATING?!?!\"\\n\\n(Let me just remind you it\\'s as crowded as balls in leather pants in this coffee shop and people are looking over)\\n\\nShe also hits me with a few probing questions \"Have you ever committed a crime? Have you ever done drugs?!\"\\n\\nTrying to recover some semblance of a date I joke \"haha only if you count downloading showbox as a crime\"\\n\\nNext it\\'s my turn to ask some questions and throw out the classic \"Tell me about your self\" (I know it\\'s lame but I panicked)\\n\\n\"Oh I\\'ve just been released from 18 months locked up in a psyche ward in Broadmoor, it was pretty much a doss and I got to meet people like naked Phillip\"\\n\\nNow gripped with what can only be described as the terror a double D breasted woman feels in a slasher flick I decide I have two choices.\\n\\n1) Run into the crowd and disappear\\n\\n2) continue date (what could go wrong in a cinema? It\\'s just 2 hours of awkward silence)\\n\\nLet\\'s just say I chose poorly...\\n\\nBefore we move off though she asks me to search her chair... I don\\'t really do much except say it\\'s fine but after walking off she decides my efforts were not good enough and goes back to search it properly.\\n\\nFinally into the cinema now 10 minutes after start time so it\\'s adverts but most people have sat down... of course there are people in our seat, what looks like a family of 14 parts like the Red Sea so we can sit in the seats we paid for but they are somewhat miffed.\\n\\nSuddenly my date whips out the flashlight on her phone and starts search the chair! The woman from the family is also some nutbar and starts yelling \"MY EYES! TURN OFF THAT LIGHT!! ARRGHHFYFBIFWYH\"\\n\\nmy date sits down in darkness for a whole 5 minutes before deciding that she wants to have a round two of flashlight rodeo.... cue raging snickers lady \"I\\'M GOING TO KNOCK YOU OUT I TOLD YOU TURN THAT LIGHT OFF\" \\n\\nI\\'m not about to white knight defend this woman, I\\'m a god damn spectator here! The fruit and nut villain is eventually calmed down by her fella.\\n\\nDate goes for lucky number 3 flashlight gamble, this time I have to step in and say thus is not ok.\\n\\nSo movie time. I\\'m sure Mortal Engines is a fine film... but it\\'s pretty out there and loooong. All I\\'m thinking about is the 3 pieces of advice I was given prior to app dating\\n\\n1) don\\'t get drunk\\n2) don\\'t send dick pics\\n3) don\\'t stick your dick in crazy \\n\\nSo despite the horror movie Mortal Engines has become I am still a man and she is still an attractive woman so I\\'m repeating number 3) again and again in my head like a monk trying to achieve enlightenment. Lucky the date is so bad and my fear so palpable that logic wins out.\\n\\nAfter the movie she goes to the bathroom and hands me her coat and bag, can\\'t run yet... got to wait...\\n\\nShe returns dead serious \"I NEED YOU TO FOLLOW ME\"\\n\\nthis is where I die i think, I\\'m being lured to the bathroom to be filleted like a fish and used as a skin suit in some crazy sex game.\\n\\nShe walks me to an isolated area and points at an especially large pile of dust\\n\\n\"WHAT\\'S THAT?\"\\n\\nI say just a large pile of dust \"ARE YOU SURE, CAN YOU CHECK\" \\n\\nSure enough it\\'s just dust...\\n\\nSo keen to make good my escape I lay down a \"woah look at the time... 8:30! Got to grab that train\" she responds \"you know I\\'m really thirsty... could really go for a drink!\"\\n\\nNot willing to be the 3rd party to a human centipede I push on \"central line that\\'s Me! Oh you too? Great...\" \\n\\nNext she smashes out a \"you know the Overground train for me is an hour wait.... I don\\'t really want to wait an hour... so thirsty...\" \\n\\nThe next stop I just decided the wrong station was the right place to be, \"oh look at This! Haha my stop lovely to meet you BYE\" \\n\\nThe journey home was the most paranoia driven thriller of my 29 years...\\n\\nTLDR\\n\\nMy first date in years was with someone murder obsessed and recently released from a mental health facility. Now too scared to date anyone ever again. This didn\\'t happen today, it was actually last summer.\\n\\nMy family of 5, plus my boyfriend went on a road trip to camp on the beach a few hours away. We have a minivan so that we could all travel together. Overall it was about a 4 day round trip once we got there and stayed a couple days before coming back. Needless to say, my boyfriend and I weren\\'t able to fool around during this time.\\n\\nOn the way back my boyfriend and I were sitting in the back of the van. Everyone was ahead of us, so they couldn\\'t see us without turning around.\\n\\nWe started texting some naughty things about what we\\'d like to do to each other and I got extremely turned on. This went on for quite a while and progressed into us touching ourselves while we were looking longingly at each other. Needless to say, I was SOAKED.\\n\\nOf course, since we were driving and my dad is pretty stingy with bathroom breaks I couldn\\'t exactly clean myself up. My underwear were completely soaked and I had no option but to sit in it until we got home.\\n\\nWhen we got home all was good. My bf and I snuck off to have sex and it was great.\\n\\nHowever, if you are aware of female hygiene practices at all, sitting in a wet bathing suit or underwear is a big no no. Your lady parts are supposed to stay pretty dry for the most part.\\n\\nFor several hours that day, mine did not, and I payed for it by waking up the next day with the absolute worst yeast infection I have ever experienced. It was horriible and took over a week of embarrassing-to-buy over the counter drugs to fix it. Will NOT be doing that again!\\n\\n\\nTl;dr got so horny I gave myself a yeast infection\\n\\n\\nEdit: Holy crap guys, that\\'s a lot of upvotes! Thanks for laughing at my pain!! 😁 Throwaway account so imma get very pissed if this gets a lot of points.\\n\\nSo I live with my family and my dog spends her nights in my room which means walking her in the mornings is usually my responsibility. This morning (obligatory this actually happened today) i went downstairs and open the door to let the dog out first before putting on shoes and grabbing my keys, in case she was bursting to go (i got up quite late since i graduated high school and pretty much just lounge about helping out at home) she can do it outside rather than in the house. By the time i’d gotten ready though the dog was nowhere to be seen.\\n\\nNow i wasn’t too concerned since she can’t get past the locked gate, so i knew she wasn’t lost. After searching the garden i figured she must have done what she needed to do, and snuck back in to get another nap in (she’s a lazy pupper). I went back inside and, since the rest of the house was still asleep (or so i thought), i didn’t want to yell for her, so i resorted to check each room.\\n\\nSo the sleeping arrangements in my family is kind of unusual. I have a small sister who doesn’t like to spend the night alone, so she chooses a parent to spend the night with in the double bed, while the remaining parent is “banished” to her room with the twin size bed, i get my own room. After checking the dog is not in mine or the small bedroom, i figured she’d gone to snuggle with my sister and dad in the big bedroom, so i went in to drag her out because _dammit_ i was determined to get my morning walk.\\n\\nIn i went, and it took me about 30 seconds to realise my mistake: the silhouette in the single bed had been way too small to be my mum. They must have gotten up, carried my sleeping sister to her own room, my mum snuck in with my dad, because there they were, on the double bed, _going at it_\\n\\nTurns out 30 seconds wasn’t fast enough to piece the story together because just as i realised and panicked and tried to leave, my mum looks up and we make solid eye contact while i’m pretty sure my dad’s dick was still inside her (not that i was keen to verify or think about it). I was catatonic as this point and my brain shut down and i just turned on my heels and left, with a deadpan expression this whole time.\\n\\nMy sister is no longer allowed to sleep in the big bedroom. And yes, turns out the dog was indeed in the room at the time.\\n\\nTL;DR: let my dog slip into my parent’s bedroom, went in to get her, broke my 18 years streak of managing to avoid catching my parents in the act of producing more siblings for me.\\n\\nEdit: let the records show that the first thing i did after getting tf out of that room was to check on my sister (who was awake by this time) and tell her to leave our parents alone for a while. Little back story, I live in Belgium where we have fairly solid Euthanasia laws. Without knowing all the details, it basically requires a lot of paperwork and a couple of signatures (in our case my sister and myself, and a 3rd witness); and all this needs to be renewed every 5 years. It\\'s basically a will/permission that gives my sister and I the authority to decide in his name (i.e. respect his wishes) if he is no longer able to himself. Last June he had a stroke at age 77 and has since mostly recovered. Accordingly we discovered that the paperwork needed to be renewed around this time of the year.\\n\\nMy sister is the principal contact on the paperwork and as such she was going to take care of it (like she has always done before). She is a schoolteacher and this morning the schools are opening again, so the past weeks have been a bit hectic for her.\\n\\nLast night I went to bed around 3 a.m. and this morning shortly after 8 am - while still sleeping -  I get a call from a city clerk. The paperwork was still missing the signature of my dad, and apparently she had been trying to contact my sister to no avail. So she reached out to me before it expires and gave me an appointment in about 2 hours from now.\\n\\nMy dad recently became my neighbor, and is usually already awake this time of the day sitting in his office. So still somewhat sleeping I put on pants and walk over to his house. Oddly enough he is still sleeping so I wake him up (which requires specialized skills).\\n\\n\"*Huh what*?\"\"*wake up dad*\"\"*huh? oh its you? huh what*\"\"*they called for your Euthanasia, we need to be there at 11h15*\" (im still not fully awake)\\n\\nHe looks totally bemused at me, sits on the bedside for a couple of seconds and gives me this look of utter defeat and says: \"*well shit, that\\'s fast*\". To which I say, \"*well we still have more than 3 hours, so no rush, I\\'ll pick you up around 11, cya*\".He mumbles totally disappointed: \"*3 hours and you gonna leave me alone*\"? At which point my penny drops (technically speaking eurocent): \"*you stay in the car, I pick up the paperwork, you sign it, I return it and we are good again for 5 years, turns out my sis forgot something*\".\\n\\nNever seen him being more relieved before in my life! Turns out he had been dreaming about it in some way or form and me putting it like that made it all a little bit too realistic for him.\\n\\nTL;DR while being sleepdrunk I woke up my dad and told him we get to do his Euthanasia later this morning. He took it a bit too literal.\\n\\n*Edit 1: It is my dad his own decision that he wants to be euthanized if he ever ends up in a situation where he has to live in a vegetative state with zero quality of life. He talked about this extensively with his doctor, with the family, friends, ...  At first I wasn\\'t very happy to sign that paper, but in the end it\\'s his choice. And respecting his whish is important to me. There is a whole process involved: first off all the paperwork which can be seen as his will/testament. Second off, if god forbid he ever ends up in such a situation, there is another legal process we\\'ll have to go through before it can happen. Third off, there is no way whatsoever that me or anyone who signed that document can enforce anything while he is still mentally sound.* \\n\\n*Edit 2: When this conversation took place my dad was somewhere in the middle between sleeping, dreaming and waking up. And I wasn\\'t fully awake yet either, or else I\\'d have just told him \"they called for your Euthanasia* ***paperwork, it\\'s missing a signature,***  *we need to be there at 11h15\".* \\n\\n*It\\'s as simple as me failing to form a coherent sentence (not fully awake yet) towards my dad who is still in lalala land. Some of these comments are batshit crazy.* Obligatory, this happened a few weeks ago.\\n\\nSo I gave one of my coworkers a ride home a few Fridays ago. Him and I started chatting about people who work at town hall in the next town over. I had mentioned that my grandmother had worked their for 40 years and I mentioned the last name of my grandmother (for the sake of this post i’m just gonna say the last name is Smith).\\n\\nHe told me that he has relation to the Smiths also so him and I started digging into how we are related. \\n\\nI asked him if we could call his father or mother and he told me his father had passed away when he was young. I asked him what happened if he didn’t mind sharing and he said he really doesn’t know, no one will tell him which is okay because he doesn’t really want to know anyway.\\n\\nSo we keep digging, we tried calling a bunch of our family members but they didn’t answer the phones, except for my aunt.\\n\\nMind you we are in the car at the moment and my phone is hooked up to the speakers so anything anyone says on the phone can be heard by everyone in the car. \\n\\nI get in touch with my aunt and I ask her how we are related to his side of the family, she basically told me that my great grandmothers sister is his great grandmother. So all in all, pretty far line down to be considered close cousins. \\n\\nMy aunt keeps talking and she asked me why I asked? I told her that my coworker and I found out that he’s somehow related to the Smiths and we were trying to see a connection. She asked me what his name was and I said (for the sake of this post we will refer to him as Bob) Bob. I completely failed to mention to her that he was in the car with me at the moment. She says, “Oh, his father unfortunately hanged himself a few years ago”\\n\\nI tried to mutter her out of what she was saying but failed to do so and Bob heard everything. I saw his eyes widen and what seemed to me, pale. I just told my aunt thank you and hung up the phone completely embarrassed that he found this out in not the most ideal way. \\n\\nBob said to me “Well that explains a lot” I didn’t want to pry so I just said yea and i’m sorry. He didn’t really say much after that and he left. Whenever I see him at work now it’s really awkward for us and I think it really messed him up. I feel so bad but not sure what to do as I don’t want to bring up his fathers death at all.\\n\\nTL;DR\\nTried to find out how me and my coworker were related (whose father passed away and doesn’t know nor doesn’t want to know how he died) and my aunt accidentally blurted out that his father hung himself without knowing I was on speaker.\\n\\nUpdate: Saw everyone’s advice this morning and decided to talk to him. Gave him a ride home again and talked about it. He said he was kind of happy finally knowing about it because it put his mind at rest. Told him if he ever needs to talk or anything that he can call me up or whatever to talk about it. He thanked me and then we bs’ed for like an hour about whatever. Feels good to have a cousin that I have stuff in common with too, never really had one that I got along with.\\n\\nAlso, saw some comments referring to him saying he didn’t want to know about his fathers death and the immediately after I said we kept digging. We kept digging about the relation, not his fathers death. Just to clear that up. so this happened yesterday, and I\\'ve yet to see what the results of my stupidity are\\n\\nIt is important to know that I was suicidal a year or so ago. I still have depression and anxiety though. Also, this is a high school, and my school takes mental health **very seriously**.\\n\\nSo for my English class, I required to write an essay responding to a prompt on the list of prompts my teacher gave me. I decided to do the \"3 stages of life\" one, but instead of the classic \"Birth, life, and death\" stages, I made the stages of my life \"Bliss, Pain, Unknown.\"  For Bliss I wrote about my childhood and how nice it was to be a lil kid. For pain, I write about how depressed I got during high school and how I wake up everyday and think about how badly I want to die. Then for Unknown, I wrote about how peaceful everything would probably be after I die. I said I was looking forward to my death too. Once I finished, I submitted it online without even reading through the whole thing once because I was right up against the deadline for submission\\n\\nSo fast forward to me, in my English class, about to read this essay out loud in front of a few of my classmates because we were supposed to \"peer review\" each other\\'s essays. I read mine, and realized that it low key sounds like a suicide note. The people in my peer review group were shocked, and they tried to talk me out of killing myself (I never said I would kill myself, and I have no intention of doing so, but I did say in the essay that I was looking forward to dying, and I guess that made them think imma kill myself)\\n\\nSo now im just sitting there thinking to myself \"shit I just read a suicide note to my classmates! please don\\'t tell anyone please don\\'t tell anyone please don\\'t tell anyone\"\\n\\nSo now im pretty sure that my teacher\\'s gonna read my essay and tell somebody about my mental health, or even worse, she might tell my parents\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR; I accidentally wrote a suicide note and turned it in for my English essay assignment, and I had to read it out loud in front of a few of my classmates.\\n\\nEdit: y’all thanks for all the support, I really appreciate it! I’m at school right now but when I get home I’ll read all your comments.\\n\\nEdit 2: again, thanks for y’all’s support it means a lot to me. Also, thank you to those who showed me that LongBeachGriffy video that really made me smile a little bit. If anything interesting happens regarding this story, I’ll be sure to update yall\\n\\nupdate: nothing interesting happened. my teacher handed the assignment back and she wrote just a generic “hang in there it gets better” message My girlfriend and I are from two different neighbouring countries. I am from Hungary and she is from Slovakia. We communicate in English, but naturally we have begun slowly learning each other’s languge. As I learn more and more words and phrases, I like to put what I know already to use and speak to her family in Slovak whenever I can (they speak English as well, so I don’t *have* to do this).\\n\\nWhen I learned that ‘na obed’ is their equivalent of ‘for lunch’, I was making a lot of stupid jokes by prepending random words that I know to this construct. I mostly made this ‘jokes’ to her and her sister. However, this one time I saw her mother preparing some seeds for the birds they keep in the living room. Having previously learned that ‘bird’ is ‘ftak’ in Slovak, I thought this was a perfect opportunity for me to present my knowledge of the language.\\n\\nSo I asked her, smiling: ‘Obed na ftak?’\\n\\nThen this genius idea crossed my mind to make a stupid joke: ‘…or ftak na obed?’\\n\\nMy gf’s older sister burst out in hysterical laughter, shortly followed by her mother.\\n\\nIt would have been good for me to know that ‘ftak’ is also common slang for ‘penis’, meaning I have basically enquired if she would like ‘dick for lunch’. Her mother and sister periodically remind me of the story by proposin ftak for lunch when discussing ideas for the next day…\\n\\nTL; DR:\\nI showed off my knowledge of my gf’s language to her family by proposing we have dicks for lunch. So yesterday the alternator on my car died, I went and picked up a new one today that I’m going to install this weekend. No biggie, but it meant I had to borrow my dads truck to go to work today. Now my dad has a newer pickup with a Bluetooth radio, so I synched my phone up, put on some music and went to work. \\n\\nLater, once I went home I decided to have some “me” time and watch some “special video’s”. Around the 4th video when I was really getting into it, the audio suddenly cut off. Puzzled, it took me a few seconds to realized the horror of what had happened.... My dad turned his truck on to go check the mail and was greeted with a full volume, near orgasm, porn moan when he did. \\n\\nWhen he got home, I was standing in the kitchen and awkwardly made eye contact with him and died a little inside. All he said was “what the fuck son”. \\n\\nTL:DR- I borrowed my dads truck and synched my phone to it. Went home and watched porn and my dad was greeted with the sound of a moaning porn-star when he started his truck\\n\\nEdit: words.  This just happened. I\\'m still trying to process....and to not pee my pants.\\n\\nMy husband went outside to put out the trash, since its midnight he wore a head lamp. He comes back inside looking a little pale but also like he found something really cool. \\n\\nTurns out he read somewhere on reddit that you can see a spider\\'s eye shine in the grass. He told me about it and said it was interesting. \\n\\nNow here\\'s the fuck up. I asked him to show me.  I should probably mention that I have arachnophobia. Like legit pee my pants, cry, throw my kids out of my way while I run for my life arachnophobia. I thought I could handle it. I thought it would be one sparkly reflection. I thought it would be ok cuz I wouldn\\'t actually *see* a spider. \\n\\nI was wrong.\\n\\nSo very very *very* wrong. There had to be hundreds of spider eyes reflecting back at me. I\\'m not sure how I made it back in the house but I was told screaming was involved. Now I\\'m terrified of leaving my house. \\n\\nTLDR spiders. Arachnophobia.  Never leaving my house again.\\n\\n*edited to add\\nHokywowbatman now I know what RIP my inbox means. I never thought this post would get any views. So.....\\n\\n1. Thank you everyone for the advice on getting therapy, I will definitely follow up on it. I do not want to live this way.\\n\\n2. Phobia is an *irrational* fear. If I could \"grow the fuck up\" and \"get over it\" and \"stop being such a baby\" and all the other unhelpful comments that were sent to me, believe me I would. Who wants to be scared of a thing that is teeny tiny compared to you.\\n\\n3. Also for the people in #2 ... fuck you. This just happened a couple of hours ago. I am 8 months pregnant and *huge*. So I am in the choir at my church, and we were singing a special Christmas song, so everyone was supposed to dress festively. I also had to sing a solo before the message, which I was *very* nervous for. \\n\\nI picked out a nice red maternity dress with beading on the collar and wore black tights with black velvet kitten heels. I even painted my nails to match. \\n\\nThe first service went smoothly... but when I got home, I noticed I had prominent underarm sweat showing on my dress. *Great*, that’s probably what everyone was staring at during my solo, lol. So I was determined to prevent this from happening in the second service an hour later. I took off the dress, dried it off, and changed into some pajamas to have breakfast. I also put on an undershirt and stuffed a bunch of tissues under my arms so I wouldn’t sweat next time.\\n\\nBefore I knew it, I was running a bit behind, so I put my dress and shoes back on and hustled out the door. I got to the church a minute before the service started and rushed out of my car. Someone asked if it was too windy for me. We’re in South Florida, so I had no idea what they were talking about and continued rushing for the doors. \\n\\nUnfortunately, the service began a moment earlier and the choir was already on stage. I grabbed my songbook and lumbered onto the stage from the middle aisle, to my place front and center with the other sopranos. Everyone smiled at me awkwardly, which I figured was due to my tardiness.\\n\\nWe started with a hymn... That’s when I realized I felt too much fabric around my legs for the kind of dress I was wearing. I worried that the tissues from my arms had fallen and people could see them stuck to my tights or something. I could not see past my belly easily, so I leaned over to check, as conspicuous as it was to do so...\\n\\nThe sight and accompanying horror took a moment to register. There they were, my pink and teal flamingo print pajama pants. Still on my legs. And the whole audience sees them. How the freak did I not notice, and how did I get on stage without anyone telling me?!? \\n\\nI rushed off the stage mid-song and took the offending pants off in the bathroom, then waddled back up to my spot. I couldn’t even run off afterwards and hide, because I had to sing a solo immediately after that! On the bright side, my stage fright for that was gone...\\n\\nTLDR: Changed clothes in a hurry between performances at church. Unintentionally sang on stage wearing flamingo pajama pants because I’m huge and can’t see my legs.  \\n**Edit: this has been shadow removed and I was given no notice. Cool, thanks mods. Fuck you too. I broke 0 rules.**\\n\\n**Edit; it’s back up. Weird. Sorry I cussed at you, mods. Twas rude of me** \\n\\n\\nSo, my brother is an officer and recently told me a story about a naked homeless man breaking into someone’s home and taking a nap on their couch. So obviously the first thing that came to mind was to hide in his attic fully nude and wait for him to get home so I could give him a good scare. \\n\\nIt took a lot longer than I expected and I live in Texas so attics are exactly a comfortable place to hangout. After about 30 minutes I decided it was an awful idea to continue and a safe idea to go get some water and clothes. \\n\\nOn my way down the attic stairs I heard a loud scream. It was his girlfriend who I never heard get home. She said all she saw was bare ass and thought it was a homeless man like my brother had just encountered. Not wanting to get shot, I immediately started yelling her name and identifying myself. She slapped me a few times and told me to leave. My brother wasn’t too happy but couldn’t hide a smirk as he told me I’m an idiot and lucky nothing bad happened (which is true). \\nSo now there’s a rule against me having keys to anybody’s house. (This happened 2 days ago.). \\n\\nTL;DR; tried to sneak attack my brother from above but instead scarred his girlfriend for life.\\n\\nEdit: I’ve had fun with you guys, thanks for all the responses. Disabling replies now; can’t keep up and getting the “fuck your brother” comments isn’t fun so I’ll just shush. Rather not have politics in the thread but I did it to myself the second I said cop, so feel free to discuss but keep it civil so it’ll hopefully be conversation and not just arguing. Take care everyone!\\n\\n (Black lives matter. Police brutality exists. China fucking sucks. Donald is a terrible president. Etc etc. we all agree on most of these things. Loving my brother is not wrong, so bitch at me all you want. You’re not helping anything by talking shit on a reddit thread though) Full disclosure, this happened several years ago (and he is now my ex boyfriend), but something made me remember this story today.\\n\\nMy ex-boyfriend was a big fan of grand gestures and surprise dates. He took me to all kinds of cool stuff to surprise me, like an Obon Festival, a special old school Star Trek movie showing, an art museum, even a surprise interstate road trip on my birthday! For his birthday, I resolved to pay him back with his own nice surprise. We had been together for \\\\~10 months at that point, so I thought I knew what would suit him: a picnic at a beautiful outdoor conservatory, a walk around the zoo, and the surprise: tickets to a butterfly conservatory, basically a glass dome filled with lush greenery, flowers, and hundreds of butterfly species flying freely. [(Not this specific one, but this video gives you an idea what it\\'s like)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeMo5o46rso)\\n\\nI had always gone to the butterfly house with my family as a little kid and I loved it soooooo much. It was special to me and I was so excited to share it with him.\\n\\nHe was having a great time walking around with me by the lakes and at the picnic. I kept hyping him up, saying \"I can\\'t wait until the final surprise, I hope you love it! You\\'re going to love it!\"\\n\\nWe got to the entrance, they tore our tickets, and I led him in Belle-at-the-library-in-Beauty-&-the-Beast style. I still won\\'t shut up, trying to get him hyped. Finally, the moment of truth: I took my hands off his eyes and watched him behold the kaleidoscopic beauty surrounding him.\\n\\nImmediately, his face blanched and he looked like someone had just punched him in the stomach.\\n\\nHe was cowering and clinging to my arm when a butterfly flew past him.\\n\\n\"Umm... are you OK, dear?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m.... fine...\" he said with a classic Hide the Pain Harold grimace.\\n\\n\"You don\\'t seem fine. Did something happen?\"\\n\\nHe looked ill and muttered \"why would people pay to go to a place people let disgusting bugs land on them\". I must have looked hurt because he tried to pull himself together, put on a brave face, and grabbed my arm tight. Before we could even get going any further, he pulled away from me and started shouting \"OH GOD, IT\\'S IN YOUR HAIR, IT\\'S IN YOUR HAIR.\" Before I could even tell what was going on, he had tried to run out the exit with employees chasing him, calling \"wait! we have to check you for stowaway butterflies!\" It was chaos. Kids were watching him from their strollers. Some were screaming and crying. \\n\\nWhen I finally caught up with him, he had thrown up in the trash can by the duck pond. I apologized profusely and he said it wasn\\'t my fault - his fear of moths/butterflies just hadn\\'t come up in conversation yet. I couldn\\'t have known.\\n\\nWe just kind of stared blankly at the pond until he said, \"Let\\'s just go home.\" \\n\\nIt took me months before I felt comfortable trying to surprise him again, and surprise surprise, I managed to screw that up too. (it\\'s the Nightmare Redux: Thai Surprise in the comments)\\n\\nTL;DR: I accidentally traumatized my moth-phobic now-ex-boyfriend by enclosing him in a space with hundreds of butterflies. \\n\\nEDIT: Sorry, I accidentally deleted like half this post trying to edit it. Dang. I hope I cobbled it back together properly. \\n\\n1. Please don\\'t be mean, phobias are irrational by definition. It\\'s not his fault. \\n2. I was really dumb and young in this story and I don\\'t try to surprise people anymore (unless it\\'s something they explicitly said they wanted). I thought it was fair game to try to share something from my childhood because he had taken me to a mediocre Fargo pizza place that was his favorite childhood restaurant just a few weeks earlier. \\n\\nHe did also have surprise cheesecake waiting for him when he got back (favorite dessert), so at least the day wasn\\'t destroyed completely. So this has happened over the last month and half coming to a head yesterday.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI started a new job, admin, about a month and a half ago. I do pretty basic administrative work: check deposits, filing, follow ups, etc. It\\'s a full time gig, and it might take me HALF of the day to do all my duties. I don\\'t know who had this job last, but they fucked around A LOT. I try to fuck around and I still get things done SUPER fast. This has led to frustration for me and my supervisor because I run out of things to do, and I have to interrupt her work so she can find things for me to do.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBtw, I am not the kind of person where I enjoy getting paid to do nothing. Sure, it\\'s nice on occasion, but not half of the day every single day.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nFast forward to yesterday: I ask my supervisor if there was anything I could work on, and she asks me to shut her door. She asks me how I feel about getting my hours cut. Not just by a few hours. She\\'s thinking me being there 25 HOURS PER WEEK! That\\'s significant.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMoral of the story: don\\'t do your best because you will get punished for it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\ntl:dr I did my job too well and got my hours cut for it\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT: Thank you to everyone on the \"real world\" advice. It does suck, but that\\'s the way it goes, I suppose. My boss called me into his office to talk about the situation. He firstly apologized for suggesting hours being cut before they had a game plan. He made it very clear that he and the company appreciates my work ethic and initiative and that they DO NOT want to lose me as an employee. Apparently, when they hired me on there was originally going to be more work duties for me, but for some reason out of his control, that didn\\'t happen. They are going to merge me into another area so I can fulfill a normal working week, not have hours cut, and most importantly keep my pay.   **For the record: the girl I\\'m seeing encouraged me to create an actual account to share this fuck up. I have read some crazy ass stories on here so, uh, it\\'s hard to tell if this post will even come close to the standard of this sub.** \\n\\n*Shrug*\\n\\n**S\\'up.**\\n\\nThis happened last weekend. \\n\\nI went to my friend\\'s house party wearing nothing but my panda onesie. I thought underwear would be overkill since it gets so damn hot in that thing. So, I eliminated the unnecessary layers and went commando. Oof. It was freeing. The penis was a swingin\\' and the balls was a breathin\\'. Pure cock flopping fun I tell thee. And so... off I go... with a hop and skip... and a bouncing dick. \\n\\nCut to me and this cute girl grinding on the dance floor. Her ass was rubbing against me so fucking hard, it triggered **the boner.** Aw, fuuuck! It\\'s gonna stick out like a sore thumb underneath this damn onesie. I literally spin her ass around so it doesn\\'t touch my dick no more. Worst. Fucking. Mistake.\\xa0This girl, in the heat of the moment, rips open my onesie, exposing my bare boner for all to see. As if that wasn\\'t bad enough, my dick *fucking flexes* right before I cover up. Folks there lost their shit. Dick jokes, drunken laughter, cat-calls & whistles, all erupted in that moment. I questioned so many life choices as I stood there, frozen and flustered as fuck. \\n\\nFor the rest of that night I had to dodge a mob of wasted degenerates on a mission to rip me open. The motherfuckers called it the Panda Challenge.\\n\\n*Edit: Thanks for the Platinum, Silver & Gold, kind souls!*\\n\\n*TL;DR I went commando and ended up partying so hard my penis popped out and joined the fun in front of everyone.* Amidst the hate and questioning of my sexuality, there was actually some fantastic advice in the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c5toeo/tifu_deepthroating_myself_in_front_of_my_new/). I came into the office today with a pretty clear idea of what I was going to say. I felt okay with myself, but holy shit the closer I got, the more fucking petrified I became. The walk from the front door to the edit bay was a total blur, I felt like I was going to have a heart attack. I kept going back in my head whether or not it was better if she was already in the office or if I was in there first, and maybe if I was first it would seem more intimidating. My mind was going nuts. I got back to the edit bay and peaked in and she was already there, and turned around and saw me kind of creeping in. Just a fucking horrible way to start this.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThen, I proceeded to absolutely butcher my eloquently preplanned speech. I honestly wish I could tell you all exactly what I said but I really don’t remember. I know I apologized, I said something along the lines of each of us probably don’t want to ever have to look at each other again, and I did say that if she felt uncomfortable being here, I’d be happy to help her find another job. She asked if I wanted her to leave and I said of course not.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nShe was kind of looking down the whole time and after I finished my word vomit, she just kind of shook her head and said “what are the fucking odds.” We both started laughing and I came a bit more back to reality and asked again if she was comfortable working together and she said she was. We agreed it might take a while to actually look at each other but luckily our desks have us back to back, Ugh.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI got coffee and came back and she had music on and we kind of worked for a few without speaking but the mood was definitely lighter. Then she asked if she could ask me a few questions. Ohhh boy, lol, but sure.\\n\\n* When did i learn i could do this?\\n* Have i ever done this for a crowd before?\\n\\nand of course...\\n\\n* Does it feel like sucking dick or getting your dick sucked?\\n\\nand..\\n\\n* Are you bi? Do you think it’s kind of gay?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI obliged, I think being back to back helped us talk it out and kind of laugh about it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI asked her how long she has known my friend for. (They met in college). She said that she has always been a bit crazy and a bit of a freak. She said when she told her that this guy she was dating could suck his own dick, she was not at all surprised. I got the feeling this wasn’t the first bizarre scenario she had gotten her in.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI really wanted to ask her if she enjoyed herself but I was worried it was teetering on sexual harassment and honestly working in such close quarters I don’t think I want to know the answer.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo there you have it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOh and no, I do not know if she’s on Reddit. I felt like asking would have drawn attention to it, but there was no mention of my post or anything like that.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\ntl:dr - I did my best, she did hers, it’s awkward but it’ll all be okay.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT:  Okay, I\\'ll answer the questions.\\n\\nI learned with my girlfriend in college.  We were very experimental, and somehow it led to this.  It\\'s been a party trick of mine, lol, since.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNever done it for a crowd before, no.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n(from the original post)\\n\\nSince everyone is asking, I\\'ll offer my thoughts. No, I\\'m not gay or bi, and have never sucked someone elses dick before. Pretty sure being gay or bi involves being attracted to and/or having sexual experiences with people of the same sex. It\\'s my own dick, so I think that conversation is pretty straight forward. By your logic, all of you have given thousands and thousands of handjobs and ew, you\\'ve touched a dick like 10 times today at least.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAs for the \"I\\'ve heard it feels more like sucking a dick than getting your dick sucked\" - I bring it back to the above statement. A handjob obviously doesn\\'t feel the same as jerking off. Kissing your own hand feels different than someone else kissing your hand, etc. etc. I think maybe the first time its unfamiliar to have your own dick in your mouth, or for those of you \"with a friend who told you\" .. they probably only tried it once or twice. But it\\'s become a familiar feeling for me, and it feels wonderful. Better than jerking off that\\'s for sure.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT 2:  Guys, \"party trick\" is just a saying.   This is the only party I have ever done this.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT 3:  No, there are no videos or photos.  But if you live in LA I might give you a private show if you can somehow make my life more awkward. Technically, yesterday I fucked up and today I am abundantly aware.\\n\\nI\\'m in quarantine after testing positive, and my mother currently lives with me, so I\\'m confined to a single 7\\'x9\\' room in my apartment. Needless to say, I\\'m running out of ways to occupy my time pretty quickly. Well, yesterday it happened; I lost all smell and taste. Weird, but at least it gave me something to do! I promptly drank black coffee, then moved on to greater challenges and ate an entire black licorice candy (anise is the devil\\'s flavor) with no effect. Then I had an idea! What about spicy food?\\n\\nNow, I\\'m definitely really white, but I\\'m not \\'jalapeños in chili is too spicy\\' white. So I hopped online and went to my favorite Thai restaurant. I figure this\\'ll be a \\'last hurrah\\' of sorts after I use my new superpower to kickstart the second half of my diet. For their green curry, they had a spice scale of low, medium, adventurous, and native Thai. While I did briefly consider \\'native Thai,\\' logic got the better of me and I went with \\'adventurous.\\'\\n\\nIt was the weirdest experience ever. My entire body was sweating - my *eyeballs* were sweating. I could tell it was spicy and tell it was painful, but in this weird removed way where it didn\\'t really matter. I also couldn\\'t taste a damn thing. The only sensation I had was this sort of numb physical pain and a small voice saying, \"I think pain means you\\'re supposed to stop?\" At this point, my edible kicked in, and I\\'ve been locked in a single room for five days with five more to go and this is by far the most exciting thing I had going on, so I doubled down. Ate the whole damn thing, amazed the entire time at my new abilities.\\n\\nHere we are the day after, and my delicate New England tummy is paying for yesterday\\'s ego trip. My apartment only has one bathroom, and I have to coordinate trips with my mother so as not to put her at greater risk. I flew too close to the sun, folks.\\n\\nTL;DR lost sense of taste from Rona, got bored and high, ate crazy spicy Thai food, now everything hurts.\\n\\nEdit: thank you for the awards! And for reminding me that I can’t taste any pie right now. Not even Thanksgiving pie.\\n\\nSecond edit because some people don’t have good reading comprehension: not only did I get delivery (hence going online) but my mother (tested negative) is the one who picked it up from my building foyer and brought it to my door where I, while wearing a mask, picked it up and brought it inside my room because I’m *quarantined in one single room in my apartment for 10 days.*\\n\\nAnother edit: guys, this is nuts! My most popular posts are of my cat and I get crazy excited when he gets, like, 2k likes (my baby is a star!). Thank you for reading and I’m glad so many people got a chuckle! I did not think as far ahead as I should have when I planned my experiment, but you all have been super nice and helped me kill quite a bit of time! \\n\\nAnd if anyone wants information on CDC recommendations and requirements for quarantining following a positive test, please contact them. That’s what I did and have been following what they directly told me to do. If you have questions, they’re a great resource! I left a message to self-report my results and they called me back a couple days after. This actually happened a few minutes ago. Might as well whore some Reddit karma while my dick stops bleeding. \\n\\nSo this started a few months ago. I noticed a small red bump at the base of my penis, no way it was an STD related thing. Haha virgin Redditor. and I never let it touch public toilets. Also was at the top  left of the base\\n\\nAnyway I noticed it and thought it was a weird thing that just happens and left it alone. Fast forward a couple months and it\\'s getting bigger, I employed my normal strategy of \"nah it\\'s fine\" however a couple of days ago I noticed it\\'s big and red. I looked it up and found out penis pimples or ingrown hairs are not uncommon, but this thing was big. If this sized pimple was on my face I would have popped it a long time ago. But this was more sensitive. \\n\\nI finally resolved to pop this fucker, it hadn\\'t gone away for months and it clearly wasn\\'t going to now. I was ready for the whole shebang, shave to make it easier, find a needle and sterilize it under a flame, have a box of tissue in hand, etc. \\n\\nIf only that had happened... As I was thinking of where to find a needle in my house I had to take a shit. So I do and then the thing fucking pops while I\\'m looking at it. I was actually a bit relieved that pus came out so I could be sure it was a pimple. But after I got the white pus out and it was blood, I realized it was still pretty big. I push onward and kept squeezing, after another layer of blood came out there was ANOTHER layer of pus. THEN an ingrown hair.\\n\\nWhat penis God did I piss off to deserve this??\\n\\nIt was still pretty big so I kept squeezing and a fucking third (albeit smaller) layer of pus came out. I kept squeezing even though it was pretty small and it was just blood coming out. The bleeding stopped quickly and it didn\\'t hurt that bad somehow, I\\'m now waiting to see if it will go away. If not I\\'m going to a doctor. Also not going to fap for a few days, don\\'t want want to reopen the wound and become a bloody wanker. \\n\\nTL;DR penis bump turned out to be a triple pimple and an ingrown hair, had to popped it before any prep work could be done. Hopefully not infected.\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks for the awards lol. The bump has gotten smaller and I\\'m still applying Neosporin regularly, thanks for the tips y\\'all My husband got invited to be a speaker in a conference, but it’ll be in Seoul. He didn’t feel like attending since he finds conferences annoying & hates long flights. But I wanted to go to Korea, and with hotel rooms and his flight paid for, it’ll be a cheaper trip for me. \\n\\nLoads of whining and food bribes later, he accepted with the condition that I go to every event with him to keep him company. \\n\\n...and then I realised the conference was happening too soon for me to get a visa. I’m Indonesian, and Indonesia’s not only a 3rd world country, it’s the world’s largest Muslim country....which means I’m always fucked traveling-wise and need a month to apply for visas to travel to most places. \\n\\nSo yeah. My husband is now on a flight to Korea, alone and miserable. \\n\\n**TL;DR:** sent my husband on a trip he didn’t want to go to so I can tag along. And I can’t make it. \\n\\n**UPDATE:** My husband’s [reaction](https://imgur.com/a/6XHY0) when I told him another redditor is attending the same conference & offered to hang out with him.  I live in a tall household.  I\\'m a 5\\'11\" lady and my housemates are 6\\'1\" and 6\\'5\" respectively.  We can reach high things.\\n\\nWe got a cat a couple of months ago that we\\'re basically obsessed with. He is not tall (it\\'s not his fault!).\\n\\nA few weeks ago we started cracking the windows because the landlord turned the heat on and it\\'s hot AF. This led to the occasional insect coming inside to chill on our ceiling. It drove the cat nuts.\\n\\nSo we started lifting the cat to the ceiling to \"hunt\" because we love him dearly and because it was funny as shit. Cat is happy, we\\'re amused. The only loser here is the fly that picked the wrong apartment. Wrong.\\n\\nFast forward to today. The cat now considers the ceiling his hunting grounds and will spend an inordinate amount of time staring at the empty ceiling and crying for prey. Can\\'t help ya, bud. Please stop crying?\\n\\nTL:DR I gave my cat a taste of the high life now he\\'s down in the dumps.\\n\\nEdit: punctuation matters.\\n\\nEdit: GOLD! Thank you kind stranger.\\nAlso, [cat tax](https://imgur.com/a/DPEaOts)\\n\\nEdit the third: An awful lot of you have never heard of steam heat. Pre-war buildings tend not to have central air so heat is supplied via steam pipes and radiators using a furnace in the basement.  In especially shitty hipster apartments the radiator is either off or on. Guess what type of apartment I live in. Throwaway account because my dignity.\\n\\nObligatory this happened during midterms in October. I just haven’t had a chance to write about it until now.\\n\\nThis is going to be a long one, but I feel this story requires a certain degree of explanation before reaching the climax (no pun intended).\\n\\nI’m a 26-year-old woman in a rather intensive graduate program. To put it in perspective, grad programs in this field typically take two years to complete, but the one I’m enrolled in is a one-year program. So right of the bat, I’m completing two years’ worth of coursework in one. Secondly, I’m now at a fairly prestigious university after having completed my undergrad at a not-so-great university. I always thought I had high standards for myself, but the expectations at this school are *much* higher than what I’m used to, and I still question all the time whether I’m actually good enough to be here. Thirdly, I’m not so great at handling stress. I am working with a therapist through campus psychological services, but I’m not finding their approach to therapy particularly helpful. And since that’s all I can afford right now with my insurance, that’s the best I can get.\\n\\nBottom line: I’m stressed out all the time. And midterms were *hell*: four hefty papers all due within three days of each other. Now, three of those papers weren’t so bad. They took a while to write, but at least I knew what I was writing. Paper number four, however… Guys, this paper fucked me *hard*. This paper fucked me like I’ve never been fucked in my whole life. And I’m in an English-related field, so believe me, I am *not* used to getting fucked by papers. I won’t bore you with the details, but in a nutshell, the paper required that we read a pool of approximately 30-40 journal articles and write a paper on their characteristics. (To be fair, we had from mid-August to mid-October to complete this assignment, so given the timespan, it *was* doable.) Now, if I were to write a list of all the reasons why this paper threw me off, I’d end up with a dissertation. In the limited space I have, I can’t fully explain why this paper was so hard, so please just believe me when I tell you it was *hard*. Yes, even though I’d spoken to the professor about it a few times. And it was worth about a third of my grade.\\n\\nAnyway, this big bastard was due on a Monday, so I brought myself to the library on Friday, determined (after several failed attempts) to *at least* get an outline done. I tried for about 2.5 hours to draw up a plan to organize this thing, but for the life of me, I *could not* figure out how to cram all the required elements into a cohesive, logical argument, especially given the miniscule word count of the assignment (2,500 words maximum, when this paper *could* have been a fucking book). Now, at this point, it’s not that I was losing willpower or energy. No: the problem was that I was freaking out. I wanted to focus on this paper, but all my brain could do was assault me with a barrage of negative thoughts: *You’re going to fail this paper and fail this class and lose your financial aid and drop out of school and be a huge failure to everyone because you suck…* You get the idea. And then, to make matters worse, my mental distress started to express itself physically; I *wanted* to keep writing, but my hands were shaking so much I could barely even hold my pen. My neck was stiff as a board, my head burned above my eyes, my back was spasming a little, and my heart was pounding like a fucking jackhammer. And then.\\n\\nAnd *then*.\\n\\nI’ve Googled this and haven’t really been able to find a satisfactory explanation for what happened next. But I’ll recount the sensation as I experienced it. All of a sudden, I felt a *massive* rush of blood to my lower body. I can only guess this was some kind of adrenaline-related/fight-or-flight response. My entire bottom half suddenly felt as if it had been electrified: feet, legs… and lady bits. There I was, silently losing my mind in a library full of students studying for midterms, when out of the clear blue sky, my clit feels ready to burst.\\n\\nI came before I even knew what was happening. It wasn’t some screaming, thrashing affair, but I did convulse in my chair and ended up moaning a little out of sheer surprise. And yes, people *definitely* noticed; I was on the quiet-study floor, so the room had been *silent* up until that point. I don’t think I was obvious enough that anyone would conclude I’d just had an orgasm in the library, but still… clearly *something* had happened. I packed my shit, went the hell home, and drank several screwdrivers at 2:00 in the afternoon.\\n\\nAs I said, I haven’t really found a thorough explanation for this (though I haven’t been searching too intensely). I have found the occasional anecdotal account of people having similar experiences. Mostly, though, I’ve been finding articles about how stress and anxiety *inhibit* orgasm in women. For my part in this research, I state for the record that stress can, indeed, spiral so low that is sort of bursts through the other side and expresses itself as sexual ecstasy, whether you like it or not.\\n\\nAlso, I got a 78 on the paper. But my professor assures me it won’t end up tanking my grade.\\n\\nTL;DR: I got so stressed that I came involuntarily in my university library. Also, I may have masochistic tendencies and don’t know who I am anymore.\\n\\nEDIT: Thank you all for your thoughtful responses, as well as for the silver and gold.\\n\\nI\\'d just like to clarify on a couple of points that have been brought up: I did not procrastinate on this assignment. I completed the reading in a timely manner and gave myself plenty of time (more than a week) to write this paper. Given the rigor of this program, that is *all* the time I could give myself to do it. The paper just never quite happened in an orderly, timely fashion because I was so confused and stressed out. Normally I never put off things until the last minute. It just sort of happened this time because I had no idea what I was doing.\\n\\nSecondly, I am working with a therapist on my stress management techniques. I recently told my therapist that I\\'d like to do some more intensive work for managing stress, and she referred me to an off-campus therapist who will accept my insurance. Hopefully, we\\'ll be able to work together to figure out some solutions that work for me. Again, I\\'m very grateful for all the advice and input! I\\'m really glad I could make you guys laugh. You all have made me laugh, as well! So this story happened about a year ago, and requires some cultural context. In Ireland, there’s been a recent resurgence in the Irish language, and a lot of movement to promote Irish speaking throughout the countries. This resulted in an Irish speaking bar being opened in Dublin. \\n\\nI didn’t grow up in Ireland, so I don’t speak a word of Irish- but my best friend was begging me to go with her to this bar. I relented, but told her it was up to her to get me into the bar and order at the bar for us so I didn’t get in trouble for not speaking Irish. She agreed happily and we headed out that night. \\n\\nSo we get to the bar, and she tells me when it’s our turn to speak to the bouncer, just say “dia dhuit”, which means hello, and she’ll chat away to distract him. Our plan goes off without a hitch, and we’re in! I turn, ready to ask my friend to order me a drink, to find her lost in the eyes of a boy she’d met a few nights previously. Not wanting to get in her way, I just gently shook her shoulder, and we have a conversation as follows. \\n\\nMe: “Hey, how do I ask for an Orchard Thieves in Irish?” \\n\\nFriend: “Oh, uh, Orchard Thieves... le do thoil”\\n\\nI nod and leave her to it, and make my way determinedly to the bar. The bar man comes over and says something in Irish I can’t understand, so I panic, and just shout out my order. \\n\\n“Le do thoil!”\\n\\nThe barman returns a blank look. I take this as him not having understood me, and decide I need to be more clear. \\n\\n“LE. DO. THOIL.”\\n\\nThe bar man cocks his head, and says something that I again, don’t understand. Now fully panicking, I decide to just keep repeating myself in different inflections until he gets me. \\n\\n“Le DO Thoil? LE Do Thoil? Le Do THOIL?”\\n\\nEventually the barman interrupts me. \\n\\n“Jesus Christ girl just speak English. What do you want?!” \\n\\n“Just an Orchard Thieves!”\\n\\nThe bar man walks away, muttering, “Why didn’t you just say so?” \\n\\nEmbarrassed my friend had put me in this position, I marched up to her and yanked her off the boy who she’d been chatting up. \\n\\n“What did you tell me to say?” I demand. \\n\\n“Huh? I told you how to say Orchard Thieves please?”\\n\\n“Yeah well, clearly the way you say it is wrong, because the barman had no idea what I was saying.”\\n\\nMy friend looks at me suspiciously. “Pzych, what did you say, exactly?”\\n\\n“I said le do thoil. And I said it a bunch of ways as well, so there’s no way I got the pronunciation wrong.”\\n\\n“Wait,” my friend responds. “You said JUST le do thoil?”\\n\\n“Yeah!” I replied, indignant. “That’s what you told me to say!”\\n\\n“No, I told you to say Orchard Thieves le do thoil! Le do thoil means please you eejit!”\\n\\nAnd then it dawned on me. Of course you don’t translate Orchard Thieves- it’s a brand name! So that meant that I was just repeating, in varying tones and levels of panic, “please please please” to this poor bar tender. \\n\\nI am, indeed, an eejit. \\n\\nTL;DR: I misunderstood how to ask for a drink in Irish, and ended up just repeating “please” to the poor bartender with varying levels of panic.\\n\\nEdit: for all those people trying to correct me to say it’s meant to be [Gaelic](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.unitedlanguagegroup.com/blog/gaelic-vs-irish-whats-the-difference%3Fhs_amp%3Dtrue) I(M) invited my girlfriend to my house today. How could it go wrong? Parents caught us having sex? Parents caught us in the middle of something that looks extremely awkward from the outside, like a weird game? No, god no. If a god is out there, clearly I haven\\'t prayed enough because holy fuck. The things I\\'d do to take this back.\\n\\nTo preface this, me and my mom are quite close. We talk a lot about topics most people can\\'t with their parents from masturbation to marriage issues. My girlfriend knows I\\'m quite open about a lot of stuff, like the fact that I watch hentai and jerk off almost excessively. Yes, you can reach this level of openness with your parents. I\\'m not anywhere near as close with my dad, but my mom (and some younger siblings, who cares) was the only person home at the time. What my girlfriend didnt know is that me and my mom do not under any circumstances discuss our kinks or fetishes. My girlfriend did however know I like to crossdress(among some other stuff.)\\n\\nSo my mom picks us up, gf and mom meet eachother and talk about some stuff. They\\'re just casually chatting and then my mom makes a joke about me having panties in my drawer. I shrug it off with some comments about how I do you know, adding to the joke. We are laughing then my girlfriend starts saying \"Well uhm yeah you know how he um... yeah does that and stuff\" and variations of it for what felt like the longest 5 or so seconds of my life. I would love to see the look on my face as she basically told my OWN MOTHER that I crossdress for sexual pleasure. She didn\\'t explicitly say, but it was heavily implied by context, and the fact that I instantly started panicking, the look on my face and body language would have given it away. My mom is a smart person, and she definitely would\\'ve known.\\n\\nTLDR; Invited gf to house, she told my mom I wear panties sometimes. This happened to me a week ago but I was just too embarrassed that every time I thought about it, I would get sick in my stomach. \\n\\nSo for starters, I’m not a good singer AT ALL, I’m the kind of person that gets last place at karaoke games every single time. I do love singing tho, especially when I think I’m alone. \\n\\nCurrently I am staying in Croatia and there’s a small town nearby with a tiny tiny church. Me and my girlfriend went inside and there were amazing acoustics inside. (The type where you can sing great operas or horror movie soundtracks) \\n\\nI decided to firstly sing the Halo theme song and it sounded great. \\n\\nWe went outside and decided to grab a drink before leaving the town, but on our way out we walked past the church again. I begged me gf to go inside again so I could sing a song from the Hobbit (misty mountains) and decided to record it. My girlfriend was embarrassed and decided to stay outside whilst I sang at almost the loudest I could and I think it sounded amazing. (I haven’t listened to the recording because I’m too scared to). \\n\\nAfter I finished the song I went outside of the door and at that moment I noticed that the church was across the street from a restaurant. A restaurant filled with probably 50/60 tourists just STARING at me. \\n\\nAll. Of. Them. \\n\\nMy girlfriend was standing around the corner with the biggest grin ever saying that a lot of people were recording and laughing at it. \\n\\nMe being a person with incredible anxiety issues (yay for therapy) decided that the best option was to just... run away. Not looking back a single time. \\n\\nIt was probably the most embarrassing moment of my life and it gives me shivers everytime I think back. \\n\\nTL;DR found a church with amazing acoustics where I decided to sing a song from the Hobbit, but accidentally sang for a lot of people that were across the street.\\n\\nEdit: [here’s the video of me singing](https://streamable.com/7cg7di) TL;DR at bottom\\n\\nThis story begins three days ago and concluded yesterday morning.\\n\\nThis is the most exciting shit that has happened to me in weeks, people. \\n\\nI have, despite loving the outdoors, never been stung by a wasp, bee, etc. I have no problems with insects, hell I’ll pick up a spider, but the pointy asses I’m not a fan of (bees are cool though). \\n\\nSo I wake up and head to the bathroom to take my morning shit, I open the door and hear buzzing and notice Satan himself has decided to pay me a visit and is flying about my shower curtains. \\n\\nI immediately noped out of there and begin brainstorming how to kill this bastard. \\n\\nI had determined that the point of entry was my window as it was slightly ajar, I seal the weak point and prepare to suit up. \\n\\nI then spend the next 20 minutes putting on multiple layers of clothing, 2 pairs of socks going on top of my pants, 2 sweatshirts, sweatpants, a shirt around my head and face “turban” style, a beanie, winter gloves...you get the point. I was impenetrable save the slit where my eyes were. I grab “The Executioner” which is a glorified electric tennis racket and was ready for war. \\n\\nI slowly open the door to do some recon and see that little jerk was chilling on the ceiling vent. Close the door, grab The Executioner, take a deep breath and reopen the door. \\n\\nThe enemy has since taken up a more tactical position behind the lights above my sink...clever. It turns to face me and opens its wings up, ready to kamikaze my ass at a moment’s notice. It can smell fear, and probably the gallons of sweat I’m excreting from being in enough clothing to brave Mt. Everest. I’m fucking hot and shaking. \\n\\nThinking on the fly (hah puns) I grab a shirt and throw it at the winged heathen to try and flush it out of it’s position- success! Or so I thought. \\n\\nIt tumbled down for a moment before regaining control and I shit you not made a beeline (more puns) straight for me and in a panic I slam the door shut. My mom is telling me I need to close the vent in my bathroom otherwise It could get in and then the whole household would be compromised. \\n\\nUnderstanding the stakes I muster the courage to open the door one more time only to discover that in my haste I have lost all visual of the enemy. Gone. After closing the vent I spent the next 10 minutes, still sweating balls, clearing the bathoom looking for that little shit. Couldn’t find it. I was convinced that it made it’s way into the ventilation. \\n\\nAll hands on deck. Code red. I close every vent on the second floor in every room and the vents in the hallway. I meticulously check my bathoom once again, under the sink, between the shower curtains, trash can, nothing. There’s nothing more I can do.\\n\\nI spend the next two days afraid of my own fucking bathroom, carrying The Executioner with me like Jesse Pinkman and his pistol in El Camino. It must be in the vents, and so there it shall die.\\n\\nI awake yesterday morning to take my morning shit, the first time that I didn’t take The Executioner with me and when I exit to go lie down in bed again I’m greeted with a familiar sound emanating from the window blinds next to my bed. Then I see it. \\n\\nThat skinny waisted, stabby assed, flying fucker flew under the radar and remained in hiding for TWO DAYS until I was UNARMED and then makes a move. It was in my room. Skulking. Lurking. Waiting. I see it fly behind my bed. The Executioner is on my nightstand. I’m without armor and in nothing but briefs. \\n\\nOn some wild west cowboy shit ready to draw, I make a move for The Executioner and backpedal to a central position where I can wait for it’s next move. Mano y mano, bitch. \\n\\nI wait 5 minutes before deciding that I’ve had enough. I flank around the perimeter of my room and with one hand open up my window nice and wide, hoping and praying that I didn’t just invite the whole wasp cavalry to make a grand entrance into my bedroom if it decides to release attack pheremones. \\n\\nIt must’ve been behind my nightstand and felt threatened by my arm because it flew out and landed right on my forearm and before I could swipe it off and electrify that flying syringe it delivered me a painful parting gift. I freak out and trip backwards before it flew off out of my window.\\n\\nWindow shut. I lick my wounds. The vents are opened. The war is over, but casualties have been sustained. Honestly, that little asshole deserves to live, so long as it never returns. \\n\\nTL; DR A wasp spawns in my bathroom. I failed at killing it. It disappears and remains hidden for two days before reemerging. It takes my sting virginity and escapes and I definitely didn’t pussy out\\n\\nEDIT: FUCK YOU WASP I GOT PLATINUM! A couple pics of the possible yellow jacket nest we now gotta deal with, plus my “armor” and the heathen himself: https://imgur.com/gallery/exXFOhK\\n\\nEdit 2: The culprit was a single paper wasp. The nest in the first picture is a possible yellow jacket nest, entirely separate, like some fucked up level 2 on the horizon after surviving level 1. This happened earlier today.\\n\\nMy partner and I stopped in at a pet store to buy food and litter for our cats. This pet store is part of a chain that works with rescue agencies in our area. Each location has an \\'adoption centre\\' where cats who are deemed ready for adoption are kept.\\n\\nAnother detail: My partner has a sister whose name we shorten to \"Kat\". Kat has long volunteered for one of our local rescue agencies to foster cats, which are then brought to the various locations of the pet store chain in question. So we\\'ll stop by the adoption centre to look at the kitties, and sometimes they look familiar. That\\'s right: sometimes we see Kat\\'s cats in the adoption centre. Of course, she takes care of so many at any given time that it\\'s hard for me to keep track. But when I recognize one, I get pretty excited to see them ready to find humans of their very own.\\n\\nBack to today: The pet store location we\\'re at has the adoption centre nearer to the front of the store than most other locations, and so I went to look at the cats while my partner stood in line nearby. Then I see them. Two sister kittens who are eerily familiar; I remember one of them because of her name, and the other one because she looks like a younger version of one of our guys. I look up at my partner, and I ask VERY loudly:\\n\\n\"Are these Kat\\'s? I think these are Kat\\'s!\"\\n\\nI look at him, and he\\'s just staring at me with a very concerned look on his face. Confused, I continued, a little louder:\\n\\n\"Seriously, I think these ones are Kat\\'s!\"\\n\\nAfter a pause, a look of understanding comes to his eyes, and he just shakes his head. I then look at the other people in the line, who are also staring at me. Then I realized that, without the necessary context, it looked like a 30-something year-old guy who wasn\\'t entirely sure what cats looked like, and that I was excited to maybe be able to identify them. \\n\\nI return to the line up and just silently wish for death. When we make it out of the store, my partner tells me that even he wasn\\'t sure what I was talking about at first, and was wondering if he should bring me to a hospital, before he understood what I was trying to say.\\n\\nTL;DR: I stood pointing at cats in a busy pet store, asking my partner if they were cats. Many strangers looked on in confusion.\\n\\nUpdate: Can now confirm, they were definitely Kat\\'s. Also, a big thank you for the awards. I\\'ve never gotten any before! Even though this happened over a decade ago, my family still occasionally roasts me for it.\\n\\nBack when I was around 9 or 10 my family bought me [these toys for Christmas](https://m.imgur.com/a/AD358JS). As the pictures suggests, you could “connect” a figure\\'s fists to anothers via the magnets on the fists themselves - which happened to be **really** strong.\\n\\nYou can probably see where this is going already... In my not-so-clever mind I wanted to see if I could connect the wrestlers to my foreskin. I remember stretching my foreskin with one hand whilst also holding one of the wrestlers fists against the stretched skin. Then with my other hand I grabbed the other wrestler and slowly brought its fist closer to the foreskin where the other fist was sitting on the other side. **SNAP** I fell over and screamed in agonising pain, as not only were Hulk Hogan and Goldberg stuck to my foreskin - they were pinching the end like a snapping turtle. \\n\\nHulk and Goldberg held their grip while I screamed in pain. I tried pulling them apart but due to the pain or panick I just couldn\\'t.\\n\\nTo my absolute embarrassment, my Mum and Dad rushed into the room and had to pull Hulk and Goldberg from my dick.\\n\\nThis story is still brought up at Christmas dinners to this day.\\n\\nTL;DR: Got Hulk Hogan and Goldberg action figures stuck to my dick via magnets and had to get my parents to remove them. Today I learned that Venmo takes the subject of your payment very seriously. \\n\\nEvery month when the power bill comes up, my roommate alerts us of in a comical manner. We\\'ve received the Star Wars title scrawl with the text reworded to describe the bill, the Stranger Things intro sequence, you get the idea. Well this time I get a link to a subtitled North Korean news broadcast, link [here.](http://www.captiongenerator.com/731812/NORTH-KOREA-POWER-BILL) So naturally I send my roommate the money via Venmo with the subject \"North Korea is best Korea.\"\\n\\nWithin seconds, I get a notification in the Venmo app that my payment has been halted pending review by Venmo\\'s compliance department per Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) guidelines. There is a 48hr hold on the payment and I\\'m required to submit a statement of sorts explaining my payment. It\\'s been about an hour and I\\'ve already had a phone call with the customer service department that can be summed up as \"Can you not??\" \\n\\nIt would seem that [there is a list](http://gawker.com/the-words-that-will-get-you-in-trouble-on-venmo-1738331672) of words that will get you into trouble on Venmo, but all the usual jokes about cocaine and hookers are good-to-go. It\\'s been a fun morning.\\n\\nTL;DR: Paid power bill with subject \"North Korea is best Korea.\" Got flagged per Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) guidelines. Still haven\\'t been able to pay the power bill...\\n\\nEdit: Here\\'s the Stranger Things one he did for us last month: Removed as it had our actual names on it\\n\\nEdit #2: And the Star Wars one: https://brorlandi.github.io/StarWarsIntroCreator/#!/AKrfBcVlS4JDf-QEeKBw\\n\\nEdit #3: Despite all this annoyance, Venmo is still really useful and I\\'d recommend it. Just avoid funding rogue states and terrorists while you pay for mundane items. It\\'s hard, but I\\'m sure you can manage. \\n\\nEdit #4: They let the payment go through. At least their CS dept is pretty quick on these things. I hope that video made someone\\'s day at Venmo. Now back to funding rogue states and terrorist groups. My monthly payments to the KGB and ISIS are late...\\n\\nEdit #5: Removed Stranger Things link due to personal info issues.\\n\\nEdit #6: Looks like the link to the vid in question is currently kill. Not sure if hug o\\' death or what. Meh, just keep F5\\'ing. What could go wrong?\\n\\n**Edit #7: Link is no longer kill. Be gentle.**\\n\\nEdit #7: Obligatory \"Thanks for the gold kind stranger\" or whatever edit.\\n\\nEdit #8: [Proof for the doubters.](https://imgur.com/DQuGYwr)\\n\\nEdit #9: No mirror for the link available. My roommate whipped it up at his office and we don\\'t have a local copy of it. Hopefully the reddit hug ends soon enough for people to be able to view it. Sorry :( This happened yesterday and also english is not my first language so apologize if there are any grammatical error. Info I [21M] and my cousin [24F]\\n\\nI know this is the most cliche story but whatever I just wanna share. I was staying with my aunt for a week as a mini break because my class has already ended and i just need to finish a final project for my grade. Me being horny af because of exams and such these past month haven\\'t had the time to properly relax and releive myself which leads to rock hard morning wood every morning. \\n\\nThat day I woke up but haven\\'t fully regained my consciousness so I was still half asleep. I  had a huge urge to pee and I said to myself \"fuck better take care of this or I\\'m gonna have self-induced golden shower.\" I got out of bed and hurried to the bathroom. When I wss really near the bathroom I had this bright idea to pull my pants waistband down and let it spring into action, for efficiency sake so I could go back to sleep asap. I barged right in and there she was, my cousin, fully naked both hands on her hair and me boner in hand. She was surprised as she has that deer in headlight looks on her and so did I. Now this is where I fucked up. We both froze, and we just looked at each other, scanning each other. As I was still half-asleep I thought to myself \"fuck she is hot!\". Until I snapped back to reality and realized it is her that all this time I was looking at. I pulled my pants up and immediately closed the door all in one smooth move as I said sorry multiple times. I ran back to my room in panic as I try to compose myself. When I\\'m back to my senses I forgot that I had to pee so I used the other bathroom (the bathroom that this incident happened was closer so I used that one) and went back to my room.\\n\\nI\\'m fucked and I\\'m just glad that we both just froze and she didn\\'t scream or something as it might\\'ve caused a scene. A bit of background my family is conservative, and this is especially true for my aunt family\\'s and my cousin in particular. And I never thought of her other than a cousin. She is just a very kind, wholesome and fun person so we hang out a lot. And now I don\\'t think I could look her in the eye. Fuck I feel so guilty.\\n\\nThis kind of thing has never happened to me before. I mean I have barged into my mom and my distant cousin in the past but it was nothing in my opinion as I always immediately apologize and close the door. The thing is I could remember that incident with her crystal clear, like every detail. God I\\'m so fucked.\\n\\nI haven\\'t met her since but my aunt has planned dinner for all of us tomorrow so its only a matter of time\\n\\nEdit 1: both bathrooms have locks on them and I have checked the one where it happened that it was functioning properly.\\n\\nEdit 2: words and formatting\\n\\nTL;DR Hurried to the bathroom half-asleep boner in hand to find my cousin fully nude and we scanned each other like xerox as her nude is imprinted in my consciousness.\\n\\nMini Update: \\nSo this morning she went to the room I\\'m using to let me know that breakfast is ready which to my head feels unusual. I went to the kitchen area get my food and sat with her in living room watching tv. As I ate I noticed something is different with her, she wasn\\'t upset or anything but her vibe has changed. I don\\'t know how to describe it tbh. We chatted a bit and I tried to come up with as many random topic as possible because I didn\\'t want her to discuss what happened as my aunt is still in the kitchen area which is right next to the living room so she could hear everything. Finished my meal asap and excused myself back to my room. Throughout the day up to this point as I\\'m writing this she seems to kinda noticed me whenever I\\'m around. I don\\'t know whether it was real or it was just in my mind. \\n\\nI haven\\'t had any proper talk about it with her. Yes, we usually lock the doors. Yes, I rarely knock. Objectively speaking yes she is insanely hot, like she has the ratio to summarize. I don\\'t think I\\'m gonna go forward with this and I\\'m definitely don\\'t wanna get kicked out just because of this. I plan to talk to her tonight after dinner.\\n\\nUpdate: \\nDinner went well I think. My aunt is also normal so I assume she hasn\\'t talked to her about the incident. We generally just talked about the protest, covid and stuff so there aren\\'t anything worth of mention. I did noticed throughout dinner the way she looked at me was.. attentive, like she was looking at me more than usual. I can\\'t confirm really as I was more focused on the foods because it was so good. \\n\\nAnyway dinner was done and I planned on going to her room afterwards when she is by herself. I must say I was really nervous at this point. I went there and her door was open and I could see that she was drawing something (her hobby is drawing so it is normal). I asked her that I wanted to talk about something. She said \"Sure\" while gestured to sit right next to her. For additional context in her room there is also a couch, a medium size one for like 2 people. I sat there and she was still fixated on her thing. I then apologized for what happened while stammering a bit because I was still nervous. When I was done, she stopped drawing and I looked at her face and she was blushing, I guess. I don\\'t know really but I think there was a bit redness on her face. She just said \"Oh, okay\". Dead silence. I guess I must\\'ve zoned out beacause I expected more response from her and I was like \"That\\'s it? Really?\". When I snapped back I asked her what did she draw this time to shift the topic because the situation was really awkward. It was about herself and proceed to make jokes(SFW) about it to break the ice. We both laughed for quite sometime as I try my damndest to lighten up the mood. After the mood is back to normal and we were done laughing I said to her that I have to do something. \\n\\nNow this the part that gets me. She then leans in and gave me a hug which really suprised me as she has never done it to me before. So I hugged back as I thought it would be rude to leave her hanging. It wasn\\'t a tight hug I think just a normal hug. When were done she said \"I knew you\\'d feel the same\" with a big smile on her face. I have no idea what she was referring to as my mind was still surprised. So I blurted out \"Of course I would\" In which I then immediately excused myself and we said goodnight to each other. \\n\\nTo this point of writing I still can\\'t figure out what we were talking about because there was so much thought in my head that I wasn\\'t really focused on the conversation itself. Tbh I don\\'t think I wanna know what she was talking about. I just hope that was just some random shit and it was enough of an explanation and everything is clear so I can get this over with.\\n\\nFinal Update: Since some people requested an update. I left this morning and as I\\'m writing this I\\'m already back at my place. I tried not to think much about what happened as I didn\\'t want to open a chapter in my life with this direction. I also didn\\'t have anymore serious talk with her. The only thing of interest is that we spent yesterday watching the entire season of Netflix\\'s The Witcher. I suggested it to her because I\\'m huge witcher fan and she hasn\\'t seent it either and really intrigued in it. We already planned this way before the incident so there is nothing weird about it. We watched together on this couch-ish-bed thingy but I was too focused on The Witcher so I barely pay any attention on how she was with me. As I said I played all this safely because I didn\\'t want to jeopardize my relationship with her. I also blocked all kind of thoughts of her in that direction, iykwim. That was it tbh. a few months ago I was lying in bed about to fall asleep, when I start to hear a noise that seems to come from upstairs.\\n\\nthe noise was like a bouncing ball falling. the ball began to fall from very high and the noise intensified as it began to approach the ground. then stop. and would come back again.\\n\\nthe sound was soft but very close.\\n\\nI am someone who sleeps anywhere, anytime, in any position. I\\'m like chuck norris falling asleep but this was crazy. a sleep deprivation torture.\\n\\nthe sound continued for another 30 minutes and stopped. there were days when it kept going for an hour straight. days when nothing just happened. sometimes I heard it during the day which was almost equally horrible because I couldn\\'t concentrate if I was reading or watching a movie. but he appeared mostly at bedtime.\\n\\nthis went on for over a month.\\n\\none night I was very tired and decided to go to bed early (9pm).\\n\\nand of course there was that motherfucker again.\\n\\nI did not think. I got out of bed, opened the apartment door and climbed the stairs to my upstairs neighbors.\\n\\nso there I was. no bra. wearing a t-shirt with prehistoric spots. some pants with three sizes over mine. and with the classic trousers inside the socks for extra heat. with hair where any bird would proudly wear as a nest. and of course knee socks of different colors and sizes because everyone has a black hole sucking socks inside the washing machine. at this point in my decaying life, I didn\\'t even bother to put my shoes on.\\n\\nso there I was, climbing the stairs with nothing planned to say.\\n\\nas I approached the door I could hear a lot of noise in their house. I ring the bell and a girl opens the door. everyone in that house came to see what was going on. they were all very well dressed, as if they had come from a wedding or something and visibly lightly drunk.\\n\\nso there I was in the hallway explaining to a group of fancy drunk people that there is a noise \"like a falling bouncing ball\" coming from that apartment.\\n\\nshe tells me she has housemates but the room above mine is empty.\\n\\nI still say that it is impossible. that the noise comes almost every day and it\\'s been a month and I\\'m starting to go crazy.\\n\\nshe says she doesn\\'t know where the noise might come from. There is nothing at home that can make a sound that I tried to mimic.\\n\\nyes, I imitated a bouncy ball with different voices for a group of fancy drunk people.\\n\\nso there I was, thinking as we talked that none of this was going to get resolved and most likely would have to move house until I say, without much thought, \"wanna go see it?\"\\n\\nso there we were, me and 8 other fancy drunk people in my small room quietly waiting for the noise to appear.\\n\\nand of course, nothing happened.\\n\\nI apologized to everyone, I took the fancy drunk people to the door and went to bed to spoon with my shame and retardness.\\n\\nthis was last week.\\n\\ntoday a friend came here for the afternoon. while we were talking the wild noise appeared. I was hysterical.\\n\\n\"ARE YOU HEARING THIS\"\\n\\n\"yea...\"\\n\\n\"I can no longer with this noise, I think I\\'ll have to move house.\"\\n\\n\"it comes from your warmer ...\"\\n\\nso my heater has two buttons. one to turn it on and one to change the temperature. and it seems that when the heater is off and the temperature button is in heat mode, it makes a weird noise that looks like a bouncing ball and the echo of the house sounds like it comes from upstairs.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\ntl;dr: I\\'m retarded. Okay it was Friday, not today, but close enough.\\n\\nI had a vasectomy last Tuesday, and my doctor told me to wait a week at least before masturbating/having sex. As someone who has a high sex drive, this was a tall order, and despite the incredible bruising and pain of the first two days, I found myself absurdly horny. My wife enjoyed my pain immeasurably and teased me a lot my whipping out her boobs regularly, knowing I was powerless to do anything about it.\\n\\nSo Friday morning, things were still a bit tender, but I had decided that the surgeon clearly didn\\'t know anything and that the Internet, which said \"whenever you feel up to it\" was a more reliable source of info. That morning while my wife was taking our daughter to school I decided to take my dick and balls for a test ride.\\n\\nEverything was going really well, and I\\'d gotten all set up at my wife\\'s desk and was making it a really special wank (just the right video selection, lube etc), and just as I came, everything started to go wrong.\\n\\nFirstly, a week\\'s worth of jizz, some weird clear liquid and a little blood from my op came gushing forth, overwhelming my poorly prepared fold of toilet paper  that normally suffices, spilling everywhere, including into my wife\\'s net fabric chair cushions. Simultaneously, my balls start to ache like hell.\\n\\nBy the afternoon my balls had swollen up and every time I stood up it was like someone was pulling strings attached to rusty knives somewhere in my crotch, and my balls generally felt like they\\'d had a good kicking. This persisted for about 5 days, and now on Thursday they are just about back to normal.\\n\\n\\nTl;Dr, jerked off before the doctor said I should after a vasectomy, jizzed cum and blood everywhere and made my balls hurt like hell for nearly a week. Listen to your surgeon/doctor!\\n\\nEdit: to answer the most common questions - \\n\\nmy wife thought I was an idiot, but is a lovely woman and was mostly concerned for my nuts\\' wellbeing... But only because she doesn\\'t know about the chair.\\n\\nThe chair, and my balls, are all fine now. \\n\\nYes I\\'m gross, I know. \\n\\nI love Cannibal Corpse, and yes I\\'m aware of the song.\\n\\nThank you everyone for sharing your vasectomy stories, many of which had me in stitches (no I didn\\'t have stitches before you crack a joke about that) Obligatory this didn\\'t happen today, but I was talking to my friend and remembered about this whole ordeal and thought I\\'d share.\\n\\nThis happened a few months ago, and for context, me and my friend are both 17 and female, and importantly one of our female friends had just come out as gay at the time. This meant that my other friend (the one who this is about, who I\\'ll call H) had told her parents that one of her female friends was gay, but hadn\\'t specified which one (important later).\\n\\nSo one day H invited me over to watch a film after school. When I arrived I said hi to her parents then went upstairs with H to her bedroom to watch the film. This is where the fuck up slowly started. First of all we closed the door, which is something that we never do when I visit her, but was important as we were watching a film and didn\\'t want to be disturbed by her parents. Then we turned the light out, again, uncharacteristic for us but important for watching a film. We really didn\\'t think much about either of these things.\\n\\nAnyway, an hour later we were talking and laughing with the film in the background. Now this is where I really fucked up, I was being uncharacteristically funny and was talking in a kinda flirty, sexual voice which one of the characters in the film had sounded like. H found this really funny so I continued with it and only spoke with that voice for a good 10 minutes or so, and we were both quietly laughing a lot. At some point during this time I heard her parents walk past the door but neither of us though much about it. Some more important information to know is that H is asexual (meaning that she doesn\\'t experience sexual attraction and doesn\\'t want to have sex), and her parents don\\'t know this about her because she doesn\\'t like to talk to them about that kind of thing. This means that I constantly forget that most people don\\'t know this about her.\\n\\nAnother 20 mins past and then we heard footsteps and soft knocking on the door. We thought this was strange as they\\'re the kind of parents to barge into a room without announcing their presence. H shouted at them to just come in the room and then we heard the sliding of paper under the door. We were very confused and just watched this piece of paper awkwardly sliding and then heard footsteps walking away. H picked up the paper and it said \"we\\'re going to get McDonalds for dinner do you want anything?\".\\n\\nWe were both seriously confused about why they had felt the need to tell us via paper, in such an awkward way rather than just opening the door to ask. Then it dawned on me and I turned to H and asked her \"Do your parents think we were fucking?\", at first she looked at me with a look of confused disgust, wondering why the hell I had said that, then slowly her expression turned to that of horror and realisation. We had closed to door, turned of the lights, had been quietly giggling, I had been talking in a flirty voice for an extended period of time... Not to mention the fact that neither one of us can sit still for more than 10 seconds so there had certainly been lots of bed creaking and sheet rustling sounds. Also her parents knew that one of her two female friends was gay just didn\\'t know which one it was, and didn\\'t know that their daughter was asexual so would never want to have sex anyway.\\n\\nWe immediately turned the lights on and opened the door, but by then it was too late. When we went downstairs to say what we wanted from McDonald\\'s her parents couldn\\'t look either one of us in the eye, and were talking to us really awkwardly. After the McDonalds I left and H spent a lot of time subtly clearing it up with her parents, such as mentioning the name of the friend who was gay, and bringing up that I had a boyfriend (which her parents didn\\'t know about). I think they realised that they had got it wrong but those moments of awkwardness were horrific. Luckily all has been fine since, but now whenever we meet up we make sure to keep the door open.\\n\\nTL;DR Went round to a female friend\\'s house to watch a film, we did a series of uncharacteristic stuff that led her parents to believe that we were having sex... Now when we meet up we keep her bedroom door open. So this happened last night. My girlfriend and I have been trying to have a threesome for a while now but could never really find the right girl. Yesterday she reconnected with one of her old middle school friend and they were hanging out at the mall. She called me and asked if they could come by my place after for some drinks and I agreed.\\n\\nThey come over around 9pm and my girlfriend gave me that look. I knew that she talked to her about having a threesome with us and the girl agreed to it. So I play some music and bring out some drinks. Everything is going good until she brings out her own stash of alcohol and weed.\\n\\nThe girl brought two 4Locos and starts chugging. (For those who don\\'t know 4Locos is this really harsh alcoholic drink that\\'s 4 servings of alcohol in one can that can really fuck you up.) She has two of them. Then she rolls a blunt and smokes it. (I didn\\'t drink or smoke at all) By that time my girlfriend is tipsy from the Hennessy I have and starts making out with me. The girl is on the bed watching and obviously starts getting turned on. But a few minutes later she told us she\\'s really tired and wants to go back home. I\\'m bummed out but we all get in the car and I drive her home.\\n\\nI\\'m driving her home down these dark back roads. The whole time she\\'s telling us how she loves having us as friends and that she\\'s sorry for being so tired and all that. Then she starts gagging and making pre vomit sounds I guess? Anyways I pull over to the side of the road so she can do her business. She gets out and starts sprinting down the road (Rip Me) I start chasing her down the the dark road and I catch up. She looks me dead in the face and asked me who I was. I told her I\\'m her friend and that she\\'s not feeling well and my girlfriend and I was taking her home. She\\'s says ok but continues to walk away and a car goes by. She waves her arms and screams for help and I grab  her saying wtf are you doing? Then she bites the shit out my hand. I let go and she runs into the street. I\\'m a black guy with dreads and she\\'s a skinny white girlfriend so the sight of me chasing her is pretty comical. She managed to flag down a truck, a man and wife, and begs them for help. My girlfriend pulled up and very calmly told her friend to get back in the car. The girl screamed get away from me hides in the bush. The couple calls the police. The police showed up and asked everyone questions and took the girl back to her parents place.\\n\\nNo sex was had but instead I got a few cuts from the bite so that\\'s kinda kinky I guess.\\n\\nTl:dr- Girlfriend comes over with her friend for a threesome. Friend gets drunk and high instead and runs away. Friend freaks out and bites my hand and strangers calls the police. Police takes her home\\n\\nUpdate- I\\'m going to go to the clinic soon to have it checked and I\\'m going to try and upload pictures as well. My girl friend tried to get in contact with the girl but no response. We\\'ll stop by her apartment along the way\\n\\nUpdate 2- [Here\\'s my hand](https://imgur.com/a/V6pw3Gc) \\n\\nEdit- I\\'M LIGHT SKINNED BLACK LIKE CARAMEL OR PEANUT BUTTER Lmao\\n\\nEdit 2- EVERYONE IS TELLING ME IM NOT BLACK HELL I DONT KNOW ANYMORE YOU TELL ME \\nhttps://imgur.com/a/g5w76yT I used to deliver pizza.  It was actually the most fun job I have ever had.  I am usually really good with people...but...\\n\\nI delivered pizza to a house like I have done a million times.  As I walk up to the door, all I can smell is pot, and can hear loud music.  I figured it was a party.  I knock, and there was no answer.  I knock louder.  This massive dude with hair down to his ass answers and yells at me for knocking too loud.  I apologized, and went on my way.\\n\\nNext weekend, I see the same address come up, but unit \"B\" (it was a 4 plex type thing).  I walk down the concrete steps to unit \"B\", and knock on the door.  This tall bald dude answers.  I ask him if he knows the guy upstairs, and told him the asshole upstairs yelled at me for knocking too loud.  He looks at me puzzled, and says \"I know, that was me, I bought this 4 plex\".  The dude shaved his head.  From hair to his ass, to bald.  I didn\\'t recognize him at all.  I instantly died on the inside.  I apologized and went on my way.\\n\\nNext weekend...same address.  Remember those concrete steps I mentioned?  When I walked down them, the loop on my pizza bag got hooked on his mail box that was hung on the fence.   It ripped the mail box clear off the fence, and flung it down the stairs.  It actually bounced off his door when it landed.  He opened the door to see me looking like a deer in headlights, frantically pointing at his mailbox (which was bent and twisted now) and trying to explain that I really didn\\'t mean to do it.  I gtfo as quick as I could.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nNext weekend...oh no....same address.  I delivered his pizza successfully this time.  After he paid I nervously said \"Hey, I didn\\'t even insult you or wreck your property this time\".  He laughed, said \"good job\" and handed me a $5 tip.  That was the last time I ever saw that dude.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR am the worst pizza delivery guy ever. So this just happened last night. I should start by saying I have two wonderful, loving big dogs, a GSD and a lab mix. Usually when my fiancé and I start getting ready to rock and roll we lock them out of the bedroom to avoid any distractions. \\n\\nLast night however he woke me up around 1am to have a little midnight fun (he must’ve been having a good dream). I was about it, we started in, and let the good times roll. It was all going per usual, he was done, I was making my steady climb up the hill to heaven. My eyes were closed and I was not being very quiet. Right as I was about to start my journey back down to earth I feel a long wet tongue on my face. Open my eyes, my GSD is standing in my face looking worried and trying to kiss me. \\n\\nLet me tell you, there is no quicker turn off and end to a climax then getting kissed in the mouth by your slobbery dog. I pushed my dog away and my fiancé just burst into tears from laughing so hard. \\n\\nTL;DR we started having sex in the middle of the night, forgot about the dogs. My GSD snuck up and mouth kissed me at my climax and ruined my night. \\n\\nEdit: I can’t believe the most popular Reddit post I will ever have is about this... thank you strangers for silver and platinum! Also thank you to everyone who shares these experiences and so sorry to those who have gotten tongues to the butt... you win? \\n\\nEdit 2: GSD (German Shepard dog) for those of you angry about this, thank you for commenting and bringing my karma up even higher. Also for those of you confused about the whole process, just because my fiancé was finished doesn’t mean he didn’t help a girl out.  Quick statement, This isn\\'t my account, but u/TheGemScout is a close friend of mine and since I don\\'t use reddit I figure someone should get the karma, if you guys happen to enjoy my pain. (Also, this was about a week ago, not today sadly)\\n\\nSo lets preface this. There\\'s an episode of Two & a Half Men where Jake melts a jar of peanut butter into liquid, then He offers Charlie some. \\n\\nSo I\\'m at my friend\\'s house, let\\'s call the friend Mason, and we\\'re watching reruns of the show. We see that fateful scene and Mason thinks it\\'d be a good idea to dare me to drink peanut butter. \\n\\nTwo things before we proceed:\\n\\n1. Our dares are intense, but we never refuse them.\\n\\n2. While it\\'s apparently weird, I despise peanut butter, not that I\\'m allergic or anything, but I really hate the stuff.\\n\\nKnowing that refusing the dare is not an option (or else I\\'m going to get pranked to no end over it) I decide we should just get it over with now.\\n\\nSo my friend hands me the tallest coffee  mug he owns and says \"get to scooping\" while he laughs in my face\\n\\nOnce He\\'s made me fill the cup with peanut butter, he puts in in the microwave for like 1:30 seconds and then motions for me to get the cup before it hardens. Here\\'s where my fuckup begins:\\n\\nI drink coffee often, so I\\'m not very careful about it being hot, and assume it\\'s much MUCH cooler than my typical coffee as I heat that up for about 2 minutes or more before I drink it. 1 minute is nothing to me, and Seeing as I\\'m not trying to taste this disgusting flavor of nutty origin, I try to slam it down as fast as possible.\\n\\nActually the biggest mistake of my life, as not only does peanut butter heat up MUCH faster than a typical liquid, It\\'s VERY thick and Insanely sticky. It was like Satan came in my mouth but it was stuck there and I couldn\\'t get it out. My friend is still laughing his ass of and I\\'m screaming at the top of my lungs as it goes further into my throat and I begin choking on the molten shit-liquid itsself. At this level I\\'m thinking \"I\\'m choking on lava\" and \"I really hope I don\\'t die because of the one time I eat peanut butter\"\\n\\nIn my suffering I finally stammer out \"Take me to the ER\" and his face Immediately changed\\n \\nI go for the milk we have in the fridge so I can walk out the door, but lucky me; we have not one drop of milk, nor any other liquid other than fucking A1 sauce, so I grab the sprayer in the kitchen sink and start blasting it in my mouth so as to mitigate the damage, but I can already tell that I\\'ve got some pretty severe burns.\\n\\nFlash forward to the Hospital, and Thanks to my idiocy I have second degree burns all over my mouth and throat, and After almost a week, I\\'m still in constant pain. I can\\'t taste anything except pain, I have burns on and around my tongue, my gums The roof of my mouth, my throat, and Can barely sleep due to the intensity of the pain.\\n\\nFML, and Fuck peanut butter. Never drink it, or you\\'ll end up like me.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: Got dared to drink melted peanut butter. Slammed it down to avoid Taste. Hot peanut butter is Basically Napalm and Hot PB + Mouth = Second Degree Burns. \\r\\nThis didn’t happen today, but I’m ready to tell the story now.\\n\\r\\nWhen my husband and I got together he had found a old, empty camera we started testing. We bought some film rolles and took some pictures here and there. After some time we got the images printed and they were mostly just bad pictures because the camera sucked. But we got some good pics from a festival, so we were happy. Time went on and we moved house a few times and then moved to another city. When we started unpacking we found a roll of pictures, and we thought it probably was from that old camera and it might be pictures from our honeymoon. We went to the camera shop to get the pictures printed instead of sending them in the mail. We had to wait one hour for them to finish the printing. So we just walked around the mall for a while. When one hour had passed, we walked back, paid and turned around, opened the wrapping and started looking at the pictures. The first picture was like a smack in the face, my husbands erect penis. Next one was me, naked and him doing naughty things to me.  \\nI could feel them looking at us. I felt like I was shrinking into the grund. I could not stop looking at the pictures while slowly realizing what I was looking at. I could not keep calm, so I just sprinted out, took the pictures and left my husband there. We could never go back there, not even to the mall, the only one in town, ever again. We moved home 6 months later.\\r\\n\\r\\nTL;DR\\r\\nFound an old roll of pictures and got them printed, turned out it was our home made porn.  This happened earlier this week and I’m still processing it. Also, throwaway because I don’t want my grandkids to find this one day. \\n\\nMy longtime girlfriend had just completed her time of the month, and we were ready to engage in some heated sexual activity. We’re both going through rather busy times in our life right now, so sex doesn’t come as often as it should, but enough to fulfill our needs. Now, the past few weeks I’ve been helping (doing) my GF do homework for one of her online classes. Because of this, she realized she owed me and decided to pay me by way of sexual favors. Unethical? Maybe, but I’m not complaining. So, she begins to initiate foreplay and start to enjoy one of the better blow jobs of my life. She does her thing for a while and I stop her a few times before I hit her with that high fructose porn syrup. After edging a few times, I decide to return the favor and go down on here. I do my thing, she does hers, and now back to me. Well, by this time we’re about an hour in and she starts to get tired. I finally comply with her and prepare to unleash my homemade protein shake. However, because I have delayed the inevitable for so long, she is taking breaks every few licks of the tootsie pop. The next four events happen all simultaneously. I let my lover know its time, she comes up for a breather, my Johnson flops down on my stomach (I’m on my back), and I treat myself to a very salty penis colada. It. Was. Everywhere. A catastrophic and life-changing event. I, and nor should you, ever take those cum shot compilations for granted. Those girls are troopers. \\n\\nTL;DR – I was edging during oral with my girlfriend. She got tired and took a break. I climaxed all over my face. \\n\\nEdit: Man y\\'all are wild. Thanks for the platinum, gold, and silver. Happy Holidays, may snow fall on all of your faces. \\\\[Obligatory this happened 6 years ago post notice.\\\\]\\n\\nTLDR: Wife pulls off an unbelievable video game upset on me; I yell at her and a tickle fight ensues, COPs come and I have to convince them tickle fight =/= real fight.\\n\\nIt\\'s a random Tuesday evening, and the wife and I have dinner plans to meet up with friends with some time to kill before we have to leave, so we decide to play a game of Madden on Playstation in our little 1 BR Apartment with neighbors on both sides and below us. I\\'m winning towards the end of the game but she gets a touchdown to put the game within 2. She does an onside kick and recovers it with literally two seconds left at the end of the play; I\\'m starting to sweat that she somehow pulls off some miraculous Hail Mary and wins. She ends up selecting a field goal and I\\'m feeling relieved; the wind is against her and it\\'s a 60+ yard field goal (for non football people, the record is 64 yards). She nails it perfectly and wins.\\n\\nI jump off the couch and am yell: \"ARE YOU KIDDING ME? ARE YOU JOKING? THIS IS BULLSH\\\\*T! I\\'M GOING TO F\\\\*CKING KILL YOU!\" She\\'s cracking up laughing and I start tickling her. She runs into the bedroom and I yell something like \"YOU CAN\\'T HIDE FROM ME! I\\'M GOING TO GET YOU!\" I tickle her maybe 1-2 minutes more on our bed as she\\'s cracking up/crying/yelling stop, but totally OK and within our normal boundaries of fun. We stop and she tells me she needs to get ready and starts heading into the bathroom to put on makeup.\\n\\nBy this point, maybe 5-10 minutes later, I\\'ve changed clothes, and am watching some TV when I hear a very loud, confident, series of knocks on the door. I open up, and SURPRISE, it\\'s two police officers: one man and one woman.\\n\\nMale cop: \"Good evening. Do you know why we are here?\"\\n\\nMe: \"I think so, and you\\'re never going to believe me, but I can explain.\"\\n\\nFemale cop: \"Is there a woman in this apartment, may I speak with her?\"\\n\\nMe: \"Yes, I am sure my wife will be willing to speak with you, she\\'s in the restroom around the corner getting ready for dinner.\"\\n\\nMale cop: \"what do you think we are here for?\"\\n\\nMe: \"I think one of my neighbors probably heard me yell at my wife and chase her into the next room as she screamed. In reality, it was a tickle fight after she beat me in a video game.\"\\n\\nMale cop: \"A tickle fight. Uh-huh. And what did you yell at her?\"\\n\\nMe: \"I said I was going to kill her, but it was really a joke, I promise, really, all I did after that was tickle her for a minute or two.\"\\n\\nMale cop: \"Where did you plan on going to dinner?\"\\n\\n(Feeling trashy saying this as someone who is suspected of spousal abuse) Me: \"Hooters. We are meeting friends at Hooters for wing night.\"\\n\\nMale cop: \"May I take a look around?\"\\n\\nMe: \"Yes.\"\\n\\nHe searches around, finds a broken vase in our recycle bin and asks about it. About 3-4 minutes later in what felt like an eternity, the female cop comes out and says: \"what did you hear?\"\\n\\nMale cop: \"Tickle fight.\"\\n\\nFemale cop: \"Tickle fight.\" She belts out one or two chuckles.\\n\\nMe (weight of the world off my shoulders)\\n\\nMale cop: \"alright, well, thanks for letting us come in and investigate, you know it\\'s just our jobs and we have to take this kind of thing seriously...\"\\n\\nMe: \"yes, yes, I totally understand and am not mad; just have to repair a relationship with our neighbors who think I beat my wife now...\"\\n\\nAfter they left, my wife told me the cop she spoke with was begging her to admit it that I was hurting her and she was covering her bruises with makeup, more like \"hey, you\\'re safe now, we got him, you can tell me the truth.\" I get why they do this, but thank God my wife was insistent and confident in her speech that I was not in fact beating her.\\n\\nWe hadn\\'t met our downstairs neighbors yet at that point, just a friendly wave out the door on the way to work each morning, but met them a few weeks later at a pool party the complex had. After some small talk, I just broke the ice and said: \"hey, just so you know, I think you guys must have called the police on me a few weeks back. I appreciate you called the police - I can understand how from your apartment, you just heard me yell \\'I\\'m going to kill you!\\' followed by two people running followed by screaming. Just so you know, it was a tickle fight and nothing else. I know that sounds ridiculous, but it\\'s true. Ultimately, you guys did the right thing.\" I got the feeling they were a little skittish, but overall grateful that I told them that. We remained on friendly terms but lost touch after we moved out of that complex.\\n\\nTLDR: Wife pulls off an unbelievable video game upset on me; I yell at her and a tickle fight ensues, COPs come and I have to convince them tickle fight =/= real fight.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdits:\\n\\n1. I am off to bed now but will try responding more tomorrow.\\n2. Yes, I know the title of the story raises eyebrows and makes people interested to read more. That\\'s the point of a good title in my opinion and I\\'ve seen this technique used many times on this subreddit. \\n3. Thanks for all the love - before this, I think I had gotten 2 awards ever. \\n4. I am pretty thrilled with reddit right now - definitely thought there would be a lot more trolls than there were. \\n5. Thanks for all the advice on dealing with police. In my opinion, there are times where I think it\\'s time to be a little bit more argumentative with them and times when it\\'s probably in everyone\\'s best interest to cooperate and defuse the situation. I think I smartly chose the latter in this case. FWIW, this occurred in a major urban area in the U.S. and I think it demonstrates that cops, as a whole, are generally pretty professional and genuinely just interested in making their communities safer. Without wading into politics, yes, I recognize that police reform is required in the U.S. and support many of those efforts too.  I live near a smaller airport and I help out at the local Turkish community center.  I’m white but I go to a free dinner they do every other Thursday and it is amazing, so I chose to volunteer every once in a while.   Set up, take down, help older people out, the usual volunteer at a center thing. I’ve met a ton of awesome people and they are a blast to hang out with.\\n\\nSo last week, I was tasked to pick up an older woman flying in from Turkey as she was the guest of honor at a fundraiser they were having. I was told she knew little to no English and I wasn’t the first choice to go get her, I was just the only one available seeing everyone else had bigger jobs to do. \\n\\nThey give me a sign with her surname on it, her flight number, and a general description of what she looked like. Whiteboard in hand and a little hesitant, I set off for the airport ready to get my cargo.\\n\\nI pull up to the international gate and immediately an Eastern European woman standing all alone. I get out with my sign that says ‘Demir’ and she smiles with great joy, points at the sign, points at herself and without hesitation, loads her bags in the car and hops in. Last name? Check. Eastern European? Check. Not much English? Check. can’t believe my luck!!\\n\\nI pull out of the airport and immediately head in the direction of the Turkish center with my passenger all buckled up ready for the 35 minute drive.  About 15 minutes into the ride, she pulls out her phone and begins to rustle around. She calls someone and frantically speaks in Turkish. I’m thinking she left something on the plane or at home. I felt bad but I couldn’t do anything about it at the time, I was driving in the freeway.\\n\\n10 minutes later, I’m off the freeway and a cop passes. He immediately flips a bitch, lights me up and I pull over. At this point I’m freaking out and when I turn around, I see the lady has Uber out and upon further inspection, I’m not the Uber driver.....\\n\\nThe cop tells me to get out and I am taken down very fast, by a plethora of cops, handcuffed, and put in the back of a squad car with zero information. My head hurts from the slam against the ground and I’m fully aware of the kidnapping situation I’m in. \\n\\nAfter about 15 minutes of the lady screaming in Turkish to the police and other cars arriving, an officer opens the door and asks me my story.  I ask him to use my phone to contact the Turkish center and the lead woman comes down to explain what happened. \\n\\nLittle did I know ‘Demir’ is one of the most common surnames in all of Turkey. So when the lady(her first trip to america) see that I have her name, she figures I’m the Uber driver ready to pick her up. She knows how to use google maps and saw we were headed in the opposite direction of her intended destination. My heart is still going 10,000 beats a minute while another car with a friend from the center and what could be the real ‘Demir’ pulls up. \\n\\nAfter a discussion that I’m not a part of takes place, the cops get me out of the car, unhand-cuff me and everyone, including the kidnapped woman, seems to be laughing....except me. I am in disbelief as of to what just happened and I definitely sweated through my entire outfit. We get back to the Turkish center and the story spread like wild fire. Everyone comes up to me with a hug, a laugh, and a drink. I got drunk drunk. \\n\\nTL;DR by picking up the wrong woman and getting arrested for kid napping. First names count, people!!!\\n\\nEdit: detained, not arrested. Also, talking with Turks, they all have varying degrees of where the country resides. Eastern is too white, middle is bad in America, so most of them just say they are from Turkey. \\nThe following events transpired yesterday. Spent last night in A&E, on hardly any sleep and some pretty strong painkillers, so apologies for any mistakes here.\\n\\nMe and my girlfriend are trying to lose weight, and so for the past few months we have been eating super clean. Salads, quinoa, lean meats, etc. (very few carbs). Lost some weight, gained some muscle from working out too. Very happy with our progress.\\n\\nBecause we had been so disciplined and it was my birthday, we decided to treat ourselves to our previously weekly treat of takeout. A huge pizza, fries, and nachos each (I know, hence why we needed to lose weight), washed down with soda. \\n\\nWe went to bed feeling very full and happy, if a little guilty.\\n\\nI awoke a few hours later with intense stomach cramps. I could feel a ball of pizza nacho fries forming in the pit of my stomach and could tell it was not going to be pretty coming out. I waited till morning to go to the bathroom (small apartment, light sleeper gf), and as soon as I sat down on the crapper and pushed, I felt the most intense pain in my anal sphincter. Like it was being pulled apart from every angle. My girlfriend, who I had woken up by screaming, was now banging on the bathroom door thinking I was being murdered.\\n\\nThe worst part was that I couldn\\'t exactly pinch this bad boy off, as the seal had been broken and my \\'pincher\\' was now severely compromised. So I pushed through the pain, and could feel the ripping worsen with each push as this dry, fibrous monster made it\\'s way out of my asshole. After about 25 minutes I had birthed the hellsnake. I only wish I had taken a photo as this thing was a sight to behold.\\n\\nA painful car journey and 3 hour wait later, the doctor said I had the worst anal fissures he had ever seen. Apparently the turd was so fat and hard it\\'d literally ripped my asshole open in multiple places.\\n\\nSitting is agony, they itch and burn like hell and I can feel a second boulder pushing its way into my lower intestine. \\n\\nFor all you sickos:\\n\\nDimensions: Difficult to say. Closer to Randy\\'s first record attempt than I would be comfortable disclosing.\\n\\nCourics: I don\\'t know, I forgot to contact the European Fecal Standards team for verification. I would say more than one, less than four.\\n\\nColor: Dark. I drink a lot of coffee.\\n\\nTexture: Like a sock filled with broken marbles. \\n\\nTL;DR Avoided bad food for months, gorged on pizza and nachos, gave birth to a baby sized turd that ripped my anal cavity open on its way out, resulting in the worst anal fissures my doctor had ever seen. AMA\\n\\nEdit: I\\'m sorry Reddit, I didn\\'t take a photo. I wish I did. I wish I could go back in time and fix this...wait, no I don\\'t. I don\\'t want this to turn into a Reddit fable where my compromised pincher is being spread between the dark corners of the web for the rest of time, so no I will not be squatting over a mirror and taking a picture of my anus. Sorry. I also love my girlfriend too much to ask her to get in there with a camera; there\\'s no use in two people being traumatized by this.\\n\\nFor all those sending get well messages and asking for updates: thank you sincerely. My girlfriend got over her anxiety and collected a cornucopia of stool softeners, numbing sprays, ice packs, and everything else imaginable. Thank you all for the advice. She and the chemist shared a laugh when she showed her the story. How nice... Okay so the obligatory this happened a few months back.\\n\\nA little backstory, I have dealt with severe depression and suicidal thoughts, have a few (obviously) unsuccessful attempts. Good news; I\\'m better now and I laugh about it. I was better back then too.\\n\\nAlso worth mentioning I\\'m into writing short stories and currently a novel.\\n\\nSo back to the fuck-up, a short story I was writing back then started off with a 15 year old girl finding a suicide letter dated 10 years into the future, and is in her own handwriting. I bet you can see where this is going.. So I start drafting the letter and before I finish it with the dating and stuff I get a call from my friend saying she is around and wants to talk, so I get out saying very little to my mom.\\n\\nAfter leaving in a hurry and staying outside for a few hours my mom gets worried and calls me. *Shocker* I left my phone at home. (It\\'s really not a rare thing for me to do, it\\'s rare I take it with me unless I\\'m going to school or a date or something) she goes into my room and sees \"my\" suicide note.\\n\\nShe gets scared and calls my dad. Soon after, my family is driving around looking for me. I walk back home and to my surprise there is police cars and my parents are crying. After a quick explaining and a few hours of scolding everything was fine but I felt terrible for putting my parents through that fear again.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: Me, a previously suicidal teen, writes a suicide letter for a short story, then leaves the house in a hurry, parents call the cops thinking I killed myself, I show up eating ice cream and get scolded. Generally felt terrible\\n\\n\\nEdit: wow a lot of you want to read the horrible piece of fiction I wrote back then, I can\\'t find the original story but I\\'ll try to rewrite from memory in the morning!\\n\\nEdit2: ah yes the good old severe suicide  So the mess up happened yesterday and I\\'m still saying \"oh my god\" to myself every time I think about it.\\n\\nThis past Saturday our school\\'s girls Cross Country team won state and because of that earned everyone a pep rally. The night before someone asked if anyone wanted to be the flag runner and I [happily volunteered](https://i.imgur.com/qfllRsL.jpg), because that\\'s a super dope job. I mean what could possibly go wrong?\\n\\nWell here is exactly what went wrong:\\n \\nThe pep rally is in motion. The Cross Country Team starts pouring down from the stands to lead a school cheer. This is exactly when you should do a flag run, so I start haulin\\' out and narrowly avoid plowing one girl and make my way around the crowd (Definitely wouldn\\'t recommend to a friend now though). I am caught up in the buzz of the moment and then all of a sudden I\\'m [going down hard...](https://i.imgur.com/XPL4P0i.mp4)\\nAll that is going through my head is siren noises and me thinking \"I should just die now\" but unfortunately that never came to fruition and it got worse as I saw what I had tripped on and destroyed: [The state trophy we just won AND the one from last year!](https://i.imgur.com/gyAgaiL.png)\\nNow I\\'m a bit more famous around the school and kids keep seeing me in the hallway an saying \"OMG! You\\'re the kid who broke the trophy!!\"\\nRIP me\\n\\nTL;DR I was the flag runner and I tripped over and destroyed two state trophies in front of the whole school.\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks for the gold! That makes it all worth it (sort of)! Just a bit of extra info, the trophies have been repaired with tender, sweet words and some wood glue.\\n\\nEDIT 2: Wow 5 gold I\\'m willing to destroy another trophy, if it nets me 5 more! This just happened minutes ago. I’m in a children’s hospital with my wife and son because he’s been having severe asthma issues.\\n\\nMy wife is laying in the bed with my son on top of her, and I’ve just been sitting in one of the chairs. As people kept coming in, I noticed some rather odd looks from them, some mumbling, and some more odd looks. I figured I had some food on my face or something and didn’t think too much of it.\\n\\nSuddenly, I’m sitting there reading something on reddit when my wife looks at me and says, “What’s that between your legs?”\\n\\nI look down, and there’s a pink ball between my legs. Confusion quickly turns to shock as I realize that pink ball is one of *my* balls. One of my testicles is literally hanging out of my pants and is sitting on the seat.\\n\\nI don’t have a spare pair of pants here, so now I’m just sitting with my legs tightly together like I’m wearing a skirt and praying my son doesn’t stay here long.\\n\\nTL;DR I found out I had a hole in my pants by multiple people noticing a testicle sitting on my chair.\\n\\n**EDIT: Most common question is about my undergarments. I was indeed wearing boxers. My testicle came out the bottom of them.**\\n\\nEDIT2: Wow this post really got the ball rolling (what, I can’t do testy puns too?). Thank you kind stranger for the coconut reward! I had no idea such an appropriate award existed for this situation.\\n\\n**EDIT3: I GOT PANTS! As several people suggested, I explained my predicament to the nurse, and she hooked me up with a pair of scrub pants. They’ll make excellent pajama pants.**\\n\\nAnd thank you for another coconut! I have two now! How fitting. Thank you, kind stranger.\\n\\nEDIT4: Another coconut (three nuts now—one can fall out, and I still have two left) and a silver. Thank you again!\\n\\nEDIT5: Popped my gold cherry. Guess everything is popping for me today. Thank you, internet stranger!\\n\\n**EDIT6: Dammit! Replacement pants are actually worse than original pants. [Here’s me wearing them on top of my pants](https://imgur.com/a/xI6y80B). The “fly” makes no sense. Wife confirms it.**\\n\\nEDIT7: Thank you to /u/jedberg for evening out my balls at two pairs and another kind stranger for more silver!\\n\\n**LAST EVER EDIT: Son is doing better. We can hopefully leave tomorrow. My ball has been staying put in two sets of pants. Thank you for all the love and support everyone. Sorry for going a little (lot) edit crazy. Just overwhelmed by all the support.** At the office today, there was a raffle for some stuffed animal toys and I won one. I chose one that looked almost exactly like my cat thinking I\\'d get a cute photo of them together.\\n\\nI get home and put the toy on the bed next to her and snap a photo. She doesn\\'t care, but hey, mission accomplished. \\n\\nFast forward 6 hrs and I\\'m playing Rollercoaster Tycoon 2. I suddenly hear my cat howling up a storm and look over to the bed and she is crying at the stuffed version of herself. She\\'s picking it up by the neck, dragging it around, setting it down, staring into its lifeless eyes, and just crying nonstop. \\n\\nI take it away from her but she doesn\\'t stop howling. Her fur is all puffed up and her eyes look so scared. I think she thought it was a dead cat. I open the door to my room and she bolts out and starts cowering in the furthest corner of the apartment from my room. She won\\'t let me near her.\\n\\nI feel like a villain. I love her more than anything and now she\\'s fearing for her life.\\n\\nTldr; I brought a stuffed cat toy home for my cat. She thought I brought her a dead cat and freaked out.\\n\\nEDIT: By request, I\\'m paying the cat tax. This is Mushroom and she\\'s 9 years old. I adopted her two weeks ago after fostering her for a couple months.\\n[Cat and cat toy](https://i.vgy.me/MyCcA7.jpg)\\n\\nEdit 2: For people asking if she\\'s okay, when I woke up this morning she was sleeping on my shoulder like always so I think she\\'s forgiven me. However, I\\'m never bringing a cat effigy into the apartment again. Thanks for caring about my cat guys!! This happened about thirty minutes ago. So I\\'ve been Covid gardening since March, growing stuff from seeds, and my tomatoes are monsters. Six feet high and still going. Temps have been in the upper 90\\'s, so I need to water them twice a day. I check their condition, note they do need water, then see an actual TOMATO OMG. Since this is the first edible thing I\\'ve seen after three months of backbreaking work, I\\'m understandably excited. I lean forward to examine said first glorious tomato. As I do, my bright red hair swings into eyeball range, and I see a GIANT FUCKING WASP tangled in it. Now, in hindsight it probably was normal-sized, but as it was right in front of my eyeball, I promise you it looked gargantuan.\\n\\nThe wasp is, as you can imagine, not terribly pleased to be trapped in the thickets of my hair. I do not panic, however. I grab the base of that hank of hair and hold it while still leaning forward so the angry little bastard doesn\\'t swing directly into my face. I go into problem-solving mode. The wasp does not wish to be in my hair-I do not wish the wasp to be in my hair. Yet, I sense, cooperation will not be possible. I instead enlist physics as my helper and attempt to fling the little fucker free by cracking my hair like a whip. Alas for my B grade in PH 221--Physics decided it is not my bitch today. I whip the angry little bastard RIGHT DOWN THE CLEAVAGE OF MY TANK TOP.\\n\\nSmall aside: I have more cleavage-related woes than any other two women I know. It is a black hole for bad luck. And on one memorable occasion, sushi from across a crowded restaurant. A TALE FOR LATER. \\n\\nHaving switched directly from \"not panicking I can solve this\" to \"panicking now I HAVE A WASP IN MY BOOBS,\" I yank the neck of my tank top forward in an attempt to keep the buzzing motherfucker from digging a hole in my fun bags. Luckily, the wasp appeared to watch a lot of fashion television and was instead attacking my tank top. I mean, I get it. No one wants to be flung into leaf green ribbed polyester. It is so last summer. \\n\\nHaving learned absolutely nothing from my previous flirtation with centripetal force, I again attempt to whip the little fucker free. Naturally, it goes directly into my face. I slap it away with my free hand, and it goes back into my cleavage. But fortunately this time it hits my boob at such an angle that it bounces out to freedom!\\n\\nStill bent forward and holding my tank top\\'s neck at least a foot from me, I crow in victory and straighten up, immediately making awkward eye contact with the three stunned construction workers in my neighbor\\'s back yard. No, I was not wearing a bra. So yeah, I just flashed those poor men with leaning forward middle-aged dangle boobs. Fluttering like pennants in the wind. Not the most flattering angle. \\n\\nDid I attempt to explain my entirely reasonable circumstances to those baffled people? No, I did not. I just scuttled inside like the fuck-up I am, and now I can never go outside again and my tomatoes still need to be watered. But I pinged that little winged bastard like a backhand at Wimbledon and I did NOT get stung, so not entirely a loss? I dunno.\\n\\ntl;dr: Monster tomatoes lead to cleavage wasp, and my titty semaphore is not understood by baffled bystanders.\\n\\nEdit: Wow, I crashed and went to bed after reading a few very nice comments that made my night, and woke up to a very full inbox. Thank you! Also, yes I snuck out after dark to water the tomatoes, they are going to be fine! I watered them again this morning. There are no construction people over at my neighbor\\'s yet, but they appear to be building a fence, so I\\'m going back inside before they come back and continue with that.\\n\\nEdit the second: [Pics for those demanding them (banana for scale)](https://i.imgur.com/STu43Bk.jpg) and [The beauty you wanted](https://i.imgur.com/XF7VJDh.jpg) Like many men, this quarantine gave me (a 35yo Male) a good opportunity to grow out a beard.  So, I\\'m on a Sales Department WebEx Call (probably 300 people) and since no one has seen me in about a month, it was a bit of a surprise to see me with facial hair.  A friend at the company privately messages me through WebEx, \"Dude what happened to your face?\"  I thought it would be funny to reply with \"Good News!  I finally hit puberty!!!\"  except that message wasn\\'t private - it went to everyone on the call...  like everyone - without any context around it.  Just imagine sitting there on a company webex call listening to the SVP of Sales and out of nowhere your coworker sends you a message saying \"Good News! I finally hit puberty.\"  That coworker was me.\\n\\nTL;DR Coworker sent private message to me on a call with 300 people asking about my new beard.  I accidentally sent the 300 people a message saying \"Good News! I finally hit puberty!!!\"\\n\\n\\nEdit: Glad you all enjoyed the story.. Totally unrelated but since I\\'ll never have an audience this big again, I am announcing my faith publicly. The Bible says, if I deny Him before men, He will deny me before His Father in Heaven so with an audience of 100,000+ people, I am a believer in Jesus Christ. I believe He is the son of God, was crucified on the cross and died for my sins but rose on the 3rd day to give me salvation. I accept Jesus as my Lord and Savior...Boom. I\\'m  a happily married male security guard, working third shift at a sleepy  little hospital. Technically, it\\'s just a stand-alone Emergency Room, and if anybody needs further  treatment, they get sent to one of two or three \"real\" hospitals.\\n\\nShe\\'s a nurse that just started working here, and I\\'ve just started getting  to know. She was telling me about her upcoming wedding today, and we  chatted for a little bit about her selling her old house, my marriage  jitters five years ago, and the like. It seemed very friendly, and I  could tell how excited she was for this wedding. She had kind things to  say about me and my story, but I took it as just friendly chatter instead of flirting.\\n\\nI was sitting  at my desk, browsing reddit on one screen while the cameras are on the  other, and I saw movement in the triage room, which is odd because there  aren\\'t any patients in the building. Nobody in the lobby either. It\\'s  the nurse who\\'s about to get married, who slips off her shoes. And  pants. And top. I could see she shaves her bikini area, and the lacy  bits on her bra, which is all she\\'s wearing except socks. She steps onto  the scale, fiddles with her bra a little bit, and then steps back off  and gets dressed again.\\n\\nNow my  heart is racing. I\\'m sick to my stomach; I can\\'t believe what I just  saw. It feels gross to have intruded on something like that. What am I  supposed to do? I decide that what I\\'m not going to do is tell my  supervisor. I don\\'t think there\\'s a way for me to delete the video  footage, and I know that if my higher-ups know what to look for, they  can find it. I don\\'t think they just browse everything randomly, though,  so if I don\\'t draw attention to it, chances are good no one else will  see it. Right?\\n\\nNone of that was my  fault. What was my fault, is that I got her attention on her way out  the door and said something really stupid.\\n\\n\"Hey, good luck showing the house.\"  \\n\"Thanks!\" She smiled.  \\n\"Hey,\" I hesitated. The anxiety started to choke me.  \\n\"I don\\'t know how to tell you this, but there are cameras in the triage room.\"  \\n\\n\\nI  watched confusion make way to realization, followed by disgust. Utter  disgust. Anger, perhaps? I was still reeling and wondering how I  expected this news to be taken. I hadn\\'t thought that far ahead.  \\n\\n\\n\"I did not know that,\" she spat out, trying to look anywhere but at me.  \\n\\n\\n\"I  won\\'t tell anyone. Umm, good luck fitting in your wedding dress? See  you later.\" I still don\\'t know where in the everlasting hell that came  from. She left without saying anything more.\\n\\nTL;DR ... I should have just suffered in silence with the knowledge of  what my co-worker\\'s naked body looked like. The look of disgust on her  face is now burned in my face more than her nudity ever was.\\n\\nI don\\'t plan on telling anyone at work what I saw, but venting to reddit may help me get these emotions in check enough to sleep before my next shift. Tylenol PM will probably help, too.  \\n\\n\\nEDIT: I mentioned a lot of details about her state of undress, trying to get across the point that the [cameras had a pretty good shot](https://imgur.com/a/YaiR1xA). I don\\'t think I can pan or zoom, but I didn\\'t have to. And she wasn\\'t wearing any panties under her scrubs, hence the \"just bra and socks.\"   \\n\\n\\nMy only explanation for the \"Good luck fitting in your dress\" comment is that I was desperately trying to move the conversation forward in a positive direction. And that was the best explanation in my mind for her behavior, so it was the first thing my anxious brain caught hold of. It really wasn\\'t supposed to be a fat joke because she is absolutely slim. Yes, I know I\\'m clueless. Hence why I\\'m in /r/TIFU.  \\n\\n\\n I really didn\\'t want to believe that she was flirting in our conversation, and that she would do it on purpose, but I left out the fact that our conversation directly before the incident started with me saying something along the lines of \"Hey, I played back the camera footage, and that creepy guest that didn\\'t leave when the patient they were visiting left? Yeah, I made sure they left the building. They\\'re gone.\" Thirty minutes after that conversation, she is [standing directly under a camera and demonstrating that she\\'s been going commando all night.](https://imgur.com/a/YaiR1xA) The timing was slightly suspicious, but I didn\\'t want to believe it.  \\n\\n\\nAlthough now a third option comes to mind. Being really slim and having a compulsion to weigh yourself at work... could that possibly indicate a former or current eating disorder? Now I\\'m even more of a jerk. \\n\\nI told my wife, and she was slightly embarrassed for the nurse and for me, but being a nurse herself, she\\'s inserted enough catheters to not be phased by the human body too much. We still had sex before she went to bed and I went to work. Removed The lunch guy at my job thinks I\\'m Muslim.\\nIt started off with a subtle \"do you want the Turkey sausage instead\". At this point I\\'m thinking \"well maybe something is wrong with the pork sausage\".  Admittedly, part of me suspected the mistake then because I\\'m pretty brown looking, I have a beard, and Arab and Desi people have mistaken me for one of their own plenty of times. Let\\'s be real, he damn sure didn\\'t think I was Jewish (*funny story: I\\'m jewish enough to legally immigrate to Israel under their current law of return but this is just a detail.*). \\nBut I didn\\'t speak up. \\nWell today I went to grab a pancake plate with bacon and he looked alarmed and of course I pipe up and said \"oh it\\'s fine I\\'ll just eat around it\" which is somewhat true: I don\\'t actually like bacon and I really did just want the pancakes. I must admit however that this was to avoid confronting him on the matter (there was a whole line of people behind me). Well, as thoughtful and nice as he is, he insisted that he could make me a new one and that he would feel bad if I took the plate just to make it easier for him because then I\\'d be being a *bad Muslim* just to convenience him. Well then. \\nThis was the first time that he outright called me Muslim.\\nDid I come clean, confess the truth  and embarrass him? No, in fact I\\'m at my desk wondering what I\\'m going to do for Ramadan.\\n\\n\\nEdit:     \\n\\n1. Thanks for the gold.           \\n\\n2. The cafeteria guy is a really nice guy, loud, jokes around with everyone in such a way that every morning is almost like a group conversation between me, him, and the rest of the line. It\\'s a great way to start a morning- the guy is very personable. The flipside is that the times where I might privately correct the matter are few and far between.           \\n\\n3. *That Seinfeld interpretation was absolutely legendary.*          \\n\\n4. I really wish I would have spelt *too* correctly.           \\n\\n5. To everyone calling me a p\\\\*ssy, wimp, etc: whatever makes you feel tough I guess. I had quite a bit more to say on the matter but frankly it just wasn\\'t worth the drama.\\n\\n>TL;DR    \\nTIFU up by being too shy to speak up and tell the cafeteria guy at my job that I wasn\\'t Muslim, now I\\'m too deep in the lie, and have to roll with it until I have the courage and, more importantly, right setting to come clean.  This happened this morning. \\n\\nI had stayed the night at my boyfriends dorm, and so we were both crammed on his shitty dorm mattress. \\n\\nThe night went by very peaceful. In the morning I woke up, stood up and stretched, and then headed out to the kitchen. I grabbed a glass of water and chugged it, and then checked my period tracker app. The app said I was a couple days late, so I decided to take a pregnancy test. \\n\\nI went to the bathroom, opened up the test, sat down and began to take it. When I looked at the test, the screen was completely distorted. I couldn’t read if it was positive or not, so I decided to try another one. \\n\\nI open a new test, sit down, and miraculously, have a lot more pee in me. I start peeing like a mad man. It is just FLOWING out of me onto the stick. It seems never ending. \\n\\nAnd then suddenly it stops. \\n\\nAnd I wake up. In my boyfriends tiny bed. With him sleeping soundly right next to me. A puddle of my piss spreading across the mattress like wildfire. \\n\\nIt was on his sheets, comforter, and his shirt that I was wearing. Luckily I was able to wake him and get him to move before it reached him. \\n\\nThe level of embarrassment I felt was insane. We took the sheets off and cleaned up, but I didn’t have a change of clothes so I had to put on yesterday’s dirty clothes and sit in shame. \\n\\nHe’s been cracking bed wetter jokes all day now and I truly feel like I’ll never live this down. \\n\\nTLDR: dreamt I was taking a pregnancy test, actually pissed in my boyfriends bed.\\n\\nEdit: I feel like some people are misunderstanding. My boyfriend “cracking bed wetter jokes” isn’t a bad/rude thing. I think it’s funny, and he’s a really great guy. He was completely understanding, helped me clean up and didn’t for a second make me feel like I should be ashamed. He tried to make me feel better about it, and then afterwards the jokes started. Now it’s sort of like an inside joke. This TIFU is lighthearted! I\\'m a very socially awkward person.\\n\\nSo when the numerous hours of back-and-forth chit chat with women on Tinder resulted in a first date I was ecstatic. We had matched a week or two back to my surprise and started talking about our personal interests; TV shows, movies, and what not. After my conversational cannon fodder of questions started to run dry, I decided \"fuck it\" and asked if she wanted to see Rogue One with me last Friday night. She said yes!\\n\\nThe night comes and I decide to start getting ready by picking out some nice looking clothes aside from the typical bullshit that I wear on a daily basis. Jeans, a white shirt, boots, and a nice jacket I\\'d received from my mother on Christmas. It was raining too so I grabbed an umbrella on my way out.\\n\\nI get on the train and walk to the rendezvous. I wait 10 or so minutes and see her walking down the street. Nervous, I walk out into the rain with the umbrella to meet her. We shake hands, say hi to one another, and I ask if she\\'s ready to head down to the movie theater. She says yes and off we go.\\n\\nHere\\'s where it went south.\\n\\nWe\\'re walking through the rain and come up to a big, water-filled street corner. I\\'m not sure whether it was nerves or my own lack of social skills which compelled me to do what I did, but I immediately stop and start to take off my jacket. Confused, she asks what I\\'m doing to which I reply, \"I got this.\"  She quickly realizes what I\\'m about to do and starts saying \"Oh, you don\\'t have t-\". \\n\\nI cut her off by throwing my jacket into this huge puddle expecting her to walk on it and onto the curb like you see in old movies/shows. The silence quickly makes me realize what I\\'ve done. I mutter out a \"After you...\" and she continues to stare at me.\\n\\nWithout a word, she ghosts me on the spot. I pick my jacket up out of the puddle and make my walk of shame home.\\n\\nMaybe next time. Short but sweet, obligatory TL;DR at the bottom.\\n\\nI (F 34) was on my way back home from work, passing by the local grocery store and supermarket, located very close to my home.There are normally lots of stray cats in the neighborhood, but there is one in particular that always comes running when she sees me, so even when I am loaded with shopping bags, I can\\'t help myself petting her.Today was no exception. I made sure to pet her only with the left hand, because I knew I wouldn\\'t be able to wash my hands immediately (love her but she is kinda dingy), so to avoid touching my face or hair (as I often do), I was trying to do everything with my right hand.\\n\\nSo I go to the supermarket next, already on the cash register, unloading my basket and chit-chatting with the boy who works it (he looks to be in his early 20\\'s, kinda cute), like I normally do.While I\\'m helping him arrange all items in my bag, I followed his gaze and noticed the questioning look he gave my left hand, as it must have appeared quite weird that I wouldn\\'t use it, and instead hold it aside, like a surgeon ready to operate.Me being the kind of person who feels the need to explain any misunderstandings away (because God forbid somebody thinks something weird about me, lol) chirp up casually:-Oh, I just stroke a kitty with that hand, so I try not to touch anything else before I wash my hands properly.Mind you, I said that in my native language, where the word for kitty and the euphemism are interchangeable, like *p.u.s.s.y* in English.\\n\\nHe stopped scanning the groceries for a moment and when I looked at him, he had this priceless expression on his face.... Eyes a little wide, sort of flushed, looking at me in disbelief.Only then did it hit me what I said and how it must have sounded to him.I quickly corrected myself, elaborating saying:-Kitty. Cat, you know. A stray. Meow meow. (Yes, I really said that....\\\\*cringe\\\\*)\\n\\nHe made an \"Oooooh...\" sound and bit his lips suppressing a burst of laughter.\\n\\nI think I might shop elsewhere in the next few days... \\\\*facepalm\\\\*\\n\\nTL;DR: I accidentally woke somebody\\'s dirty mind by making him think I\\'ve pet my kitty...\\n\\n**EDIT**: Thank you so much for the platinum and silver, I just wanted to vent by sharing a mildly cringe-worthy story from my day with a healthy dose of self-irony. \\n\\nI didn\\'t expect it to blow out like it did.   \\nI appreciate all the kind and funny comments, BUT I\\'m also shocked to see how far could some people twist my words into extremely dark connotations - I even saw comments about me being creepy, predatory etc, which is absurd.  \\nI know I shouldn\\'t \"feed the trolls\" by engaging and reasoning, what reasoning when somebody posts an absurd comment meant solely to upset or offend, indeed.  \\nBut seriously, those who suggested I was in any way deliberately inappropriate or had some hidden lewd agenda towards this guy - I suggest you read my post again carefully and then if you still think so, seek some professional help, because the issue is with you, not with me. So some of you may remember my original post where I accidentally saw pictures of my girlfriend sucking the biggest dick I’ve ever seen:\\n\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bo6nut/tifu_by_swiping_on_my_girlfriends_phone_nsfw/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app\\n\\nI’ve had had thousands of messages asking for an update, and a similar amount of messages asking for the pictures (I don’t have them and I don’t want to see them again).\\n\\nThe truth is there isn’t much of an update because I never confronted her about it. I decided that it was my problem not hers, and that this may be one of those rare occasions where it would be more healthy for our relationship to leave the past in the past.\\n\\nOur sex life is back to normal and I feel like I’ve mostly processed the situation in a healthy way. We all have things in our past, and the most important thing is we are happy and we love each other.  \\n\\nI thought I would also use this as an opportunity to address some of the most common questions/comments.\\n\\n—\\n\\nWHY DOES SHE STILL HAVE THE PICTURES?\\n\\nHonestly I think she probably forgot. We all have stuff on our phones going back years. I found some nudes of exes that I had forgotten about so I guess I’m as bad as her.\\n\\nHOW DID YOU KNOW IT WAS HER EX?\\n\\nBecause I could see a gallery of thumbnails from the same set and some had his face in\\n\\nWAS IT PHOTOSHOPPED OR A STRAP-ON?\\n\\nNo\\n\\nYOU MUST BE EXAGGERATING NO DICK IS THAT BIG\\n\\n2 coke cans is about right. It was bigger than her forearm.\\n\\nAs you can imagine, I’ve also received a bunch of dick pics in my DMs with guys comparing their dicks to 2 coke cans. Thanks for that chaps.  \\n\\nA DICK THAT BIG COULDN’T GET HARD\\n\\nIt certainly seemed rock hard in the pictures, but she had previously mentioned that an ex had erection problems and relied on viagra. So maybe you’re right.\\n\\nHER PUSSY MUST BE STRETCHED/CAVERNOUS/GAPING\\n\\nShe probably has the tightest vagina of all the girls I’ve been with. I guess you don’t know how vaginas work.\\n\\n—\\n\\nSomeone told me that my original post was the most upvoted NSFW post in the history of Reddit. I don’t know if that’s true, but I guess that’s pretty cool.\\n\\n\\n\\nTL;DR accidentally saw pictures of my girlfriend sucking the biggest dick in the world, processed the situation in a healthy way and everything is back to normal Obligatory, this didn\\'t happen today but a few days ago, etc. Anyways, me and my girl were getting it on at my house when this happened. She likes to do some roleplay stuff which I don\\'t mind and one of them involves me being a traveler in another country and her being a waitress or something who barely speaks any English. Tonight, I was in Germany. So everything started off fine and went really well until I started to feel myself coming to my climax, I wasn\\'t super worried because she\\'d already \\'Finished\\' but I still wanted to keep going a little longer myself. So, I started thinking of funny shit to take my mind off things a bit and hopefully distract some more runtime into me. I ask her a question as dirty talk (I\\'ll spare you the details), but she started going \"Nein, Nein, Nein\" in response. Well naturally my mind went to Hitler, seeing as how the Nazis ruined German for everyone lol, and I ended up saying out loud by accident, \"Jesus, it sounds like I\\'m fucking Hitler.\" She stopped dead in her tracks for a second and then started to laugh, I panicked for a second, lost my concentration and came immediately. She thinks it\\'s hilarious, I personally find it mortifying and embarassing. I find the fact I can now say I orgasmed right after stating it feels like I\\'m fucking Hitler, equally mortifying as well. But eh, that\\'s probably not even the worst thing I\\'ve said to ruin the mood during sex, just the most recent. \\n\\n\\nTL;DR: Was having some roleplay sexytime with my girlfriend, her pretending to be german and barely know English, she started saying Nein to which I responded \"It feels like I\\'m fucking Hitler.\" Before immediately orgasming.\\n\\n\\nSo, how bad did I fuck up? I\\'d say not too too bad personally all things considered lol.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEDIT: There was consequences to this, albeit not the biggest but this still makes me cringe a lot and is really embarrassing to me, and now with how popular this post is getting I\\'m feeling it really hard lol. That and my girlfriend has been making fun of me about it for the past few days. Oh, and something I forgot to mention too that makes it a much bigger fuck up is the fact I\\'m away at college and was just visiting my hometown for a few days. That\\'ll be the last time we get to do it for well over a month, so yeah not the best way to go out.\\n\\n\\nEdit 2: I didn\\'t put that bit about her finishing once or twice in as a brag, that\\'s just how she is it\\'s like someone dialed her sensitivity up to 11. To be honest I highly doubt I\\'d be able to make a different girl even finish at all lmao.\\nOh and also the Nazis ruined German thing is just a joke I\\'m just taking a WW2 history course rn.\\n\\nEdit 3: Felt I should add this; Thanks to everyone who\\'s liking this and especially giving awards, I couldn\\'t imagine spending money just to tell a stranger you liked something they said so thanks so much to those of you that did. This is by far my most popular post/comment/anything and the only thing I\\'ve gotten awards on in the 4 years I\\'ve been on here. For reference my previous highest voted post was sitting at like 700 something on r/titanfolk . So yeah, this is wild. Thanks everyone. Almost two years ago now.\\n\\nTwo kids, boys, 5 and 4. Fight like cats and dogs. Anything to annoy the other and start a fight. Grab a random object and throw it at the other when Dad isn\\'t looking kind of thing.\\n\\nOne day I\\'m cleaning up the kitchen and the ruckus is extreme. I interject and sit them both down for a long talk about how much better things can be if they cooperate instead. At the end of it, I went back into the kitchen and resumed cleaning. A remarkable length of *quiet* while later, the 4yo comes to me.\\n\\n4yo: Dad, Dad, come see what I made! \\\\*grabbing my hand\\\\*\\n\\nMe: Sure, lets see.\\n\\nHe leads me to their room to the corner table where they have art supplies. And points to the papers on the table. He likes to draw and I encourage it when I can. What I see on the table however, are just random scribbles...\\n\\nMe: Is this what you wanted to show me? \\\\*I pick up the paper and check both sides, just a few random scribbles\\\\*\\n\\nMe: That\\'s... great buddy, but why don\\'t you come get me when it\\'s finished? \\\\*I put the paper down and turn to walk\\\\*\\n\\n4yo: No, NO! Dad, *LOOK!* \\\\*pointing at the papers\\\\*\\n\\nOkay, maybe I missed one? I look through them again, no, just scribbles? I\\'m still looking at them when suddenly..\\n\\n4yo grabs the papers from my hand and tosses them back on the table.\\n\\n4yo: OK Dad, I\\'ll show you later, you can go. \\\\*pushing me towards the door\\\\*\\n\\nI\\'m a little confused, he\\'s not like this usually. I pause outside their room, and when I do, I hear the crinkle of cellophane. \\n\\nMy boys room is off the hallway leading to the stairs down the the basement. The stairs to the basement, are crinkling. \\n\\nI poke my head around the corner of the staircase and there is 5yo. With a package of Oreos clutched to his chest. He looks at me with big eyes and I just hold out one hand and point with the other. I took the package and he walked by right as I couldn\\'t hold my Dad face any longer. \\n\\nSee, the Oreos were on top of the refrigerator. So what has happened is 4yo baited me, while 5yo got a chair from the dining room, carried it to the kitchen to retrieve the loot then put the chair back and hid. This has to have been meticulously plotted. I\\'m a mix of horrified and proud.\\n\\nI had to quickly put Dad face back on to tell them to not sneak treats and to now clean their room. Then I left the room and had a brief \"What have I done?\" moment back in the living room.\\n\\nTL;DR My kids went from the Animaniacs to Pinky and the Brain. Yes, this actually happened today, see Imgur link. Also, sorry for this being long, see tl;dr below.\\n\\nI matched with a girl on Tinder today. The profile was ambiguous, just a picture of her laying down on her belly, no bio. I usually start with a creative message derived from the pictures or bio. [I decided to just message her, \"I don\\'t have much to go off from your profile. What does come to mind is that you have a nice looking butt\" She responds, \"Wanna touch my butt in perosn\"](https://imgur.com/a/x6cAs3V) You can read the rest of the conversation from that Imgur link. Bottom line is, we decided to meet at my apartment and that I would give her $40 for some weed.\\n\\nThis felt like a whole new level of trashy for me. So far in life, I have only had sex with four people, and I make a serious attempt to date them. I asked my friends what I should do, they said it did not seem too sketch. I was going to say no, until I thought to myself, *\"Hey dude, when you are an old man, you will regret not having casual sex with a stranger more than not knowing what could have been.\"*\\n\\nI end up giving her my number and she calls me. There were a few things over the phone that gave me a bad feeling. First, she sounded *way* too casual over the phone. It felt like I was scheduling an appointment with a receptionist. Second, she thought that we were doing this at her place. I asked her if she had roommates, and she responded yes. I told her that it made more sense to do this at my place since I live alone. She ends up hanging up. I am thinking, *\"Alright, whatever this all seemed too good to be true anyways.\"* She calls back 3 minutes later saying that she lost cell phone reception for a minute. This was the final item to make me feel uneasy. In hindsight she was obviously lying. The amount of time between calls was far too long for her to have just lost connection.\\n\\nShe agreed to do this at my place. I insisted that we get coffee first so I can make sure I am not bringing a wacko into my apartment. She agreed to that and I am feeling more comfortable now. She just asks for a ride, which was not a problem for me.\\n\\nI leave to pick her up and get $40 for the bud. Up to this point, I was feeling really nervous about going through with this. Then, while I am actually going through with it, all those thoughts disappeared. I am just thinking to myself, *\"Tonight is going to be fun! I am about to get a little high with a cute girl, play some Mario Kart with her, \\'watch Netflix\\', get my dick wet, and maybe even... cuddle?\"*\\n\\nLittle did I know, I am about to get majorly bamboozled. The address she gave me was not listed. I call her, she says just to meet her at the Rite Aid on the corner. This is when I should have known to back out. However, at this point, I am dead set on eating pussy. I meet her at the Rite Aid parking lot. She actually looks like her profile and all the nerves are gone again. She said we could expect her dealer to show up any minute. She gets the call 2 minutes later. I am thinking to myself, *\"What kind of drug dealer is this prompt?\"* but me being a gullible idiot, I give her my $40 anyways.\\n\\nThen she meets some dude on the corner and they walk off together, not to be seen again. I immediately realize that I have been played. She texts me, \"Ur beat sorry\" and that was that.\\n\\nWas I mad? No, not at all. The situation could have been far worse. It could have been more money. She could have been an undercover cop. She could have been lying about her age. I could have been beat up by her boyfriend. I could have gotten an STD. The list goes on folks.\\n\\nRight now, I feel three things. I feel great shame, this is not the guy I am. I am just lonely and would have appreciated some sexual comfort. I also feel really bad for her. She must be in a tight spot to have gone through with that. I am sure that she needs my $40 more than I do. Finally, I feel really unlucky, as yesterday was my cake day. If this could have happened just one day earlier, my post would have been gilded *for sure*.\\n\\nLadies and gentlemen, what did we learn today? If a situation seems too good to be true, it is.\\n\\ntl;dr I met a girl on Tinder who just wanted to get high and fuck. I give her the money for the weed and she just walks off with it.\\n\\nEdit: Just woke up, will try to respond some of you throughout the day. Thanks for all the comments and to whoever it was that gave gold! I know, I am an idiot. I don’t mind being the *butt* of a joke though because you people are absolutely hilarious! So this happened 8 years ago when I was 12yo. (First reddit post, that’s why story took so long to tell.) \\n\\nAt the time I lived in Moscow, Russia with my family, im swedish but my father worked at the embassy in Moscow. I was always fucking/playing around as a young lad. While in Moscow we lived in a quite pompous neighberhood with mostly other diplomats as well as russian businessman who often are pretty shady (as yall know).\\n\\nAfter school me and my best friend always used to hang out. I lived in an apartment in a big tower of a building. On every level there were two apartments and with that two doors. I lived on something like the 4-5 floor so I always took the elevator. Me and my friend one day ended up on the highest floor while being annoying and pressing all of the buttons in the elevator. That floor was being renovated, it was covered in plastic and overall looking kinda abandonned. The floor gave off a creepy feeling. As on all levels there were two doors. In Russia it is common that you have quite pompous doors with patterns and different materials. Rich people would flex not only with cars but also with doors. One of these two doors at the top of the building was hella pimped out. \\n\\nThe door was gray with buttons and made out of a fluffy pillowlike soft material, how I know it was soft? Well we felt on it. Me and my friend not only felt on it, because of its’ texture and the fact that we thought the apartment to be abondonned (yep) we made it a tradition to everytime we took the elevator to my flat first visit THE DOOR to pet it.\\n\\nThis tradition continued for a couple of weeks and one day we were hanging out at my place after petting the door when my father called on me. When I came to him he was standing at the door that was occupied by two big russian men armed with handguns. They started talking in russian which already normally sounds like an angry language. They looked hella scary with guns and they were both looking at me dead in the eyes while basically screaming. I had no idea what was going on (I spoke very little russian) until my father asked if I had been at the top floor doing suspicious stuff. \\n\\nThat was when I realized my fuck up. The russian body guards (my father told me they said that they introduced themselves as BGs) continued to lecture me for a while and my father looked quite amused. Then suddenly one of them started smiling and said something like ”good boy” in english before leaving. I stopped shitting my pants and asked my father what they said. He explained that they had seen me and my friend day after day walking up to THE DOOR and petting it in their surveillance system. I believe these body guards to work for some big time russian buisnessman perhaps even a criminal. I do not see why they would be armed otherwise. I can not with certainty say that they were gangsters but that would be my guess.\\n\\nThis incident was scary at the time but is a very fond memory from Russia today. I never petted THE DOOR again. Actually I have not petted a door since.\\n\\nTL;DR\\n12 YO me petted neighbors door in Russia and got visit from armed gangster body guards.\\n\\n(Written on IPhone) This sad tale literally just came to its bitter end.\\n\\nSo until 20 minutes ago I owned a gorgeous, bright yellow Death Grips hoodie that was my pride and joy. My mum bought it me for Christmas last year and it was my absolute favourite item of clothing.\\n\\nLast night I went out with my mates and happened to meet an attractive Spanish girl who was just in Manchester for the weekend. We chatted for a bit and made out in the club smoking area as one does, then after a while she complained about the cold English weather. I predictably offered her my precious hoodie at this point. Fast forward a few hours and we exchange contact details as we planned to meet the next day to hang out, then she leaves the club. I realise she\\'s still wearing the hoodie so run after her and ask for it back. \\n\\nThis is where I make my fatal error, a fine example of thinking with your genitals instead of your head. I had the smart idea that if I let her keep the hoodie for the night, itll mean she HAS to meet me the next day and can\\'t back out thus allowing me more time to charm her. I essentially used the jumper as fishing bait but didn\\'t think that the fish could just eat said bait and swim away. *spoiler alert* This is what happened. \\n\\nThe next day I awoke excited to spend some time with this girl and waited patiently for her to reply to my messages so we could arrange to meet. By 5 in the evening I start to get worried and message her again as well as asking her friend to reply to me. My messages get left \\'seen\\' for about an hour before they both block me on all social media platforms shooting in the head any chance of me seeing my beautiful jumper ever again. \\n\\nTo the Spanish girl who stomped on a nice gesture and on my heart, know that you have made me sad. \\n\\nRest In Peace sweet banana coloured hoodie x\\n\\nTL;DR Lent a hot girl my best jumper in an attempt to guarantee more courtship time, girl steals hoodie\\n\\nEdit: Thanks for all the support guys this is pretty insane, also thanks for the gold and silver! To everyone offering to buy me a new one, thanks for being so kind and thoughtful but I\\'ll have to politely decline. It would be too weird for me haha but if theres anyone in the UK that has one lying around that theyd maybe sell give me a message! x Obligatory \"didn\\'t happen today\".\\n\\nWhen I go shopping or order things online I always give a phone number that is one digit different than mine because I don\\'t want them to sell my info. By using the be same number every time I am consistent if I\\'m \"already in the system\".  I\\'ve been using this number for about 10 years everywhere from JCPenney to Best Buy to financial services, etc.\\n\\nYesterday I got a new client and he had the same number I\\'ve been using as my \"fake number\".  I tried my best not to show any emotion to hearing it but I asked him how long he\\'s had that number.  He said \"Oh, about 15 years, but I may get a new one because I get non-stop telemarketing calls.\"  I told him, \"I get some once in awhile too. Aren\\'t they annoying *haha*\"\\n\\nHe says, \"Yeah, I think maybe someone is giving out my number because they keep asking if {my first name} is available.\"\\n\\nI said, \"That happens to me from time to time as well, people think I\\'m {old homeowner\\'s name} or {bosses name}. Oh well. Email me if you change your number.\"\\n\\nHe says \"I will. Actually they ask for **you** pretty much all the time. What\\'s your number? I bet they are getting us confused.  It seems strange almost all of them ask for you even thought we\\'re not related\".\\n\\nI gave him my work number.\\n\\n**tl;dr: i\\'ve been giving out a fake number and met the guy who actually has that number in real life and he gets telemarketing calls non-stop because of it.**\\n\\n.\\n.\\nEdit: So tonight I had a meeting at the guy\\'s office to go over a proposal. I spent too much time reading comments this afternoon (and felt bad) and I told him my personal number was one digit off from his.  So he says, \"Yeah I figured everyone had misdialed for the last few years or this might have been your old number.\" He knew right away when he saw my name...\\n\\nSo, I never told him I had given every company on Earth his number (not knowing it was him) but I did tell him i gave the wrong number at Guitar Center a few times. Dont ask me why I came clean for one place but not the rest of them. He laughed it off.\\n\\nSo, I\\'ve learned not to give any more fake numbers and I did bring the guy a gift card to Longhorn Steakhouse as \\'thanks and take your wife out to dinner\" when in reality I felt bad because I didn\\'t think through my actions and many of you called me out. This was a few months ago, and I still lose it whenever tell the story. \\n\\nIt was a simple case, nothing special. With one of the surgeons who likes to converse with the guys. As I\\'m not one of the guys, I simply sit back and chart while half listening out for anything they may need me to get. Which I don\\'t mind at all because I\\'m insanely quiet by nature. \\n\\nOften with cases that last longer than an hour, we insert catheters to make sure the patient is producing urine still, and that they hadn\\'t nicked the urinary system. The collection bag is hung at the foot of the table for easy access, to assess the output.\\n\\nSo, I\\'m charting halfway into the case and all of the sudden out of the corner of my eye I see the surgeon turn toward me and he says \"You\\'re a skier!?\" I was totally caught off guard cause he never converses with women, at least who aren\\'t doctors. \\n\\nI momentarily stared at him, trying to figure out how he knew I was a skier and why he would ask me that.  I then proceeded to talk about how why yes I love to ski and I\\'ve been here and there. Used to snowboard but switched back to skiing. And so on. Then I pause and realize everyone in the room was just staring at me. \\n\\nThe surgeon then with his super heavy South American accent then sternly repeats himself and says \"Urine\\'s clear??\" \\n\\nI just about lost it. I said something like \"oh!\" Then ran to the bag to check and said yeah it\\'s clear. \\n\\nI had to leave the room because I couldn\\'t contain myself. I was crying. When I finally put on my straight face and reenterd, the surgeon goes \"So what else do you do?\" They had a good laugh. \\n\\nIt was super embarrassing and hysterical and it actually made him acknowledge me from then on. \\n\\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\nDuring surgery, thought the surgeon asked me about my skiing hobby,  when he really asked if the urine was clear.\\n\\n\\nEdit: I\\'m happily surprised so many of you appreciated my less than perfectly written story time! And I love the stories you\\'ve shared as well.  Just to clarify, I was crying from laughter not sad crying. It\\'s something I probably learned from my dad. I really think he should post his stories on here. Also, the surgeon is from a South American country...his accent is so thick that if I\\'m walking by, I have to try really hard to figure out if he\\'s speaking Spanish or English. That plus masks on top...things can get funny. Especially since he\\'s such a serious character normally. Also thank you so much for the awards ❤\\n\\nAlso, started my first day yesterday orienting in a new unit. I\\'m sure I\\'ll have more embarrassment to share! My friend (M34) and I (M29) live in different countries and we both aren’t native English speakers but we communicate in English. Of course sometimes we misunderstand each other but today this went on another level.\\n\\nWe facetime just a few times a year and today he called me spontaneously and I picked up. You could see it directly: he was happy! We had some small talk and then I asked him why he’s so happy. He smiled and told me he’s dating a wonderful girl. They are spending much time together and everything is perfect – besides one aspect: She’s a minor, everybody is looking at them and also his family is talking bad behind his back. But he doesn’t care. \\n\\nI was speechless. I never expected him to date a minor. He’s normally a reasonable person and knows what’s appropriate and what’s not. I asked him how he can date a minor and he got angry and said something like “she’s a wonderful lady just smaller”. Based on his broken English I assumed he meant “younger”. After some back and forth I was confused and asked him how old she is and he said 31... \\n\\nThen I started laughing and he looked very angry at me. I called him the biggest idiot I ever met. I just realized he thought little persons are called minors. (So actually he fucked up haha!) I was laughing so hard that he almost hang up the call. And when I explained him what “minor” really means he joined me laughing (and was also a bit ashamed).\\n\\nAfter a good laugh we talked a while until his girlfriend arrived at his place. He layed down the phone on the table, so I couldn’t see them. Even if I didn’t understand one single word of them both, their laugh in the end was hilarious. And then he introduced me to her. Omg this was such a weird but funny evening. I will never forget this one!\\n\\nTL;DR: My friend (M34) and I were facetiming when he told me that he’s dating a “minor”. We had an emotional discussion about it until I realized he mixed up the words “minor” and “little person”. He’s dating a 31 years old lady ~~who’s just smaller than the average~~ with dwarfism.\\n\\nEdit: so it seems like TIFU by writing a confusing last sentence. She‘s a person with dwarfism. Sorry for the confusion. Like I wrote in the beginning, I’m also not a native English speaker.\\n\\nEdit2: Thank you all for the likes, the nice comments and the awards :) Plus the amount of those minor/miner comments is mine-blowing! Well brethren, I too wanted to partake in the great Coconutting frenzy. Today was my day off and was also my wifes longest day of work. It should be mentioned shes on her period, and sex is out of the picture for her. I havent busted a nut in roughly 4 days, and the idea of penetrating a milky coconut somehow thrilled me after reading the whole coconut-fucking-bonanza today.\\n\\nI went to the store, got a coconut and a bottle of wine to set the mood. After getting home, I uncorked the wine to get my buzz on and proceeded to open the coconut via hammer and nail. Once the hole was set into place, I expanded it apropriately to fit my member by using some of the untensils int he kitchen. Once I got a good fit after doing a \"test run\" I found the hairs to be a little too much. I shaved her in the bathroom using my wahl clippers. The preparations were made, the mood was set, and I opened up a pack of condoms and went to work on my new bitch.\\n\\nFast foward a few hours later, and my wife comes home. All is well, we ate dinner and talked, usual bullshit. I knew I fucked up when she confronted me with the condom wrappers I had used. Aparently she found them in the trash can and freaked the fuck out asking who was over.. I told her I cheated on her with a coconut. .. It took a lot of convincing and showing of reddit threads to prove I didn\\'t have anyone else over and I simply needed a good couple of fap sessions alone. She was furious and I tried to console her by saying I\\'d never cheat on her with anyone..Just was having a hard time due to her time of the month and it seemed like a good idea. I\\'m not allowed to buy cocounuts anymore :/\\n\\nTL;DR : Fucked my coconut with a condom, wife found them thought I was cheating on her, had to fess up.\\n\\n This sounds fun, but I promise you it\\'s not and it\\'s ruined carrots for me forever. Also, obligatory not today but two years ago.\\n\\nLet\\'s flashback to two years ago, I picked up my VERY drunk (now ex) boyfriend from the pub. We were pretty early on in the relo so I thought this would be a great opportunity to get the boyf to open up and spill his secrets.\\n\\nI asked him, \\'Hey, tell me a secret.\\' and what he said next will forever haunt me to my core. He turned to me, looked me dead in the eye, and said \\'I like to stick things up my ass. I like to stick *carrots* up my ass.\\'\\n\\nNow don\\'t get me wrong, I am a big fan of carrots as a vegetable. Before \\'the incident\\' I would eat them everyday as a quick snack, and use them for all my cooking. I would say I would rate them as God Tier.\\n\\nAnd I\\'m definitely not one to kink shame, if anything - I froth a good kink, but something about the carrots made me sad. Possibly, the fact that I put carrots high up on the vegetable hierarchy and this seemed like blasphemy. The carrot gods are crying. I also suggested getting a legitimate sex toy for him, but each time I asked I was shut down with scoff.\\n\\nDespite the carrot-shame it brought me, I decided to support him on his carrot endeavor.\\n\\nHe was beyond happy with the carrot-support, and told me he\\'s waited years to finally tell someone. So flash forward through the next 12 months of my life which consisted of only getting him off by sticking a carrot up his crack, him spending copious amounts from our joint account on bags of carrots, and me coming home from a long days at work to see two soggy carrots in the shower with a sad bottle of lube.\\n\\nIt\\'s been a year since carrot-gate, and I still can\\'t look at one without shedding a tear. Ultimately, I think it was the carrots that ended the relationship. I was never orange enough.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR: I asked my boyfriend to tell my a secret and he confessed he loves sticking carrots up his clacker. That year of my life is now only referred to as \\'carrot-gate.\\'\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT: spelling & holy moly thank you for the awards and the comments - I got a good giggle out of them.  And trust me, I know the joint account was ridiculous - we were young and thought getting a joint account would mean we would be together forever LOL. Little did I know... So like the title said I fucked up (it was after midnight so technicly today) by having my period and getting drunk.\\nIf your one of those guys who nearly faints when someone mentions the word period, this post aint for you, It will fuck up your life.\\n\\nMy son’s birthday was yesterday, so I’ve been running around all day catering everybody and making sure the kids don’t break anything/eachother. Somewhere around noon I noticed my period got heavy and I put in a tampon, and went back to my guests.\\n\\nAround 7 o’clock everyone left except my husband’s best friend, I put the kids to bed and started to relax. I’ve had a wine or 2 during the day, and now with my kids in bed I treated myself to a glass of wine, and during the evening my husband and I got pretty wasted (which for my was kinda easy cos I hadnt had a drink in like 2 weeks). \\nAround 11 my husband went to bed because he got tired and pretty bored with me and his friend because we where talking about games, watching trailers, that kind of stuff. And since I’ve got no gamer friends I had a good time, getting drunker by the minute. Around 00.30 husbands friend decides to go home. \\n\\nThis is where my FU begins.\\n\\nI was pretty drunk, and drunk me tought sexytime with husband was a good idea (cos let’s face it, drunk sexytime is the best sexytime). But then I realised I still had my tampon in, so I had to get it out (also because it’s dangerous to have it in for as long as I unknowingly had, but most because of my desired sexytime). \\n\\nI went to the toilet, ready to pull it out, when I realised I couldnt “find” it, or the string. After some fumbling around I could feel al little bit of the string, alllllll the way tucked in. I spend about 15 minutes grabbing the string, trying to pull it out, only to feel like it was stuck, and I couldnt get a good grip at it. \\nI was getting annoyed at this point, fingering myself on the toilet in search of The Lost Tampon wasn’t the kind of sexytime I had in mind. \\n\\nI decided to call the HAP (I live in Holland, here we dont go to the ER for everything, we go to out “homedoctor” for small things like a cold, bump on the head, vaccinations, deep cut and so on. But outside working hours there is the HAP which is like the on duty doctor/ nurse for like 50 doctors in the area). \\n\\nTrying to sound kinda sober I explained the nurse my problem, she was kind but firm, If I didnt get the fucker out in an hour, I had to come by and they would extract it. If I would wait till morning I would have it in for 20 hours and that is dangerous.  That would mean I would have to wake-up my husband not for sexytime but for I fucked up time, and we would have to get the kids out of bed.\\nI wasnt gonna let that happen (primerely because Im the hilarious one in our relationship, and I wasn’t ready to hear “yo pussy so big, tampons get lost” jokes for the rest of my life). \\n\\nSo before this moment I was a woman on a mission, now I was Frodo trying to get this tampon out of Sauromons grip. \\n\\nNurse mentioned trying to squad or take a relaxing shower. \\n\\nSo here I was squatting in the shower with my hand in the depths of Erebor. Still not getting good enough grip. So I take the showerhead put the waterstream on 10 and try to flush this white torpedo out. Guess what, didnt work... this goes on like 15 minutes, time is getting scarce. \\n\\nDecide to lean agains the wall squatting, and I finally have the string between the tips of my thumb and indexfinger. I AM NOT LETTING GO NOW! While I pull gentely I push like I’m in labour, and what do you think, I finally pulled the fucker out! \\n\\nI felt extatic, leaned against the wall again in relieve, feeling proud about my victory.. sexytime here I come! \\n\\nBefore I leave to shower I decide to take a closer look at the fucker, wondering why It took longer for me to give birth to this annoying bugger than with my youngest son.\\n\\nI look at it, lying in the corner.. and my mind goes blank for a minute... then I scream.. I would’t have flipped out more if it was the wormy thing from Alien..\\n...Then the realisation kicked in.. \\n\\nI.PULLED.OUT.MY.FUCKING.IUD...  insert drunken hyperventilation.. OMG I pulled out my IUD.. It was just lying there in the corner like some aborted metal fishook al bloody and gross..\\n\\nIf you think my FU ends here.. think again.. Keep in mind it’s around 2/3 o’clock now.\\n\\nIn my panic I decide to call my mom (waking-up husband isn’t nessesary annymore couse sexytime is off the table!). My father answers the phone all sleepy, and I ask for my mom. “Well sweatie, we were sleeping, whatever it is, I can help you, no need to wake your mother.” Okay... \\n\\nIWantedToHaveSexytimeWithHusbandButImHavingMyPeriodITouhgtICouldntGetMyTamponOutButNowIPulledOutMyIUD... HELPPPPP!!!!  “......”  Daddy?  “......” “M. WAKE UP YOUR DAUGHTER NEEDS YOU!” \\n\\nSo now I explained to my mother what happend and she managed to calm me down, and said I needed to call the HAP again. \\nSo I did, got the same nurse, explained what happend. She consulted with her collegue, and asked me some additional questions to find out if Im oké.. \\n\\n“Ma’am, are you shivvering?” Yes I am. “Can you decribe how bad?” Well I was in the shower, and now I’m standing in my bathroom all naked and wet for like 15 minutes now, so I’m getting kinda cold. \\n“Okay, thats a good explanation, are you dizzy ma’am?” Yes I am dizzy. “Can you decribe how dizzy?” Well I drank like a bottle of wine, thats how dizzy I am.(Muffled laughter on the other end of the phone) “Well I guess thats okay also than. Are you bleeding down there?” Yes I am. “Okay sweety how bad is it?” Well I’m heaving my period, that is how bad it is.. “Oh yeah, I forgot, so that is normal also than.” \\n\\nShe suggested to go to bed, and if I felt worse I could stop by, the fact that I pulled out my IUD wasn’t so different than when I would get it removed by a nurse, altough she tought that that “would have happend more gently” (no shit Sherlock).\\n\\nThere is still the mistery of The Lost Tampon.. I think drunk me pulled it out earlier at night, but I have no clue.\\n\\nSo for not letting go drunken sexytime, I’m now not gonna have sexytime for a few weeks till I get a new IUD. And because I didn’t want to hear “Yo pussy so big” jokes, now I’m gonna hear “Remember when you got so drunk and horny you pulled out your IUD” jokes forever. Not to mention my parents now know I like drunken sexytime.. So yeah I fucked up today..\\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\nToday I fucked up being on my period, getting drunk, and wanting sexytime. Mistake my IUD for my tampon, ripped it out after a 2 hour struggle, and woke up my parents to tell them I fucked up because I wanted to have dunken sexytime with husband. I did not get sexytime, nor will I get it for a few weeks.\\n\\nEdit: Wow this really blew up after I went to sleep! Glad to see my drunken efforts brought so much laughter! And its kinda nice to see al the shocked reactions, makes me feel a little less dumb for calling for my mommy in the middle of the night! \\n\\nSome aditional info as requested:\\n\\n- A IUD is a form of birtcontrol, its like a 2cm big T shaped metal thingy which is placed in your uterus, on the bottom of the T is a little string that sticks out your uterus alllll the way up your vagina, so that they can remove it. \\n\\n- No thank God it didnt hurt (dont know if that was the wine of the fact that I gave birth to to kids)\\n\\n- Yes my funzone is (apart from some trust issues) okay!\\n\\n- Yes I’m fullt aware now that I didnt have to tell my parents I wanted sexytime, but drunken and horrified me couldnt care less at that moment.\\n\\n- I’m 32 year old grown up mother of 2, and yes I called for my mommy\\n\\n- I could have asked husband to remove The Lost Tampon, but I figured after that sexytime wouldnt be an option for him, and since that was the goal I didnt ask him. (Thank God, cause this would have scarred him for life!)\\n\\n- As for The Lost Tampon.. I have no idea, I must have drunkenly removed it earlier.. else it still dwells in the depths of Erebor\\n\\nThanks for al the support, shocked reactions, compliments, laughter, silver, gold AND platinum! This made my FU a little less embarrasing! TIFU By letting the cat get my wife pregnant\\n\\nTechnically this happened about three weeks ago since the test just came back positive...\\n\\nSome background: \\n\\nLast year my wife and I had our first child. It was a less than ideal pregnancy that had her dealing with weeks of bed rest dude to preeclampsia with severe features. It wrecked total havoc on not only her physical health but her mental heath as well. fortunately everything was all right in the end and she gave birth to our healthy 4lb 2oz boy just shy of two months early (who’s doing fantastic now). \\n\\nDue to the difficulty of this first pregnancy and concerns over COVID, we decided it was best to put off kid number two for at least a couple of years. She started birth control shortly after giving birth to be sure we had no surprises, but the pill tends to make her very sick and she wanted to lose weight, so she stopped taking it. We thought rubbers would be enough, but that’s where our cat comes in... \\n\\nOur cat is an evil genius. I seriously think the greasy orange little shit is still smarter than our nearly one year old. He gets into everything, and I do mean everything. No door, drawer, or cabinet can stop him, and if he knows where something he wants is he WILL find it. It’s so bad that for weeks after adopting him I thought there was poltergeist in the house because each morning I’d wake up to find every single cabinet door in the kitchen wide open!\\n\\nSo how did I fuck up and let him impregnate my wife? \\n\\nWell, my first fuck up was storing the condoms in the same drawer as the Q-tips, which he loves to get into and shred apart. He must have seen the box of Q-tips in the drawer when I put my rubbers away, because not even an hour later I stumbled upon a horrific scene of chewed plastic straws, shredded cotton fluff and shiny gold condom wrappers scattered around the gapping drawer that once contained them... I didn’t think anything of it at the time and just cleaned up the destroyed Q-tips and put the condoms that had spilled everywhere back into their box without a concern in the world. \\n\\nWe ended up having some sexy time later that night, and I vividly remember stumbling into the dark bathroom, opening said drawer, and blindly fumbling around in the box to pull out a condom (as was the routine) thinking nothing of what happened earlier. \\n\\nThat is until fast forward a few weeks to just the other day, when my wife was complaining of nausea and tender breast. We immediately shoot each a concerned glance as this ain’t our first rodeo, and she felt the same way before discovering her first pregnancy. She still had a half empty box of tests from the year before and decided to take one just to be sure. Followed by another one... and another one... all positive. \\n\\nWe start wracking our brains wondering what happened when suddenly it hits me... that damned cat. I ran over to bathroom drawer where I kept the condoms, dumped out the box on the counter and started to inspect each miserable little foil square. Sure enough, several had noticeable scratches, teeth marks, and even full blown punctures in them... which leads me to fuck up number two, not checking to see if the cat chewed on any of my rubbers weeks before when he had gotten into that drawer...\\n\\nCan\\'t wait to explain to my new son or daughter one day that they owe their existence\\nto the family cat!\\n\\nTL:DR\\n\\nI didn’t check to see if my cat had chewed on any of my condoms when he got into the drawer I kept them in. Three weeks later and despite our plans to the contrary my wife is pregnant, presumably thanks to my asshole cat who gets into everything.\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nI’ve been informed of something called the cat tax. Below you’ll find a picture of the offending cat in all his greasy, orange glory. I think the picture sums up his personality well. \\n\\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/eFHNFqo  \\n\\nDidn\\'t happen today, on mobile, throwaway account etc.\\n\\nMy job requires me to travel a lot between the USA and Canada - I have a 50/50 client split between the two places, so although I am based in Los Angeles, I fly into Toronto every few weeks.\\n\\nAll of my family and friends are also in LA, and I\\'m from a very conservative background, so when I realized at about age 12 that the thought of both girls and boys made me want to fiddle with my diddle, I kept the latter quiet to avoid being disowned by my father or giving my mom a heart attack. I\\'ve had plenty of girlfriends before and they\\'re happy, I\\'m happy and there\\'s no need to change that. Anyway.\\n\\nI headed out to Toronto last Friday morning for a few meetings. Every now and then, I\\'ll have meetings Friday and Monday, so I\\'ll stay the weekend and have a little bit of a holiday in a nice hotel somewhere.\\n\\nAt about 4pm on Friday, I had finished my work, checked into my hotel and was feeling a bit horny. Anyone in the bi community will know it\\'s easier to pickup guys then girls, so I downloaded Grindr, created an account, uploaded a few pictures (without my face - half because I\\'m ugly and half because I don\\'t want to be recognized) and did some browsing. Some 20ish minutes in - I got a message. This guy was about my age, didn\\'t have a picture, but gave me a description of himself and he sounded like a good way to spend my Friday night.\\n\\nWe start to make a plan for 7pm and he mentions he\\'s married and asks if I\\'d be interested in his husband coming along and having a little threesome action. Now a threesome wasn\\'t on my to-do list, but I\\'ll give anything a go once so I said what the hell.\\n\\nAnyways, it comes around to 6:30pm and I get a call. I have two SIM cards in my phone (one from Canada and one from the USA). It\\'s my cousin who lives in Canada. I only speak to this guy probably 2-3 times a year, so it\\'s a little weird, but not any cause for concern or anything and I was a bit busy at the time with some prep, so I let it go to VM. 60 seconds later, a txt. From my cousin:\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n*\"Hi it\\'s xxxxx from Grindr. We\\'re 2 minutes away, OK if we\\'re a bit early?\"*\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt took me about 30 seconds, but it clicks. Canada. Gay Married Cousin. The Description Matches. Holy fucking shit, I just organised a threesome with my cousin.\\n\\nI sat there in the bathroom, trying not to have a panic attack for a few minutes until my phone rings again. Now obviously I\\'m not going to answer it, and I\\'m just praising god that I gave him my Canadian number over Grindr that he didn\\'t have, and that I had him saved in my phone. The room phone begins to ring as well. Holy shit.\\n\\nI swear to god, I have never put on clothes so fast and bolted down 30 floors of stairs so fast. At the bottom of the staircase, I was straight through that fire door and hid in the nearest McDonalds for the next 4 hours. 14 missed calls (10 from my cousin, 4 from hotel reception) and I took the SIM card out of my phone and snapped it in half. Found a new hotel room that night just in case. Have to come up with an excuse for work and my clients as to why I need a new Canadian number, but I think it was better than the other option...\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**TL;DR Went to Canada for work, wanted a quick hookup, didn\\'t do my due diligence and almost ended up having a threesome with my gay cousin and his husband, ran away and hid in a McDonalds for 4 hours** So little backstory, to my knowledge  I\\'m just about a 8th Native American. My parents didn\\'t raise me spiritual or anything but I knew they did have a little shrine they liked to keep some things and whatever it was just part of the house I had friends ask me about and it was nothing crazy. They are also really fond of leathers and animal skins which... Cringe but anyway. When I got old enough I asked my parents what tribe we were and I was told the Yuan-Ti. Now I didnt know anything of it but I did tell my friends in elementary school and whatever and bragged I was close to nature (as you do). So recently I applied to colleges and since you only have to be 1/16 native I thought I had this in the bag. Confirmed with my parents and sent in my applications as 1/8th Yuan-ti tribe.  I found out all these years that is a fictional race of snake people from Dungeons and Dragons. TLDR: since I was a kid my parents told me I was native Yuan-ti but actually they were just nerds and I told everyone I know that I was a fictional snake person. Tonight’s booty call went horribly wrong. \\n\\nHorribly. \\n\\nHorribly. \\n\\nWrong. \\n\\nAfter almost a year of separation, my divorce was finalized this week. And what a better way to celebrate, than with a good old fashioned booty call. \\n\\nI had recently reconnected with a man I had previously had some playtime with. The last time we were together, I had what was probably the best sex of my life. So to say I was excited to be talking with him again was an understatement. \\n\\nAfter some basic chat, we made plans to meet up tonight. This next tidbit may seem like TMI, but it’s important to the story. My IUD does not play nice and more often than not I’m bleeding to some extent. Tonight included. But he was fine with that, so we kept our plans. \\n\\nHe comes over, and things instantly get heated. More MIND BLOWING sex commences. Hot, steamy, sheet soaking sex. We take some time to recharge and go for round 2. Not as hot and steamy, but still damn good. I lay down next to him, but under the covers. He gets up and starts getting dressed. We have some small talk, and then he walks over to my side of the bed and looks at the floor. \\n\\n“What is THAT?” He says. \\n\\n“What?” I look over the edge of the bed. There are two dark spots on the floor. “Eh. I’ll clean it up”\\n\\n“You know what this is, right?” He asks. \\n\\n“I’m pretty sure it’s...”\\n\\n“It’s not blood” he interrupts. “That’s not red.”\\n\\n“What??”\\n\\nAgain, he says “That’s not blood. That’s BROWN. You know what that is.”\\n\\n“No.” I stammer. “That can’t be. I would have known if that happened.” \\n\\n\\nHe just starts laughing, DOUBLE CHECKS HIS SOCKS, and heads down my stairs, and out the door. \\n\\nY’all. I came so hard, I pooped. Somehow, during  round 1, my body was contracting so intensely, I actually dropped two small turds. And since my ass was off the edge of the bed, they landed on my bedroom floor without either of us noticing. In my defense, I had just finished a round of augmentin a few days prior, and my stomach is still readjusting. \\n\\nPretty sure he’s already deleted my contact info. He’s given me the best sex of my life, and it’s most likely never happening again.\\n\\nTL;DR: I pooped during some of the best sex of my life. He took off as soon as we realized what happened. Bye amazing sex. Today was a lounging, do-nothing day. I (22) watched some Netflix in the living room while my brother (24) played games in his room and my older brother (27) had work. The evening came, my brother came home from work and went to talk with my other brother in his room. \\n\\nMy mom called to ask what ingredients we had around the house so she can pick up stuff for dinner. An hour later she called to let me know she\\'ll be home soon and my brothers and I have to dispute who has to help her bring groceries in. \\n\\nI went to my brothers, \"Hey, you two have to pick which one of you have to help mom bring groceries in. She\\'ll be home in 5 minutes.\" I walked away like I was so clever, not including myself as an option. \\n\\n\"Why doesn\\'t she help?\" I hear one say to the other. \"I dunno,\" the other says. \\n\\nA few minutes pass and the two of them came out of the room and approached me on the couch. \\n\"You grab the arms, I\\'ll grab the legs?\" \\n\"Yup.\"\\n\\nMy older brother grabbed my ankles and the other my arms. I made it a little difficult though, I stiffened (which is probably easier) and I crossed my arms holding my elbows close to my torso so he didnt have anywhere to hold except a poor grip on my shoulders. \\n\\nBeing the weak noodle I am, I couldn\\'t hold my arms in long enough. He grabbed my upper arms and they carried me toward the stairs to the front door. I half expected they wouldn\\'t bring me outside, but I knew they would go all the way even when I had no jacket or shoes.\\n\\nI didnt want to be carried awkwardly down the stairs so as we got closer, I struggled. I kicked my legs with little effort because I didnt want to hurt anyone, and since that didnt really work I had an idea. Risky. I lifted my arms straight up so my brothers hands would lose grip an drop me. \\n\\nI dropped slowly since he was still trying to hold me with my arms up (I was wearing a long sleeve bunched at my elbows) but as I hit the floor I realized my shirt had lifted. My sleeves must have been pulled off my arms, lifting the rest.\\n\\nIt was over. My ankles were released. \\n\\nI put my now freed hands down over my chest and feel my nipple. Yup. The brother by my feet definitely saw. I noticed he was looking away at the moment, but I was sure he saw when it happened. \\n\\nThankfully I am small chested, so I\\'m not as embarrassed as someone else would be. \\nBut it is still awkward to think about.\\n\\nP.S. Sorry bro....\\n\\nTLDR: decided not to wear a bra today. my brother saw my nipple. \\n\\n\\nEdit: I was home for the holidays from college, moving into a new place with my fiance this May. My brothers help support our single mom. Stop assuming people are fuckups 👍🏻\\n\\nWhy do people assume so many negative things lmao\\n\\n\\n*** probably will delete this post within a few days. It\\'s obvious, with my previous edits, that most of you dont read before commenting. I also dont know how this got so many upvotes but here I am. TIL that r/thatHappened exists #redditnoob. Thanks for front paging my first post, for the awards, and for the rare positive comments. ***  This was not actually today, but it was recently enough that I thought I’d share.\\n\\nMy husband, my cat and I are chilling and suddenly my husband farts. Large. Seemingly as a reaction, with perfect timing and a traumatized facial response, my cat gets up and ditches. I start cracking up and immediately text my sister “hahahahaha [husbandname] farted and [catname] left!!!”\\n\\nBuuuuut it turns out I accidentally texted my husband instead of my sister about himself farting. He opens the text and shows it to me. I am utterly confused for a moment about how he has this text. Then it registers that I texted him making fun of him and I start cracking up even harder. My pregnant self not slightly, but COMPLETELY loses bladder control. \\n\\nNow, every time I make fun of my husband, he says “are you gonna text me about it?” Or, alternatively, “are you gonna pee about it?”\\n\\nTL;DR I meant to text my sister making fun of my husband but mistakenly texted my husband making fun of my husband. I followed up by providing further fodder for his comebacks.\\n\\nEdit: Awards! Wow, thanks, everyone:) This happened last night. \\n\\nSo I\\'m a theatre kid at my high school and our first night of our play was last night. The day before, everyone on the cast was given brand new LAV microphones (the wire mics that you tape to your face). Unfortunately, I didn\\'t know this. See, the old mics were only activated by the sound director, meaning it only worked if a switch on the sound board was flipped. The new ones, however, turn on automatically when you pass a certain area on stage. I think you can kind of see where this is going. \\n\\nSo anyways, there was one part where I had to strip my costume (button-down shirt and khakis essentially) and change into a very pg-13 toga costume, then put my original costume back on as quickly as possible. So after I get up on stage, do my cute little toga thang, rush back offstage to return to my original outfit. Once I was offstage, I began changing directly in front of the door I had just exited. This was because I had forgotten that someone else had to get on stage before I returned. So this asswipe rushes past me, and with the force of Thor Almighty, and swings the door wide open, exposing my asscheek to THE ENTIRE CAST AND A GOOD 40% OF THE AUDIENCE. I freaked the fuck out and turned into [Patrick fucking Star](https://youtu.be/Kaqa2N_O-KE) as I ran to shut the door. Here\\'s the FU. \\n\\nSo here I am, half naked, shivering, super embarrassed, I reached out to grab the doorknob. I made eye contact with the guy who had just made me flash all these poor people, and I instinctively gave him a good ol\\' fashioned American \"MOTHERFUCKER!\". I swear to fucking god the door stretched as I was reaching for the doorknob, because next thing I know, I was on stage, PANTS STILL DOWN, and heard a sea of gasps flood the auditorium. Turns out the mic boundary was just barely passed where I was standing. So yes, the cast, the crew members above and behind me, as well as the 860+ wonderful audience members heard me loud and clear. On top of that, I didn\\'t just say it, I screamed, so that shit echoed and bounced off the walls like crazy. Here\\'s what it was like from the audiences perspective:\\n\\n\"Say, do you like canned salmon?\"\\n\"I\\'m quite fond of it, yes.\"\\n*door opens*\\n\"Oh, there he is! This is my husb-\"\\n*skinny Asian boy with red boxers waddles on stage*\\n\"MOTHERFUCKER^fucker^^fucker^^^fucker!\"\\n*door slams*\\n\"....Well....how do you do Madame?\"\\n\\nSafe to say I\\'ll never be in another production at my school again. \\n\\nTL;DR- I unintentionally flashed like 200 people, then waddled with my pants at my ankles to close the door, screamed a vulgar word, and became the most infamous theatre student at my school. \\n\\nIn words of the old Western prospectors: GOLD! YEEE-HAWWW!!! Thanks, Stranger!\\n\\nEDIT- ok I don\\'t know how mics work, sorry!\\nANOTHER EDIT- If you know who I am, shhhhh \\nAND ANOTHER- numbers.  Edit: **She may have said 6,000 years**. Replies here seem to support that it was most likely 6 based on the young-earth theory.\\n\\nObligatory this happened as a kid.\\n\\nSome quick back story -- I was raised in an affluent/educated urban area, but all of my Mom\\'s extended family are super country and live on farms. Most of my cousins are home schooled, but I always assumed this was just because the school systems suck there (they do suck). I enjoyed going to see my Grandparents cause I got to play with my cousins (only child) and spend time outside on the farm. We would mostly just drive down there for holidays or during the summer.\\n\\nOn one of my visits to Grandma\\'s, our uncle took me and my little cousin to a big gun show/flea market type thing.\\n\\nWe were looking through this vendor who had a bunch of fossils, shark teeth, stuff like that. I thought it was really cool and pointed out a fossilized shark tooth. Underneath it, the description said something like \\'this fossil is over 4 million years old\\'.\\n\\nI showed my little cousin (she was 10). She got this really cheeky grin like she had some big secret, looked at me, and very matter of factly said \\'This isn\\'t real, the Earth is only 2,000 years old\\'.\\n\\nI thought she was joking, so I laughed a bit and asked what she meant. She explained that she was 100% confident the Earth was only 2,000 years old, because she learned it in school and it was even in her textbook; therefore it must be true.\\n\\nI started explaining...well, science... to her, and she kept insisting it was in her textbook; that evolution was false. She grabbed our Uncle and explained the situation and wanted him to tell me how wrong I was. He got this really worried look, told us it was time to go and he would explain once we got back to the truck.\\n\\nThe entire ride home he was tiptoeing around the subject, explaining we are taught different things in school; and finally settled on \\'Well, God\\'s time is different than our time, so when the Bible says 2,000 years; that\\'s in God\\'s time. For us, that\\'s a lot longer, maybe millions of years. So you are both actually correct.\"\\n\\nYeah, I knew my cousin was home schooled, but had no idea her textbook was called \\'The Science of Creation\\', and she was literally being taught that evolution/science was false; and only what is said in the Bible is fact.\\n\\nOnce her dad (my OTHER Uncle) found out about the whole thing, he accused me of being a bad influence on my cousin (a year earlier I got in trouble for letting her hear a Jazz CD, and mentioning Harry Potter, which is witchcraft and satanic apparently).\\n\\n**I was never allowed to play with her again during any of my visits to grandmas, out of my Uncle\\'s fear I would corrupt her.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**TL;DR - Was forced to stop spending time with my cousin as a kid because I told her about Science.**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Edit 2: Holy shit guys, thanks so much for getting this to the FRONT PAGE of Reddit!** I never expected the post would get so much attention, but 9th top post overall, WOW!\\n\\n**Edit 3: Thanks for Gold Award kind stranger!** That\\'s my first gilding ever! A couple months ago, it was date night with my bf and I was PUMPED to finally relax after a rough week. My boyfriend (who asked to be called Magnum here 🙄 🙄so I\\'ll refer to him as M) and I ended up making stuffed crust pizza. With grilled onions, sausage, and a fuck ton of cheese, it looks fucking amazing. So does M, so while waiting for it to bake, we head back to the bedroom to do things.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAfter blowing him, I pulled off to swallow, but I couldn\\'t -- my jaw was locked wide open!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSuper embarrassed, I ran into the bathroom to get his cum out of my mouth. It was still stuck in the back of my throat, but I couldn\\'t swallow or spit, so I tilted my mouth forward to allow his baby gravy to slowly drip out my mouth into the sink.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWe try everything—forcing my jaw shut with hands, aggressively wiggling it, massaging, praying to Jesus to forgive me for my premaritial sins, but it\\'s still stuck wide open. Trying to make a little more tolerable, I took ibuprofen with wine, dumbly forgetting I can\\'t swallow. So there I was, choking on his semen, wine, pills, and drool uncontrollably flowing out of my mouth. To make matters worse, M eats the pizza in front of me, it smells delicious, and obviously I can\\'t have any.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAt \\\\~4am, we give up the home remedies and Uber to the ER. I attempt to explain my situation to the receptionist with my mouth wide open and drool dripping onto my shirt. She\\'s probably like, \"why is this guy taking advantage of this poor retarded girl?\" I write down that I\\'m nauseous and worried I\\'ll die from sucking dick and choking on my own vomit, and get seen pretty quickly. We end up with an audience of about \\\\~5 other curious doctors while this guy inspects my jaw.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOne asks, \"How did this happen?\"\\n\\nMe: ...\\n\\nAnother doctor: \"Did you yawn?\"\\n\\nMe: ...uh...yeah...\\n\\n🤦\\u200d♀️\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOne doctor massages my neck while the other one sticks his hands into my mouth and pushes my back teeth back. It hurts like a bitch—this guy\\'s applying his whole body weight into my teeth and I can feel his arms shaking as he leans into me.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBut then!! Suddenly everything feels right again. It\\'s all in place!!!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWe go home and the pizza is STILL good the next morning, and everything is okay. Well, besides having to send an ER bill home to my parents and explain that it was from dislocating my jaw :( M looked awfully smug the whole time, but I appreciated him coming w me to the ER and letting me drool all over him\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR: Dislocated my jaw by sucking dick. I had to go to the ER at 4am, watch my bf eat the pizza we made together when I couldn\\'t, and publicly humiliate myself\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nedit: wow this hit the front page, can\\'t bleieve this is my claim to fame About two months ago I was watching porn and found a girl who looked like my wife, which I\\'m into so I clicked on it. As I watched it I started to think it might actually be my wife, then I turned up the volume and listened close and I start to panic. It sounds and looks just like my wife, my heart starts pounding. My stomach dropped to the floor when she looked at the camera in this moment I am convinced. Luckily at the very end of a short clip there was a like a three frame shot at the end that obviously wasn\\'t her but I couldn\\'t get it out of my head. I kept watching and listening and slowed it down and with the exception of those last frames it really seemed to be her. Anyways after I finished my business I just sat and waited for my wife to come home, all the while telling myself things like it\\'s not her you\\'re being stupid. I couldn\\'t leave it alone so I tried looking up the actress but couldn\\'t find the info. \\n\\nFinally my wife came home and I had to show her the clip. First she laughed, then she gasped when the girl looks up. She started to tear up and asked if perhaps she\\'d been drugged or something. After further inspection and some comparison of identifying markers like birthmarks and the like we concluded that it\\'s not her but someone who looks and sounds extremely similar. I\\'m still trying to find out who the girl is because I\\'m hoping there may be some fun things to watch like a good lesbian scene. For a good hour there I thought that my marriage of ten years might have been a sham. The good thing is that it made me realize how much I love my wife and how important she is to me and my life. \\n\\ntl;dr thought my wife was cheating on me in porn movie, almost had a heart attack, turned out to be her dopplegangher\\n\\n\\nEdit; The shot is of her profile and for a moment she looks up, then back to profile and a quick look up again.  The whole clip is about a minute and a half long. It\\'s not a professional porno it\\'s a clip from a webcam show not at a great quality. Had the angles or quality been better the whole thing could\\'ve been avoided. \\n\\nYes, married men watch porn, I can\\'t believe how many people asked about that. \\n\\nYes I\\'m sure it\\'s not her. \\n\\nNo,  i won\\'t be posting the source. On the off chance someone figures out who i am, i don\\'t want give someone i know the link to a porn that looks just like my wife.\\n\\nEdit2; What I\\'ve learned from this thread is that this is a pretty common thing to happen.  \\n\\nAlso, to all the girlfriends in denial, idealistic 12 year olds and Christian conservatives.  Masturbation is not cheating,  neither is watching porn. Believe me, your boyfriends and husbands are much better off watching porn than being left to their own thoughts. You can have sex twice a day and still want to wank it sometimes. Just because you have a steak in the fridge doesn\\'t mean you won\\'t just want the ease and quick satisfaction of a bologna sandwich from time to time.\\n\\nEdit3; Nobody will see this last edit but i feel like this point should be made.  If a vegetarian watches a video of someone eating a bacon sandwich and thinks that it looks tasty and enjoyable,  does that mean they\\'re no longer a vegetarian? \\nI don\\'t think so.  Being attracted to other women does not make a man a cheater, that to me requires physical touch or emotional intimacy. If one can be condemned for their thoughts then there is no hope for any of us. Obligatory this didn’t actually happen today and I’m using a throwaway for reasons that will become clear below. A few months back, a young family member passed away unexpectedly. A social media post was put up about it, and it went viral. There were lots of kind people who commented nice and sometimes even helpful things, but there were also several with more maligned intentions: first spammers, then a few people who just wanted to speculate wildly about cause of death in very hurtful and insane ways, and then the anti-vax community descended on it.  The latter collectively wanted us to know that they “knew” what happened, that we could “understand the tragedy” better if we just talked to them. \\n\\nAll of this was a lot to process in my grief, and I started going through comments and reporting them. My anger level rose and before long I convinced myself that if I just messaged them and told them that the autopsy showed something 100% unrelated, that they’d lay off. That we would maybe even get an apology. As I wrote the first message, I convinced myself that people are decent and they just misunderstood probably. I continued writing to a few others. \\n\\nYeah.... couldn’t have been more wrong about that. I got back messages from each with different insane takes on it. Then I started getting messages from other people I’ve never heard of. \\n\\nAt the private, unannounced service, two women came up to me in the parking lot wanting to hug. I assumed they were from the other side of the family, people I’d met but I just wasn’t immediately recalling them, so I obliged. They expressed their sorrow, asked a few questions, and then began explaining that they had “research” that they’d like to share. One pulled out pages of handwritten notes about the dangers of vaccinations and how it relates to the deceased. Thankfully the employees of the funeral home helped me dispense of them quickly at least. \\n\\nI continued getting messages on social media and later learned that my info had been spreading from one social media group to another along with the any details they’d gleaned about the death from me. I eventually started getting phone calls even, though my phone number isn’t out there in any easy to find place.  One person went to the length to write up over 20 pages of “facts” about the death including a section on how my loved one’s death can further their cause politically. I couldn’t even be mad; at least she was honest in her intention unlike the others. It’s been months, and still I’m being hounded almost every single day by crazies all over the country. \\n\\nI’ve learned my lesson and don’t respond or acknowledge them in any way now, nor have I for a while.  I haven’t mentioned this to any of my family members because we’re all so broken right now and this is way too much on top of it; I just hope none of them are getting the same treatment. \\n\\nTL;DR Anti-Vaxxers have been trying to ruin my life since I tried to reason with them after the passing of a loved one\\n\\n\\nEdit - A few takeaways:\\n* To those that reached out with similar experiences, I have been mortified to learn that this wasn’t unique to me. Thank you for trusting me with your thoughts and stories.  I wish each of you the very best. \\n* To those that reached out who have also lost a loved one recently, thank you. Genuinely. That’s a brave thing to talk about with a stranger online, and it’s been really healing for me to have conversations with so many of you. \\n* I regret the user name I chose for this post and the wording of my TL;DR. I do believe in vaccinating but am sad to realize my words were a catalyst in spurring so much hatred towards those who don’t.  The people that doxxed me are on the extreme fringe of that group, and that has become even more clear to me reading comments and messages from some of you.  I’m going to try to parlay this whole experience of wishing for more kindness from strangers during a tough time to trying to be as kind as I can be to strangers (and everyone else for that matter),  online and otherwise. TL;DR I asked to be tucked in, got pummeled by a weighted blanket. \\n\\n\\nMy dude is a night owl I am not. I have a strict sleep schedule and sleep with a weighted blanket. Knowing my dude was going to play some Eve, I asked for some smooches and a tuck in. (No I did not replace the f with a t). We do the tuck in thing most nights as he likes to stay up past 11, I try not to so that I can function. \\nMy dude was a little extra zelous swinging one blanket and then another. He was the matador of blankets. Perfect arched blankets to fall so sweetly on my tired body. Until. Until the weighted blanket. 12 pounds of sleepy goodness swang into my face. Crunch beanbaggy smack. I have a slight redmark and a gut ache from laughing but no worse for the wear. I only asked to be tucked in but now I get to giggle about how doofy we are together my dude and I. I hope you all get tucked in once in your life and giggle till your guts hurt with some one you love tonight too. The male community is pretty split on the forest vs clearing debate when it comes to bums. I happen to like a well manicured booty. Normally, I use a trimmer with no gaurd because it\\'s fast and trying to manuver a razor back there is far too risky. I do this every couple of weeks or so.\\n\\nThe downside to this method is that it doesnt get super close and leaves a a little butt stubble. I was lamenting this fact to my wife when she lit up and offered up a genius solution. \"You should let me nair your butt.\" Said she, with a gleam in her eyes. \"Its easier than a trimmer and it will make your butt super smooth.\"\\n\\n\"Well, okay.\" Says I.\\n\\nElated, she runs to grab the tube, sits down face level with my butt and goes to town with a little more fervor than you would expect for someone tasked with rubbing cream on a hairy man butt. Marriage is strange. A few minutes later, I wash it off in the shower and we gush over how baby-smooth things are down there. I mean a baby dolphin would be jealous of this thing. It was like silk and rubber got together for a night of sweet love and produced an offspring. I finally understood what that Santara song was about. All was good in the world. Or so I thought.\\n\\nThe next day I noticed some slight itchiness, but I figured it would pass, so I just tried to ignore it and focused on not scratching it as best as I could. Later that night, my wife and I got undressed and got in the shower together. We were having an unrelated conversation, when I remembered the itchiness I had been feeling throughout the day and told her about it. \"Well turn around so I can take a look.\" So I turned around, stuck it out, and awaited her analysis.\\n\\n...\\n\\nDead silence. \\n\\nI turned back around to find her with her hands over her mouth trying her hardest to hold in a laugh. I craned my neck and twisted my body to try to get a view myself, and I was met with a horrifying sight. Like a thief in the night, somone had stolen the silky smooth booty that was there just mere hours before and replaced it with one that was COVERED in huge, bright red bumps. Unable to contain it any longer, my wife busted out laughing, while I jumped out of the shower to inspect it closer in the mirror. Overnight, it had gone from glorious, shimmering dolphin fin to 14 year old getting slapped in the face by puberty.\\n\\nMy wife maintains the hypothesis that it was an alergic reaction to the hotel soap possibly somehow exacerbated by the nair, as I did get a few small bumps on other parts of my body, but nothing like the warzone that my backside now looks like.\\n\\nI maintain that it was sabatoge because she was jealous and wanted to have the only smooth bum in the house.\\n\\nMoral of the story: never challenge a woman\\'s rightful status of smoothest booty. \\n\\nTL;DR: I let my wife nair my butt and now it looks like Freddy Kruger face fucked a topographical map of Utah. ** this happened yesterday and this is a throwaway account **\\n\\nI saw a young woman on the train whom I thought was cute. I don’t know how to safely approach people with the covid situation and I was getting off at the next stop so I made a note telling her I thought she was cute with my number and airdropped it to the name that came up when she took out her phone. She looked at me and smiled (I think, harder to tell with masks) and texted me as I was walking through the station saying that she thought i was cute too. I was excited! Then she asked me how old I was and my heart sank, thinking “oh no she’s 19 or 20 or something, younger than I thought”. I told her my age: 29. She then revealed that she’s 15. I was horrified and before I could finish my text of “I’m so sorry, I thought you were an adult, it’s hard to tell with the mask, I’m going to block your number now”, she said “i love ur glasses tho ur a major dilf” and I just about threw up, then collected myself and gave her a little spiel about please don’t say things like that to grown men (made it clear I’m not victim blaming), most wont but there are some who will act on that and that’s a terrifying thought. Anyway I think I handled it decently well but ugh that was brutal and I still feel so embarrassed. \\n\\nTL;DR I hit on someone who turned out to be 15, she called me a dilf, and I want to melt into the ground never to be seen again\\n\\nEdit: for the ppl saying “why didn’t you smash” and stuff like that, even if you’re joking you’re part of the problem, seriously think about what sleeping with a full on adult at that age could do to a person and don’t perpetuate or participate in that behaviour. Please! This happened the past night, technically already today.\\n\\nWe were having some adult fun with the boyfriend. It was also after a couple of drinks so we were going at it pretty rough.\\nSo here I am, on my knees, giving him a blowjob, putting my back into it when all of a sudden I hear a very loud *POP* immediately followed by one of the worst pain I ever felt. It felt as if someone stabbed me in the face with a screwdriver. \\n\\nThanks to my godlike reflexes I was able to yank my head away from the one eyed yogurt slinger before my teeth snapped together and with that momentum I also managed to slam my head into the nearest wall. I was already in tears from the shock of the sudden pain when I realised.. I can\\'t move my jaw. I started to panic and just kept repeating \"I can\\'t open my mouth! I can\\'t open my mouth!\".\\n\\nWe tried to pry it open while under hot water, thinking it was a muscle cramp but that shortly, with some pain I can\\'t even start to describe, revealed that it indeed was not just some stiff muscle... \\n\\nYup, I managed to dislocate my jaw while giving a blowjob.\\n\\nIn a futile attempt to snap it back where it belongs, I tried punching myself in the face on the opposite side, tried pushing it, pulling it with all my might but none of that seemed to work. At the end after many tears and pain and panicked running in circles, I took a painkiller and wrapped myself in a blanket to think through my options. I ended up falling asleep like that for a few hours. \\n\\nWhen I woke again, with the pain a bit duller and my mind a bit clearer I finally managed to pop my jaw back where it belongs but the pain is still very bad and I can\\'t open my mouth more then to fit a teaspoon neither can I close it completely. It being Sunday, only emergency trauma care is accessible in the hospital and it is insanely crowded so I decided to wait till tomorrow to seek medical attention. So here I am now, popping painkillers and eating my dinner with a straw, having absolutely no idea what I am going to say to the doctor or how do I explain to my boss why I need a day off in such short notice.\\n\\nTl,Dr: i went for a blowjob, ended up like the T-Rex after King Kong was done with it.\\n\\nEDIT/UPDATE: first of all... Holy sh** this blew up! I\\'m glad I could make so many of you chuckle. Also, I\\'ve read the comments, thanks for the laughs, it hurt.\\n\\nTo answer a couple topics I found in the comments: sadly, nobody came that day. \\n\\nWhat was boyfriend doing, well, he tried to call an ambulance after he realised we are not equipped to fix the issue. Problem is, my country is not very big on English and my boyfriend doesn\\'t speak the local language. First operator hang up on him when realised he is trying to communicate in English, second operator got stuck on not understanding the address code in English... I then insisted to \"f**k that, it\\'ll be fine\".\\n\\nI am not from the us, just very stupid. Health care is included in taxes but did not rush to the ER because they are under staffed, under payed and over worked an I was not bleeding, seriously disabled or in mortal danger, neither did I think a dislocated jaw is serious enough to require immediate care, tho reading your horror stories and warnings made me concerned.\\n\\nAfter a brief ~4 hours spent at the clinic I was called into a large room where five dentists were working on five different patients with not as much as a curtain separating them so the place was loud enough that the doctor did not ask questions because I was not able to answer loud enough. He instructed me to grip the chair tight because it will hurt, pushed my jaw backwards and wiggled it to it\\'s place. Showed me how to stretch the muscles, gave me his number and sent me off.\\n\\nHopefully it will heal alright and I can go back to finish what I was doing originally.\\n\\nOh, and bless those who noticed the username. I did make this account to post this story. Wasn\\'t sure how it would look on my main. A few years old but I still think about it with horror and laughter so here yall go\\n\\nI (24f) had my sister (30f) over for a bit and we sat in my room just chatting while I folded clothes. \\n\\nWhen she went to sit down on my bed, I immediatly remembered I had left my vibrator under the sheets where she was about to plop down. \\n\\nNo time to react, just realization then her face changed and we heard a silent *brrrrrrrrr*\\n\\nShe just looked at me and reached under the sheets, promptly yeeting my vibrator across the room. \\n\\nThis isn\\'t the first time my siblings and I have run across each other\\'s toys so we kind of laughed it off but the quick change from confusion to horror on her face sticks with me till this day. \\n\\nTLDR - My sister sat on and turned on my vibrator then kobe\\'d it across my room\\n\\nETA - Yes the vibrator is fine, it\\'s a shibari halo and very resilient\\n           Sorry for using the wrong verb I guess\\n           And my sister was more shocked than anything which prompted the throwing. This happened yesterday, but anyways here goes.\\n\\nYesterday, there was a Magic the Gathering tournament at my local hobby shop.  My girlfriend decided to tag along and come support me.  I ended up doing pretty poorly (1-3), but the hobby shop gave out a consolation prize of a random foiled uncommon card.  The card that I received was called \"Thought Erasure\" and immediately held the card up to my girlfriend and said \"AND I CAST THOUGHT ERASURE, BE GONE THOT!\" as a joke, but said it pretty loudly.  The shop is pretty small and a lot of people caught wind of my act and needless to say my girlfriend was very embarrassed.  We\\'re home now and she still hasn\\'t spoken to me. I\\'m fucked boys.\\n\\n\\nTl;DR: Casted Thot Erasure on my girlfriend and now I\\'m afraid it may have worked. \\n\\nUpdate: Girlfriend broke up with me. :(\\n This happened to me 21 years ago!So, halfway through grade 4, my family and I moved from Texas to Colorado. To help me get accustomed to my new classmates and not be overwhelmed on my first day, my teacher had me come in early and sit at my desk while the other students came in. While I was nervously awaiting the arrival of my new classmates my teacher walked over and gave me a warning.\\n\\n“Now, the girl in front of you is a dork. Please don’t make fun of her.”\\n\\nHearing this, the nine-year-old me instantly came to this poor girl’s defence. The teacher had just called her a dork, and I thought this was extremely mean. So I tried to help this unmet girls aid by showing our camaraderie to the teacher:\\n\\n“That’s okay, there’s nothing wrong with that. In fact, I used to be one too!” After admitting this to my teacher I was suddenly overcome with a fear that teacher would think of me as a dork forever, abandoning my plan of trying to help this girl I quickly added, “But then I grew out of it.”\\n\\nThe teacher gave me the most puzzled look I have ever seen and seemed like she was about to say more but decided against it and left.All the kids came in and sat down at their desk and I looked up at the girl in front of me and realized I had misheard what my teacher said. The girl wasn’t a dork; she was a dwarf. I had just told the teacher I used to be a dwarf, but I had grown out of it.\\n\\ntl;dr Misheard the teacher and then told her I used to be a dwarf but grew out of it.\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit: I got Gold! Thanks kind person! :D\\n\\nEdit: And a silver! Thank you! :D\\nI\\'m glad my mistake paid off 21 years later and become my most upvoted post! xD Obligatory happened a couple days ago\\n\\nI was enjoying a lovely morning with my boyfriend. Talking, cuddling, farting together... you know the drill. Just the comfortable phase of relationship when you no longer worry about being perfect human beings.\\nWell, after some cuddling, I noticed that his morning wood wasn’t gone. At all. And even though we had some amazing sex last night, I decided I wanted more. He was just so sexy, laying in his bed, I couldn’t resist.\\n\\nAfter some teasing, we went to do it. We’re pretty boring, maybe too romantic and really lazy, so we wanted just a classic missionary. Ya know, nothing too wild. But I want it quick and kinda rough.\\n\\nWhile we were doing it, I’m telling him to speed up, even though I know he is tired from yesterday. And he does.\\n\\nSuddenly, he tells me he got a cramp in his back. Okay, I thought, it will go away. It will be fine. It’s just a cramp. Let’s continue. Right?\\n\\nWrong.\\n\\nHe stopped. His face looked like he was in a lot of pain. His whole body looked like he was in a lot of pain. And he was still  inside of me.\\n\\nThen he told me:”Babe? I can’t move. It hurts. I think I’m gonna need help.”\\n\\nWell.\\n\\nI had to carefully operate myself from under him and take off his condom. I also had to try not to burst out laughing because of the absurdity or crying because he was in pain. \\n\\nThe best part? Trying to put his pants up, so he won’t be totally naked when the fucking ambulance I had to call will arrive. The whole time he was almost screaming from pain.\\n\\nThe REALLY best part? Trying to frantically get rid off all evidence of what we were doing just for him to tell everyone “Yeah, I did this to myself during morning sex with my girlfriend.”\\n\\nNow he is stuck in bed for a week and I’m wondering if my pussy was really worth calling ambulance and all that pain.\\n\\nTLDR; My vagina apparently feels so good my boyfriend got an acute lumbago in his back while being in it.\\n\\nEdit: Guys, the TLDR was a sarcasm and a joke.\\n\\nEdit 2: Aaaand he laughs about it now too. He was the one asking me to cover him so noone else would see him bare naked. He also saw this post before I submitted it (even told me to put it on reddit, because it is kinda funny) and is the one making most jokes about it. At the moment it was terrifying, but now he´s okay, so why shouln´t we laugh about it? I\\'m  a grad student teaching for the first time. Public-speaking anxiety up  the wazoo, so I decided to memorize my 17 students\\' names and faces  before the first day of class.\\n\\nBy  Wednesday of the second week, I had everyone\\'s FACE down pat. But  everything else in the classroom was an adrenaline-filled blur.\\n\\nOn  that day, students were picking out an advertisement to analyze  (flashback to freshmen college English class, everybody). When I opened  up the discussion, I was surprised when one of quieter students (let\\'s  call him David) told me he\\'d already chosen his ad.\\n\\nMe, \"That\\'s great, David, which one did you choose?\"\\n\\nDavid, \"The Wounded Warrior ad.\"\\n\\nMe, cheerfully oblivious, \"And why did you choose that one, David?\"\\n\\nThe  classroom suddenly goes silent. No one\\'s rustling papers or texting  under their desk anymore. I realize every single wide eye in the  classroom is staring at me or glancing uncomfortably at David. David  looks at me, and shifts his legs. His legs. With numbing horror, I  register the glint of metal between his sneakers and the hem of his  jeans. David doesn\\'t have any legs. In my state of stage-fright, I\\'d  somehow missed that one of my students is a double-amputee.\\n\\nThe silence in the classroom deafens.\\n\\nFinally, David, quietly - \"I lost my legs in the Army, ma\\'am.\"\\n\\nTL;DR - Failing to notice his missing legs, I publicly questioned my (Army vet) student\\'s choice to write about the Wounded Warrior Project.\\n\\n**Edit**: Many incredibly kind people are saying this wasn\\'t a fuck up. But I should have noticed. I walk around and interact with every student. Sure, maybe I accidentally treated David \\\\*just like any other person,\\\\* but he got embarrassing unwanted attention from everyone in the room because I was an idiot. But many thanks for the kindness. *Throwaway because only Reddit can know that my life is written and directed by Adam Sandler.* \\n\\n**List of fuck ups I\\'ve experienced so far - the 2019 issue:**\\n\\n1.\\n\\nMispronounced my new girlfriend\\'s name when I introduced her to old friends of mine.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nDropped an F bomb during an important job interview when I accidentally bit my own tongue.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nIgnored my broken tooth for weeks and ended up in hospital with inflamed and infected gums. \\n\\n4.\\n\\nChanged my Instagram name to @onetruegenuis and realized I misspelled \\'genius\\' when several of my friends and colleagues jumped on the chance to point out the irony of my illiteracy. \\n\\n5.\\n\\nUnknowingly opened a dick pic sent to me from my father who thought he was sending that shit to my mom. \\n\\n6.\\n\\nSpeaking of dick, somehow drunk me managed to get his poor balls stuck on his zipper twice in one night (the second time I had to call my best friend for a helping hand: I said no homo, he did not). \\n\\n7.\\n\\nTook a random ride on my younger cousin\\'s BMX bike, sat my ass down mid-ride, and was painfully reminded there was nothing but exposed steel to fucking sit on (tl:dr got butt raped by BMX).\\n\\n8.\\n\\nSuffered an asthma attack while masturbating in the shower and almost blacked out while waiting for my dick to defuse before I had the courage to call my roommate for my inhaler. \\n\\n9.\\n\\nVisited my sister in law who told me not to freak out if her pet bird decides to fly over to sit on my shoulder. The bitch fucking flew like 10 seconds later and I freaked the fuck out. I dodged the damn bird on instinct and inadvertently caused it to fly face first into the window behind me. It survived, but my sister in law made damn sure I didn\\'t. \\n\\n*To be continued.* \\n\\n**TL:DR A statement no one asked for reflecting half my fuck ups in half a year** Last night, after meeting a girl on tinder, I ended up at her place. As the two of us were making out on her bed, she wanted to know if I ever mixed sex with shrooms. I shrugged and said I\\'ve never done drugs, period. She looked at me like \"ooooooooh shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit\".\\n\\nFast forward to her feeding me an unknown quantity of shrooms and telling me how mindblowing the sex will be. I\\'ve got no idea when I switched from sober to losing my shit, but there I was, staring at the words on my t-shirt slowly melting away.\\n\\nMy tinder date, who was now in full fuck mode, wasn\\'t wasting any time undressing me. However, my attention was elsewhere. There was a hula hoop in the room that I didn\\'t notice before. I couldn\\'t help but stand up and use it. My tinder date couldn\\'t stop laughing at me hula hooping with no pants on. Not gonna lie, I was living my best life at that moment. I never wanted the hula hooping to stop. \\n\\nMy tinder date was not about that life though. Eventually she grew tired of watching me hula hoop and pulled me back to bed for some fucky fucky. We made out for like 30 seconds before I ended up hula hooping again. My tinder date got frustrated and tossed the hula hoop in the closet. She took off her bra and asked if I wanted to play or hook up.\\n\\nI said hula hoop.\\n\\nShe thanked me for wasting her time and her mushrooms before asking me to leave. Now I have to live with the fact that I chose hula hooping over sex.\\n\\nTL:DR Went home with a girl. Cockblocked myself with a hula hoop. As with most things this happened last week. I\\'m currently deployed in the middle east. We got off work a little later than expected and missed the galley hours so we stopped at the mini mart on base to grab some food. They have a decent selection mostly just your typical gas station food. So some guys grab cold sandwiches or microwavable burritos, I decided to go for the chef boyardee classic spaghetti and meatballs. Now you have to heat you food at the mini mart because they don\\'t trust us with microwaves in our rooms. You\\'ll understand why soon enough. I put my spaghetti in the microwave and set the timer.  We are just bullshiting in the mini waiting for our food when all of a sudden a loud bang what sounded like a gunshot goes off behind us and without skipping a beat there were 4 marines M16s raised yelling at everybody to get down as they make their way through the shop clearing the isles straight towards us. That\\'s when I realized I forgot to remove the metal top from the spaghetti. I had to show them the inside of the microwave now covered in spaghetti sauce and meatballs before they finally relaxed and put their guns down. I ended cleaning the microwave and buying a second chef boyardee.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTL;DR I microwaved a chef boyardee with the metal top on creating a small spaghetti bomb surrounded by a bunch of trigger happy marines Creating a really world close quarters drill. A little background: my girlfriend’s family is extremely conservative. Like goes-to-church-twice-every-Sunday-and-never-swears conservative. While they are really nice people, it’s a challenge for my heathen self to successfully endure a whole weekend with them without saying something that brings shame to my name. Onward...\\n\\nSo earlier tonight, my girlfriend’s family decided to play some games together. We settled on Drawful (a game that allows you to draw things from your phone). This is where things go south... \\n\\nAfter choosing our character names, you have to draw your character. Seems cool, right? However, this is my first time playing and everyone failed to mention that once you start drawing, YOU CAN’T ERASE. So being the funny guy I am, I draw this huge, veiny dick and secretly show it to my girlfriend in front of me. We have a good laugh because we both knew damn well that her family would be mortified if it showed up on the screen. As a joke, my girlfriend pretends to hit “submit,” on my phone. In reality, she REALLY DID HIT SUBMIT. Next thing I know, my character name pops up on the tv with a huge, contoured schlong. There was no mistaking this beauty, either. I feel my heart skip a beat. I looked around and accidentally make eye contact with her 12-year-old sister, who looks at me with a disappointment unmatched by anything I’ve experience before.\\n\\nI panic. I try to exit out of the game, but my Dick-asso masterpiece remains in the center of the screen. I stare at my phone to avoid the look from her parents. I try to pretend that I have no idea what happened. \\n\\nThe game starts and every round, without fail, my pork sword drawing makes it way around the screen. I don’t say a single word. The room is uncomfortably silent. I hear the occasional giggle from my girlfriend, and I’m doing my best not to explode inside.\\n\\nThe game FINALLY ends after what feels like a year. I select the new character screen and her dad says, “What? You don’t want to keep your big penis on there? Jesus would be so proud on this Easter weekend.”\\n\\nSafe to say my girlfriend (more her family) isn’t the one for me. \\n\\nTL;DR: I played Jackbox’s Drawful with my girlfriend’s family. I joking drew a huge dick as my character and my girlfriend accidentally submitted it. So there I was on the tv, identifiable as a veiny dick in front my girlfriend’s sheltered, conservative family...\\n\\n\\nEDIT: the comment about her not being the one for me was sarcastic. We’ve been together for almost two years. I’m just mortified to show my face to her dad for a while This is a double fuck up.  \\n\\n\\nI have this super sweet but incredibly obnoxious cat, she meows at the top of her lungs in an almost ear drum rupturing yodel that sounds like she\\'s trying to summon a demon. [This is Luna](https://imgur.com/a/HCfC8aL)   \\n\\n\\nShe does this basically for every reason possible, food, pets, treats, outside, play time, cuddles you name it. At first we thought she was injured or sick, so we took her to the vet, they told us that she is fine and just naturally talkative, and that we\\'ll have to suffer then he said  \"now please get her out of here I can\\'t take it anymore\" jokingly of course.  \\n\\n\\nSo here is the fuck up, I\\'ve resorted to saying, *shut up cat!* or just *shut up!*, little did I know that me saying this so many times would cause her to now respond to this as her name. So we now have to call her by ***shut up*** in order to get her to come......... so later down the line my friend came over and I saw my cat and yelled ***shut up!***, and he then looked at me like I was a total asshole, and said, \"if I\\'m annoying you I can just leave\" I had to then explain why I said that and we had a pretty good laugh, now I have to figure out what to do about her name.   \\n\\n\\nEdit: Thank you all so meowy much for the awards I really appreciate it, but please give your money to charity instead of me. Nonetheless thank you!\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nTL;DR: I told my cat to shut up so many times that she thinks it\\'s her name This happened last week. I was in a hurry to get to the grocery store pharmacy to pickup a prescription about 20 minutes before work. I pulled into the parking lot, walk through the door, and I hear in an automated, LOUD, voice, “THANK YOU FOR SHOPPING AT SAFEWAY!”  \\nSlightly startled by the unexpected greeting, I continue to the pharmacy at the back of the store. Multiple times I hear, “WELCOME TO SAFEWAY!” And “THANK YOU FOR CHOOSING YOUR LOCAL SAFEWAY.” And I think to myself how annoying this booming robo greeter was.  \\n  \\n  After I pickup my script, I grab a couple other quick items and proceed to the U-Scan to check out and I am constantly hearing this booming robo-voice. After I finish at U-Scan and turn to leave I see a manager speaking to the U-Scan clerk and decide to take the opportunity to tell her, “You guys have got to get rid of that robot greeter. That THING is SOOOOOO annoying!”    \\nThe manager looks at me like I’m A FUCKING MONSTER and says, “There is NO WAY we are getting rid of Sarah! She isn’t going ANYWHERE!”       \\n  \\nConfused and surprised I bit my tongue and gave her a look like like she’s crazy and go to leave, running the confusion through my head, looking down as I walk. Then I go to exit and hear the robo greeter thanking me for shopping, and I look up. Turns out the robo-greeter Sarah is a human woman named Sarah with ALS or some kind of similar Hawking-esque catastrophic disability. She was using a computer tablet attached to her wheelchair to select greeting messages for customers as they enter and exit.   My stomach immediately SANK and my face turned red as I walked back out to my car in shock at my own assholery...\\n\\nTL;DR I told the grocery store to fire their robo-greeter that was actually a severely disabled woman.   \\n  \\nEDIT - Just to clarify, I think this is HYSTERICAL now. I find great hilarity at my own blunder, which is why I decided to share. I’m not going to a different store. I have no shame in going back there at all. \\n\\nVisual Aid - https://imgur.com/a/pH9hxkC Writing this from the bathroom as I just realized what happened. \\n\\nHome for the holidays. My family got an Amazon Alexa a couple of years ago, and my parents never quite figured out how to actually make it work. It used to be set up under my account, but when I moved out last year I transferred everything to my mom. It’s in the kitchen, and she mostly uses it for timers while cooking. \\n\\nOur family likes off-beat Christmas music, and I spent a while some time back curating it all on to a special Spotify playlist for us. We like to listen to it as we have brunch and open presents on Christmas morning. \\n\\nHere’s where the FU starts. Yesterday I wanted to play a new song I heard for my mom. I couldn’t get the Echo to find it, so I had to connect my phone via Bluetooth. The family all got new phones a month ago, so there were no devices automatically connected. I paired my phone and played the song. \\n\\nThis morning, before a long day of family, small talk, presents and whatnot, I was mentally preparing myself for the day in my childhood bed. You know, relieving some stress.... with videos. Oddly enough none of the videos I stumbled upon had sound. I wrote it off as shoddy sources and finished the deed. \\n\\nWhen I came downstairs to say good morning and merry Christmas to the family, my sister greets me with “you need to play the playlist from your phone, I can’t get the Echo to connect to my phone.” “Okay, no problem, I’ll connect my phone.” “I was trying to connect mine, and I think yours is already connected.”\\n\\nNot sure what my family heard playing over the Echo this morning, but it wasn’t my usual Christmas playlist. \\n\\ntl;dr paired my new phone to my family’s Echo yesterday. Went to tug one out this morning in my childhood bed, and I’m pretty sure that soundtrack blasted in the kitchen for my family.  This happened yesterday but I didn\\'t really know how to explain it until know.\\n\\nIt was my university\\'s homecoming this weekend, so everybody was getting super drunk and just having a good time. During the day, my one housemate told me she was gonna be bringing someone home that night which I was totally fine with.\\n\\nBy the time she brought him over, I was in my bed trying to fall asleep. Her room is right beside mine so I was already thinking that I would be able to hear them, but I just figured they would try to be quiet. Once they got to her room, I could hear the bed creaking a couple minutes after. Me being tired and wanting to drown out the noise, I decided \"I\\'ll just put on my Bluetooth headphones so I can\\'t hear them.\" Now usually my phone auto-connects to my headphones, but this time was different. I saw that my phone had connected to something, but didn\\'t bother checking that it was my headphones.\\n\\nI opened Instagram for a nice nightly browse, only to find out that the first video on my timeline wasn\\'t playing audio. I thought my phone volume was low so I turned it all the way up. I was genuinely confused but began to hear a faint noise through the wall. By the time I realized my headphones weren\\'t playing audio, it was too late; the Monsters Inc. theme started playing extremely loud from the other room. I promptly disconnected my phone and I hear a bang on my wall following a scream of \"LEGOGH\\\\_, IS THAT YOU FUCKING WITH MY SPEAKER?!?\" I was speechless, I didn\\'t say anything because I couldn\\'t believe what had just happened.\\n\\nIt turns out that earlier in the day, I had connected to her speaker to play music and that\\'s what my phone auto-connected too. After the guy left her room, I tried to explain to her what happened but she is convinced that I intentionally did it. They didn\\'t even finish having sex because I killed the mood, and now she\\'s extremely pissed off at me.\\n\\nTLDR; accidentally connected to my housemates Bluetooth speaker while she was having sex and I watched a meme with the monsters inc. theme in it\\n\\nEDIT: she isn\\'t mad anymore, my other housemates brought it up last night and we all had a good laugh\\n\\nEDIT2: Broke it into paragraphs for an easier read\\n\\nEDIT3: Also to clarify, it was [the earrape version](https://youtu.be/IRP-2y43BLo) of the theme song Obligatory it happened a month ago. \\n\\nI started hooking up with this guy from Tinder. He lives with his brother in an apartment, and his mother comes occasionally to spend time with them. \\n\\nWe decided to indulge in a little herb smoking one Saturday night. The munchies kicked in around 2AM so we made some potato wedges in the air fryer. Came back and spooned to sleep. \\n\\nI wake up the next morning, with his morning wood pressed to my butt. This, for some reason turned me on and we proceeded to have lazy spooning sex at 6:30AM.  \\n\\nMidway through it, we heard his apartment\\'s main door open. Tinder dude stopped and got up, confused. I was still lying on the bed, wearing his t-shirt and boxers, which were pulled down to my knees. Ass visible, in all it\\'s glory. \\n\\nNow I was still under the impression that his room\\'s door was locked. I was wrong. His mother opened the door and I swear she had the same expression as the shocked Pikachu meme. :o\\n\\nShe immediately closed the door. I ran to the washroom and got dressed, and hid inside for a good 20 minutes trying to figure out if jumping from the washroom window would be a good escape plan or not. \\n\\nTurns out she came early to take the dog (who was in the same room as us the entire time) for her vet appointment. \\n\\nI left as soon as she left.\\n\\nShe later had a conversation with her 22 year old son about consent, and respecting women. She asked him if I was his girlfriend, to which he had to explain his very catholic mother that \"we\\'re just two friends trying to figure things out\". \\n\\nSpoiler: we ended up dating. Thankfully his mother joked it off the next time we met saying \"hi, I\\'m *****, Tinder guy\\'s mom. I didn\\'t get a chance to introduce myself the last time we met.\" (Chuckles). \\n\\nTl;dr: Tinder date and I got too baked and forgot to lock the room. Woke up the next morning to pip pip the diddly doo and got walked in on by the dude\\'s mum. And that\\'s the story of how my now SO\\'s mom saw my bare ass before she could see my face first.\\n\\nPS:  we never ate the wedges and he found them lying in the air fryer a week later. \\n\\nEdit: thanks for the gold, kind stranger!\\n\\nEdit 2: holy shit I can\\'t believe this blew up. My account is juuuusssttt 4 days old. Man I love Reddit. \\n\\nEdit 3: This one\\'s more like a clarification. I live in a non first world country where it\\'s fairly common for people to live with their parents/for parents to come over. His mom was supposed to pick the dog up to take her to the vet, and was being nice by not wanting to wake her son up. She had the house keys, which is again, fairly normal here. WE were dumbasses. \\n\\nCalm yer titties Reddit.  For those of you that are as unaware as I am, don’t wear shorts, flip flops, or hats into court. I went to go pay a ticket (expired tags) at my scheduled time and saw “NO SHORTS, FLIP FLOPS, HATS, UNTUCKED SHIRTS...” in bold letters on the door. Fortunately for me, the front desk had extra slacks on hand for this very thing. Unfortunately for me, the slacks were a size 32, and I haven’t been a size 32 since high school... I’m a big guy who’s been “blessed” with thick thighs (heard they’re in style). These slacks were so tight, I couldn’t zip them past the first rung. All I could do was throw my belt on, cinch it tight, and throw my shirt over it all to hide the undesirables. These things looked like yoga pants on me.\\n\\nI’d guess about 30 people were in the court room, spread out amongst the benches. I was capable of slipping behind everyone without them seeing and sitting on the back bench. One lady enters right before go time and asks me to scoot back so she could get by. I said “Ma’am, if I bend my legs I’ll bust these pants wide open.” She looks down, sees my pants and starts snickering, then steps over me. \\n\\nAfter the judge said his speech, he began to call people 1 by 1 as they said their plea. He allowed us to stand where we were and shout our plea towards him (WIN). Everyone before me requested a conference. I was fourth to be called. \\n\\nJudge: “QTVain how do you plea?”\\n\\nMe: “Guilty, sir. I would just like to pay my ticket.”\\n\\nJudge: “Alright, that’s 100 dollars, please step up to the front, sign this document and the officer will escort you to the cashier.”\\n\\nMe: *panicking* “Uh yes, sir”\\n\\nAs I’m waddling up to the front, it really dawned on me that I looked like a bum off a three day bender. Flip flops (that were clearly not allowed), the tightest pants you’ve ever seen on a man, and an untucked t-shirt. I’m starting to hear people fighting back laughter as I walk by every damn bench.\\n\\nJudge: “Didn’t meet the dress code huh?”\\n\\nMe: “Sir, these people behind me know more about my body than I do right now. I’d really like to pay my ticket and go.”\\n\\nJudge: “Ha, fair enough. Get outta here.”\\n\\nI waddled out of there as quickly as I could and threw my shorts on in the bathroom. Told my wife what happened when I got home. “Yah I thought it was weird you went into court with shorts, I was going to tell you but forgot.”\\n\\n“Thanks babe.”\\n\\n\\nTL;DR Check your local courts dress code before attending. I didn’t, and wore the wrong attire. \\n\\nEdit: Hey y’all, I get it. I should have thought about it. I’m just your standard law-abiding citizen who has never experienced the inside of a courtroom before. Can we not be so hostile? I was just trying to show the judge a little leg.\\n\\nEdit 2: I’m trying to respond to all of y’all asking me questions. To further clarify, I thought I had to show up to the courthouse to pay the ticket, I didn’t actually believe I had to see the judge. I was headed to work after the visit, and my job has a really, really lax dress code. Hope this helps, my fingers are getting tired.\\n\\nEdit 3: Thank y’all for the gold! I’ve honestly enjoyed chatting with so many of you. Reddit, you’re beautiful (even the random little shit stains that comment). I tried to respond to as many of you as I could. My fingers are actually hurting now. I’ll comment more tomorrow.  This fuck up has been going on my entire life but it just hit me last week so here it goes.\\n\\nMy grandpa is from the south, so he has a bit of an accent and on top of that he’s soft-spoken. This paired with my terrible hearing is a diabolical combination. Since I can remember, whenever he sees me he always has said “Hey! Wanna color?” in a really fast manner. Which young me always politely declined. Throughout the years this has continued. I always said no thank you because I have shaky hands and my coloring skills are subpar. Plus, maybe he loves coloring I mean hey, if that’s his thing then so be it even though I’ve never once seen him color.\\n\\nThen last week it dawned on me. He approached me and said  **“Hey! Wanna color?”**  At least that’s what I registered at first but then I deciphered it correctly. He was actually saying  **“Hey There Young feller”**  .. I  Instantly became red in the face in embarrassment. For my entire life I have been responding to my grandpas greeting with No Thank you.. I explained the fuck up to him and we both had a good laugh but man I’m never going to live this down.\\n\\nEDIT: To clear things up people keep asking how would I confuse the two phrases? He talks very quickly, quietly, and has a unique accent. So the two together sound somewhat similar. For those saying this is made up I guess believe what you want? I\\'m not sure why I\\'d make up such a strange story.\\n\\nThanks for the Silver!!\\n\\n\\nTl;DR; Grandpa has always said “Hey wanna color?” which I always responded with no thank you. He’s actually been saying “Hey there young feller”. I’ve misheard him my entire life. (Updates at bottom)\\n\\nI’m actually crying as I write this, so forgive any errors. \\n\\nAs the title says, I got the date mixed up on my flight. I was convinced it was leaving Tuesday morning, and so I spend Monday just cleaning up and packing. I was so sure I didn’t bother to properly check over the dates on the confirmation, only the times. \\n\\nI booked a flight to go home this month, because the tickets were much more affordable than winter break, and my budget is tight. I was so excited to go home, because I haven’t seen my family in months, and this week would have been the longest stretch of time. But I DIDN’T CHECK THE DATE PROPERLY. I’m so stupid. \\n\\nBefore heading to bed, I checked my email once more to look over the flight details and that’s when I noticed two updates, telling me my flight has landed. Thinking it an error, I double checked the confirmation and discovered my massive fuck up. \\n\\nAnd here I am now, crying my eyes out after having called the airline only to discover I can’t afford the only available options. \\n\\nAnyway, thank you for reading. \\n\\nTLDR; I didn’t check the date on my flight properly, mistakenly believing it to be for the 26th, only to find out hours and hours later that it was on the 25th and I’d missed it.\\n\\nEdit: Hey everyone! Wow, I did NOT expect this many responses and SO MUCH support. Thank you all so much.  \\n\\nI was trying to fly from Dallas to Sacramento (currently still in Dallas), but because of my FU, that’s not happening. I’m not sure how to provide proof, but I think I should hold myself accountable. \\n\\nInitially, due to my mental health history and how my family and I can be, I was REALLY shitty about going home (major anxiety, arguments with my sister, etc because who wants to face their family after being diagnosed with x and y and spending time in a psych ward). I didn’t realize how much I wanted it/needed it until universal karma and my own carelessness took that away. I just cried myself to sleep. \\n\\nAll of that to say that while I really appreciate everyone’s kindness and so much compassion, this mistake is none other than my own. If you STILL want to help, knowing about my initial shitty attitude, then I’ll gladly accept, but your goodwill may be better off with someone who deserves/needs it more. \\n\\nAgain, thank you all for being so supportive and kind.\\n\\nUPDATE: I’m going home! Thank you everyone for your kindness and love and support. I can’t tell express to you all what this means. \\n\\nI got help on the condition that I pay it forward through kind acts, and I absolutely will. Thank you all for showing me how much love and kindness there is to share. \\n\\nThank you so much TheGrayBeard!\\n\\nUPDATE 2: I’m home! I’m currently sitting in the back of the car as my family drives me home, sipping on a cup of tea my mom made and brought for me in a thermos. \\n\\nI just wanted to say thank you again for everyone who extended their love and support to a complete stranger. The positivity was overwhelming, and I will pass the kindness forward every chance I get. \\n\\nTo those who reached out to lend an ear for my mental health, and who thanked me for being open about it, I’m so amazed and grateful for the love in the community of people who struggle themselves and those who want to help. \\n\\nI’ll try to post a family pic (probably with the faces covered for privacy) when I get a chance. \\n\\nFinally, thank you again, TheGrayBeard. You are an incredible person who started an entire chain of goodwill. This didn\\'t happen today, but years ago. I worked at an insurance agency.  It was a small office with a receptionist and a few insurance producers.  We were a tight knit group and would frequently joke around with no subjects being off limits. Not your typical professional environment.\\n\\nOne of the producers, we\\'ll call her Lisa, had a boyfriend named Dick.  Lisa was a recent divorcee and her relationship with Dick was very on again off again.  At the time this happened, they were fighting and not really speaking.\\n\\nAround the holidays we did an office grab bag thing.  I picked Lisa\\'s name out of the hat.  I decided that since she and Dick weren\\'t\\u200b in a good spot and that she complained about how horny she was all the time, I\\'d get her a vibrator as her gift.  This thing was thick, about 8\", black, and had a gold tip.  \\n\\nSo we do the grab bag and everyone has a good laugh that Lisa got a vibrator.  We\\'re chasing each other around the office with it and having a grand old time.  As things die down, it got put on the boss\\'s desk.\\n\\nPicture the things on a regular office desk...computer, stapler, some files, pens, phone etc... and a big black and gold vibrator.  A woman comes in to buy a homeowners policy and says: I have an appointment with Boss.  Boss had no idea the vibrator was on his desk until he and the woman went into his office and sat down.\\n\\nThe rest of us in the office immediately realize what was happening and we lost it.  There is 0% chance the woman didn\\'t see it.  Somehow, Boss was able to stoically make it through the sale unscathed.  Neither he or the customer acknowledged the giant gold tipped dong.  More so, this was the woman\\'s first house and sales like that usually take a little longer as additional documents are needed for the closing and we would usually take extra time to explain the policy as insurance can be confusing to first time buyers.\\n\\nThe lady leaves and Boss comes out red as a tomato.  He\\'s not even pissed because he realizes how funny the situation is...and he still made the sale.  \\n\\nI\\'ve always wondered if that woman ever tells the story about buying a homeowners policy with a vibrator on the desk. \\n\\nSounds like the story is over.... not quite.  Lisa put the vibrator in her glove box.  A few days later her 8 year old son was rummaging around in her car, found it, turned it on and walked into her house rubbing it on his face saying: look Mom, I\\'m shaving!\\n\\nI think it might have gotten thrown in the garbage after that.\\n\\nTl;Dr: put vibrator on boss\\'s desk, he didn\\'t know and conducted business with customer. Then a 8 year old boy thought it was an electric razor and rubbed it all over his face.\\n\\nEdit: Thanks for the gold kind stranger(s)!\\n Matches the vibrator lol. Two days back, [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ael0wt/tifu_by_using_holy_sanctified_oil_as_lube/) happened.\\nHere\\'s the **TL;DR** from it:\\nUsed oil as lube, accidentally shot semen into the bottle. Turns out oil had religious incantations recited upon to ward off evil, and grandpa will be using it tonight on his hair and beard.\\n\\nRight after the post, a lot of people asked me to throw the oil away but I hesitated because my grandpa had apparently been feeling better ever since he started using the oil even before I came in it, so I didn\\'t know how to waste it. I could\\'ve asked the Imam (Local mosque leader) to do the same stuff he did on the oil in a new bottle, but he\\'s out of town for this month. So I just put the bottle where it was and he even used it once right after, unfortunately.\\n\\nNext two days, I stayed over at my cousin\\'s place and just got back this morning. Right as I came back, Mom recommended me to massage my hair with the oil given by the Imam as it felt \"soothing\". As she was saying it, I visualised my demonic jizz nuclei laughing and slowly sliding into the bottle, and then being mixed in it throughout. I snapped back, and acted like I wasn\\'t convinced to do it. She told me it was my choice, and that everyone in the house (Parents, grandparents and siblings) had done it and felt better. I rushed to the bathroom to check the bottle because I couldn\\'t believe what she said, and the bottle was nearly empty with the slightly bubbly end left over for me. I froze over the realisation that each of my family member had used my mayonnaise infused sanctified oil on their faces and hair, and I haven\\'t been able to look at any of them in the eye ever since I left the bathroom. \\n\\nNot sure if I should tell my brother about this now, or keep my mouth completely shut at this point. \\n\\n**TL;DR**: Came into a bottle of sanctified oil, delayed disposing it off and now my entire family has used the oil on their face and hair\\n\\n\\n\\n This wasn\\'t today, this was actually a few months ago. \\n\\nI get a lot of pimples on my face, not a lot at once, just usually 1 or 2 that will last a week or so until I pop them or they go away. \\n\\nEvery so often I get painful under-skin pimples, to the point you can actually see the lump in my skin, but no pimple/red/white head. I usually get them near my nose or on my neck, but this time I got one right next to my ear. \\n\\nUnlike previous ones, this one was not only extremely painful, it was also ridiculously big, I couldn\\'t stand to see it when I looked in the mirror. It had been over a week and it showed no signs of coming to the surface, and it was giving me bad headaches and earaches so I decided to try and pop it under the skin. \\n\\nIt took about an hour of unbearably painful squeezing but I finally heard a little *squish* and had instant pain relief. It was still quite sore but it no longer felt like it was going to erupt out of my face. \\n\\nFast forward 2 days later, I was riding my bike about 25km/h on the hill past my house when all of a sudden I just fell off the bike and slid down the road on my side (leaving a considerable amount of my skin behind) \\n\\nI had no idea why I had fallen as I wasn\\'t turning, or doing anything unusual. I hobbled home and put some antiseptic on my road rash and slept all afternoon. The next day I went to the doctor to get the road rash treated and dressed properly, while I was there he asked something that prompted me to tell him about my \"ear pimple\" situation. \\n\\nHe checked my ear and told me that I had in fact not popped a pimple, but my preauricular lymph node, causing an infection in my ear which is why I had lost balance on my bike. \\n\\nI was off my bike for about a week before I started riding again (and then I stacked it and tore my MCL, but that\\'s another story) \\n\\nTL;DR: I thought I was popping a painful pimple, but actually popped my preauricular lymph node causing an ear infection which then resulted in me badly stacking my bike \\nThis morning, as I’m groggily standing in front of the toilet to take a leak, I hear the familiar clip clop of a toddler running down the hallway, but it stops directly infront of the bathroom door. In the fleeting calm before the storm I begin to think to myself, “Did I remember to lock th.....?” \\n\\n\\n“Hiiii!!!!!”, the door swings open with a violence of action reminiscent of my time kicking doors as a soldier in Helmand Provence, Afghanistan. My eyes dart to the side, taking a last look at awful truth I’ve always known would eventually catch up to me. \\n\\n\\nI know my time is short and I need to act fast. You see, it’s not just the awkwardness of my child watching me relieve myself that I’m afraid of, I’m no stranger to shame, but I’d recently installed a bidet. This bidet is the lever controlled type and turning it on an off is one of the many destructive pastimes my curiousity goblin of a daughter enjoys. \\n\\n\\nWithout interrupting my stream I try to better place my leg between my toddler and the bidet controls, but she is a predator and instinctively recognizes this vulnerability for exactly what it is. Weakness. \\n\\n\\nShe lets loose a war cry and bee lines it to the lever, reaches between my legs and lets her rip. It feels as though time slows down for a moment and sad opera music should start playing as a mini-firehose stream of water shoots up at me, cutting directly though my own stream, spraying bidet water and pee all over myself and everything within the splash zone. \\n\\n\\nI reach to flip the lever down and pick her up, and in doing so, pee all over the floor rug, as I pick her up she lets out a banshee like shriek. The kind of shriek that activates my tinnitus, the kind of shriek that makes Mom worry and come see what’s going on. Which she did.\\n\\nWhen my wife shows up, all she sees is the aftermath. By now the bidet and my own spigot were off, and I’m just standing there, soaked in water and piss, standing in a puddle of water and piss, my phone in one hand and holding my daughter in the other, who is also soaked in water and piss. As my hands were full, yes I still had the ole clam hammer hanging out to dry like laundry that got caught in a Midwest thunderstorm.\\n\\nSo, however your mornings been, I hope it’s been less eventful than mine. If you need me, I’m gonna take a shower and drink some coffee.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR I didn’t lock the bathroom door like I should have and my daughter went Full Bull Conners on me with the bidet\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks for all the kind words, y’all! And for folks that keep asking about how the bidet is set up: [the scene of the crime](https://imgur.com/gallery/om1Ek9q) Obligatory this didn’t happen today this actually happened yesterday. \\n\\nI (22M) have just bought a house and I’ve finally gotten everything set up and established. My roommate (23M) and I planned on throwing a party with a lot of our friends to celebrate my first mortgage payment. \\n\\nWell Saturday night rolls around and it’s midnight. A lot of the people who told us they’d be here bailed for various reasons, but we still had a group of 7 of our closest friends.  \\n\\nThings started off innocent enough. We played some drinking games and got properly trashed. About 3 am we decide it’s time to turn in. \\n\\nI’ve got three bedrooms and some couches, so there’s plenty of room for everyone to stay the night. I set up one of my friends in the guest bedroom and my room mate’s girlfriend was helping the girls out with make up remover, making sure they had water, etc. Two of my other friends decide to join in the guest room and split the bed three ways. So there are two girls and a guy splitting that room. My room mate and his girlfriend go to his room. We were all pretty exhausted so everyone got settled and went to bed.  \\n\\nThe guest room is right across the hall from my bedroom, and about thirty minutes later I start hearing some noises. Specifically moaning. I had initially thought this was my room mate and his girlfriend, but it became clear that it was the two girls from the guest bedroom. \\n\\nI was still pretty drunk at this time. I needed to go through get some water from the kitchen. As I walked down the hall, amidst the moaning, I noticed the guest bedroom door was slightly open. \\n\\nWithout thinking much of it I say something into the room like “You can atleast keep the door shut if you’re gonna be doing this.” And I shut the door. That’s where I fucked up. \\n\\nI get back to bed and the various moaning and circus noises go on for about an hour. Finally I hear the door open. I’m much more sober at this point and I wanted to figure out what actually happened. \\n\\nTurns out my room mate and his girlfriend had joined in on the threesome in progress turning it into the first orgy in my new home. And I closed the door on my opportunity to join in! \\n\\nTL;DR: I missed the opportunity to take part in an orgy at a party I was the host of. This definitely happened today, though I wish it hadn’t. \\n\\nA bit of backstory, this morning the apartments fire alarm went off so we all had to clear out for a bit. In my haste, I skipped putting on underwear. \\n\\nI decided to take a nap a while later and when I woke up, I decided to just go to work without remedying the underwear situation. “It’s only a 5 hour shift,” I thought. It’ll be fine. \\n\\nI get to work, everything is fine. Happy hour starts, we’re prepared for the worst. I’m sipping my water in the back briefly and reach down to adjust myself.\\n\\nImagine my horror when I touch my entire ballsack.  I’ve never been so alarmed to touch my own balls. My pants, at some point, had ripped clean down the middle and The Bois™ were out and about. \\n\\nI had to explain that I was having a wardrobe emergency and ran to call my roommate who thankfully showed up with a new pair of pants and underwear. It was a long 45 minutes that I just had to pretend my balls weren’t enjoying the draft. \\n\\nTL;DR I didn’t put on underwear, pants ripped at work and my balls enjoyed some brief freedom. \\n\\nEDIT: [if anyone doesn’t believe me here’s a pic of the old pants, new pants and text receipts](https://m.imgur.com/a/rBdfcV2) \\n\\nEDIT 2: shit I made the front page, not how I expected the day to go given how it started. \\n\\nA few peeps kindly pointed out my waist size and y’all are gonna be happy to know w/ the help of antidepressants I’ve been caring about myself the last few weeks and I’ve lost 12 pounds by eating better. So yes, that 40x30 you’re concerned about won’t be a concern forever. :)\\n\\nEDIT 3: holy shit 3 silvers and a gold, thank you guys! I never expected this to blow up. Thank you for all the words of encouragement and hilarious comments, I stayed up waaay too late last night reading them. \\n\\nTo answer a common question: I’m very gay, my roommate is not a dude, and we’re definitely not fucking. We’re just best friends. \\n\\nAlso to the guys who thought I was a girl: I’m sorry you couldn’t jerk off to my post. I drove my wife’s van to work to save miles on the lease. I parked it, and she has the keyless start so I just left the keys right in the car (who’s going to steal a car out of my work parking lot after all). \\n\\nAnyway, at lunch I like to drive over to our other building that’s down the street to play pool with some buddy’s. I did that, stayed for about 45 mins and headed back. But, as I was driving back I noticed that the car was pretty clean, and my wife’s car is usually pretty messy. She must have cleaned it I thought. As I looked around to observe the rest of the newly cleaned auto, out of my peripheral I caught a glimpse of something in the back seat...”What is that??” my brain said to me. I looked back, and it’s a car seat...A car seat??...My youngest son is 7!! We don’t have a car seat!! What’s happening?!!?...And as the adrenaline rushes through my veins, I finally realize, I’m in the wrong car!!!! \\n\\nI got in a van, that is the same color, yr/make/model as my wife’s, parked 3 spaces over from mine, and ALSO left their keyless keys in their car!!!! I just drove someone else’s car away for 45 minutes!! \\n\\nAs I pull into the parking lot I half expect there to be police waiting for me. I pray that the spot is still open, but of course it isn’t. I find a spot that’s relatively close. I have no choice but to confess my sins, so I go right to security and tell them what happened. The security girl bursts out laughing in my face. But, tells me to give her the plate number and she’ll email the person and tell them what happened.\\n\\nI never heard about it again from the car owner or security. But I told people at my work about it, and people still say “Are you sure you got the right car!” And think they’re the only ones to say it.\\n\\n***this was a few months ago btw, I just realized it fit pretty good here.***\\n\\nI took a video in the car right after I realized what happened if you want to see https://youtu.be/jofnk-QkioA\\n\\nTL; DR I accidentally got in the wrong car at work and drove away in it (push start with keys in it). Kept it for 45 minutes and then realized it and returned. Told security on myself.\\n\\n***Edit*** Wow didn’t expect this! I’ve done WAY stupider shit too, so maybe I have a future here. Thanks to all who posted positive stuff and hope you had a laugh. And, thank you to those who gave awards, I’m humbled. Couple things I’d like to address from the comments:\\n\\n- I don’t consider myself dumb just very trusting and borderline gullible. That being said most dumb people don’t know they’re dumb so who knows. \\n- I don’t always leave the keys in the car but my work has cameras everywhere and is located in one of the safest cities in America so I rolled the dice I guess. \\n- To the dude that called me Ethan Klein, well done my friend that one stung lol. \\n- To the lovely ladies (Or gentleman maybe idk) who complemented my eyelashes or asked if they were natural...Thanks! All natural! Standard issue from Yahweh ;)\\n- People concerned about lack of seatbelt or distracted driving...YOU ARE RIGHT...Yes I was driving slow in a corporate parkway but still no excuse. All I can say is I was out of sorts given the circumstances and was genuinely looking for help from my buddies at work (who video was for).\\n- For the record, leaving your keys in your car DOES NOT void your insurance policy. That’s an old husbands tale. \\n- Thanks to those who checked out my YouTube channel and gave it some love...There’s some lame shit on there but some ok shit too...Balanced shit, is how I would describe it. \\n- Ok 15 minutes is just about up so in closing I’ll say this...Most people’s breath stinks at any given time (including mine) so just like, be cognizant of that. \\n\\nPeace! Edit: Just for a bit of clarity on the situation. I offered to pay as much as I could and she kindly said no it\\'s all good.\\n\\nI should have been more specific, her two front teeth were both really badly chipped to the point that you could barely see the base of the teeth there.\\n\\nShe\\'s upset about the whole thing but has a very positive outlook on it, I\\'ve offered to help cover payments but she has politely declined.\\n\\n\\n\\nThis just happened a couple hours ago. Just a bit of context to start out. \\n\\nI\\'m moving into a flat with some great people in a couple of months and they invited me around for a few drinks as it was one of their birthdays. It was a bunch of about 20 of us and it was kind of a who knows who type situation.\\n\\nIt was a great time, everyone was getting along well, quite a few drinks, dancing, the usual stuff. Met this girl called Jess (not real name) and we got talking and she had the most amazing teeth and smile I\\'ve probably ever seen. \\n\\nFast forward a couple of hours and we are all heading home, I\\'m pretty bad with women so classic me I don\\'t make a move and just start walking home. It\\'s about a 20 minute walk across town so nothing too bad but not ideal.\\n\\nWe leave at the same time and we find out we can kind of walk halfway home and split ways there. We\\'re stumbling along with some playful banter and she jokingly tries to trip me up, I\\'m drunk but not that bad so I manage not to slam the concrete.\\nIn return I jokingly trip her up and here\\'s the TIFU. She falls like a 20 metre tall tree straight as a pole and slams the concrete. I feel so bad and instantly picked her up, she has a bloody nose and I\\'m freaking out because I\\'ve just slammed this Gorgeous girl into the ground.\\n\\nShe gets up, asks is her face okay and as she says it, I see her two front teeth are BOTH missing. My heart sank. I felt terrible. Never felt so bad in my life. I let her know the situation and she bursts out crying. \\n\\nI call an ambulance and we got to A&E where we sit for 4 hours waiting to be seen to be eventually told go home and go to the dentist tomorrow. In the 4 hours we did get to know each other relatively well considering the situation. I had a mixture of feeling terrible but also how the fuck does this happen. You only ever hear of these stories\\n\\nI pay for the taxis home as it\\'s the least I can do and take her in and she invited me in for a tea with her face still fucked up. We chat for a couple hours about random stuff and as I leave I say it\\'d be cool to hang out sometime and she actually agrees to it once but once her face is in better shape \\n\\nTLDR: Went to drinks, tripped up attractive Lady. Went to A&E got to know each other really well. Now who knows what\\'ll happen Long story short, my girlfriend (18) is getting her license next week so I have to pick her up to go to my house and drop her back off at her place (40 min round trip).\\n\\nLast night I dropped her off at midnight and she wanted me to stay since I had work at 6AM and my workplace is down the street from her house.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I regularly shower together at her house. She woke up and told me she was going to take a shower, and left the room, thinking I was going to sleep a little longer. To surprise her, I slyly walked into the bathroom and stripped naked. She was humming in the shower and I thought it’d be funny to scare her, so I opened the shower curtain, penor hanging loose, and yelled “surprise!!!” To my shock, it was her sister, and she screamed at the top of her lungs. I stood there for a second trying to process what was going on and just yelled sorry and ran out butt naked.\\n\\nMy girlfriend was in the kitchen and thought it was hilarious when I explained, but her sister and I haven’t made eye contact since and haven’t said a word to each other. Fml.\\n\\nTl;dr - walked in on my girlfriend’s sister naked in the shower thinking it was my girlfriend.\\n\\nEdit: She’s 18 as well.\\n\\nEdit 2: A lot of people have posted questions so I’ll answer them here. Her dad isn’t really involved in her life and doesn’t care what she does. She’s turning 19 next month and her sister recently turned 18. Her mom is really chill about us showering and having sex, they even talk about our sex life together which is pretty weird but my girlfriend is really close to her and her mom loves me. Her mom is catholic but not very strict about her religious views and doesn’t force her religion upon her kids. TLDR at bottom\\n\\nConfusing title but it’ll make sense later on. Me and my mom were planning to travel back to Asia to attend my sisters wedding pre COVID and noticed that my green card was gonna expire soon. Since it’s already long overdue, why don’t we just go ahead and file for my US citizenship. That was the exactly one year ago.\\n\\nWell finally after one year, I finally got my letter for the interview on November 3rd. My interview was at 10:15 am so I made sure to get up early and arrive by 9:30 am. By the time I get past the security and get my information sorted, I’m finally waiting for the interviewer to call my name. It’s about 10:30 am at this point and I’m way past nervous. \\n\\nI finally get called and we head over to his office. Get all my documents out for him and we begin with the civics test. Basically out of 100 questions, they ask 10 and you have to get 6 correct to pass. Easy enough. Next he asks about my current address, phone number, and finally if any of my parents were citizens. This is where the major fuck up begins. \\n\\nI had told him my mom was a US Citizen through Naturalization and my dad was not. He asked how old I was and told him around 13-14. Well, he told me that under [INA 320](http://myattorneyusa.com/deriving-citizenship-through-parents-after-birth)  if one parent is already a citizen, and the child is under 18 during that time, the child is automatically a US Citizen. \\n\\nSo with that all the time and effort I took, I was already a US citizen. I was speechless, embarrassed, and felt I had wasted everyone’s time. The guy who was interviewing me was nice enough to go ahead and continue with the interview and later told me what I could do next to get my US passport.\\n\\nTLDR- Applied to be a US citizen, already a citizen. I am a fairly new owner of the iPhone.  This happened about 45 minutes ago....\\n\\nI’m in the bath tub (straight man, takes baths), i usually read on my device while laying in the water, but with the new phone I decided to start organizing apps.\\n\\nAs I begin to move apps I’m also trying out some of the new ones I’ve never seen.  Reminders, compass, voice memos, the bullshit extra stuff you can’t delete.  \\n\\nI run across the measuring tool and start testing it out.  How far am I from the door.  How tall is the room.... then I decide to use it on my floating penis log.\\n\\nAs in doing this, of fucking course,  my wife walks into the bathroom.  She never knocks, and I don’t expect her to.  I freak out as I have the camera pointed at my dick... and the live view on the screen is on.... so she knows it’s photo mode.\\n\\nShe leaves.  I text her and tell her “it wasn’t what you think”.  She laughs and tells me to send her the pictures.  I send her a screen shot of the app, including dick length... so she’ll never forget what 11” looks like.  Okay that part was a joke.  But she was a good sport about it.\\n\\nTL;DR using iPhone measuring app in bath tub, got caught by wife thinking I was doing dick pics Alt because this embarrassing for her and for me, and she follows my actual reddit account. \\n\\nAnyways, my girlfriend and I have been dating for a while now, but we moved to opposite sides of the US to attend college. We would have been together for college too but stanford gave me that fat L. This wasn’t too big of a deal freshman year since we still had summer and winter break to see each other, but starting last year things got really busy for us. I went with my parents when they flew back to China for a family emergency, and then over the summer, we both had work to do in completely different places. The only time we got to be with each other was over spring break. \\n\\nFast forward to our current school year and we again missed the opportunity to hang out over winter break, so by the time I fly out to the Bay Area to go visit her over spring break, it had literally been an entire year since I’ve even held hands with her. Naturally, being stressed college kiddos with pent-up sexual desire, we sought release as soon as possible. So the morning after I arrived, we have sex. She has always been one to like rough sex, and in particular, she loves getting choked. So of course I oblige her and unwittingly, I leave a bunch of very obvious, VERY red and angry looking marks on her neck and on her arms from pinning her down. Well we just casually cleaned up afterwards and went down to the kitchen in her dorm to make breakfast without really thinking about the marks.\\n\\nI sat down at a table, and she went into the kitchen to grab a bagel or something, when like six of her housemates also came down to get breakfast. I guess I have a kind of angry disposition immediately after I have sex, since one of her friends asks if I’m doing fine, before heading into the kitchen as well. It’s at this point that they also see my girlfriend, who is not with an angry-looking me, and who has red hand marks on both her body and her neck. Well they put two and two together and soon, I see them whisk my girlfriend away, while one person comes to angrily ask me about why I was physically assaulting my girlfriend, while threatening to call the police and campus pubsafe. I naturally, have no clue what they’re talking about and I can hear my girlfriend being questioned at the same time. The person who was talking to me begins to shout some stuff at me, and it doesn’t take long before a few sleepy people start drifting out of their rooms and towards us to investigate. At this point, I’m guessing my girlfriend’s friends offered to her to get pubsafe involved as well, because she dashes over to where I was sitting and begins to frantically explain to the small crowd gathered in the kitchen area what exactly had happened. She basically told a good portion of her housemates that she has a thing for rough sex, and that she had merely asked me to choke her while doing to do, much to the embarrassment of everyone listening, and to the two of us. Extolling the details of your sex life to the public generally isn’t one’s proudest moment. Afterwards, we both got a few very red-faces apologies, and she quietly ate her bagel.\\n\\nTL;DR: Choked girlfriend too hard during sex, nearly got reported to the police as a domestic abuser and then had to sit and listen as girlfriend told her dorm what our sex is like. So this actually happened today.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I were sitting on the couch, and I had to get up to do something. As I stood up, she turned me around, and went about undoing my pants. I\\'m thinking to myself \\'cool, unexpected sexytime!\\'\\n\\nShe gets my pants undone, and slides them down. Next, she pulls my undies down too, revealing the villain of our story. As she leans forward to kiss my stomach, my dick touches her upper chest, and, like an asshole, delivers a static shock.\\n\\nMy girlfriend recoils a bit, and says something to the effect of \"Nope, guess not.\" She proceeds to put my dick back where it came from as I stand there, still in disbelief at how thoroughly I was just betrayed by my own manhood. No sexytime for me I guess.\\n\\nTL;DR: My gf tried to initiate sexytime, and my dick shocked her; she changed her mind. \\n\\n\\nThis just happened tonight and I hope to never have to face the concequences.\\n\\nI work the night shift in a hotel. This basically means I\\'m a glorified housekeeper who occasionally has to check in some people.\\n\\nEarlier this evening I checked in a couple. Nothing out of the ordinary; it\\'s a slow night. The couple settles into their room while I continue mopping the restaurant.\\n\\nAbout an hour later this couple comes back down to the reception asking if I could help them with their airco. \\nBeing the helpful guy I am (and because it\\'s my job), I follow them to their room only to find the electronic panel that should control the airco being broken.\\n\\nNo worries, we still have plenty free rooms now due to the intervention of some unknown virus...\\n\\nSo I check my paperwork and spot that room number 43 is still vacant.\\nI ask the couple to get everything out of their room and wait at the reception, while I would chack if the airco in that room is functioning properly.\\n\\nI leave them to it and make my way to room 34. I open the door with my keycard and, when I hastily stepped into the room, was quite surprised to find the lights were already on. \\nThat surprise very quickly turned to horror as I realised there was already a couple in the room.\\n\\nIn full view.\\n\\nNaked.\\n\\nPounding.\\n\\nYes I went to room 34 instead of 43.\\nI couldn\\'t see the lady\\'s face because it was around the corner of a wall, but I could see the dude\\'s face, and he wasn\\'t happy.\\n\\nIt took me a few seconds to get my composure, at which point the dude - a from what I could tell a Danish guy in his late twenties - asked \"Do you mind?\" in a clearly shocked tone, still interlocked in his better half.\\n\\nI kind of fumbled a \"sorry\" in an equally shocked voice before coming up with the quickest lie I could think of.\\nI said I was asked to check this room because of a noise complaint, and apologized again. \\nIn fact, halfway through that last sentence I was already back on the hallway, making my way to room 43 with the reddest face imaginable. \\nThe couple I was relocating even asked if I was feeling ill.\\n\\nRight now I\\'m sitting at the reception praying to everything (un)holy I won\\'t run into the Danish couple before my shift ends, and that my manager never finds out...\\n\\nTldr: Had to check a room i thought was empty, but I went to the wrong room and interrupted a passionate pounding sesion. Let me start by saying the happened last night around 6:48pm and I still feel awful and have just made a $125 get a well better package purchase to be shipped here so she can sit in her cast and be entertained/feel better, even though she is super excited she can just sit around and watch TV all day.\\n\\nI take a lot of pride in being a hands-on, do activities, play around, fun dad. Well, when my 5-year-old and 2 year old wanted to go outside and jump on the trampoline after dinner I was all about it! \\n\\nI love the trampoline, we have a nice sturdy one which can hold up to about 800lbs I think, I weigh about 240lbs and I am still able to jump and flip and do whatever. Anyways, one of my daughter\\'s favorite games is to just jump in circles around the edge and chase each other. Every now and then I will stop and throw a kink in the works, or I will give her a light pop to boost her a little higher then she is used to jumping. This time I decided to pop her and she flung pretty high up, she landed fine we had a good laugh and kept jumping. We took a brief break and began jumping again, I asked her if she wanted to pop up high again she said enthusiastically \"Yes!\", so I took it upon myself to really go for the launch, you know kinda like trying to send her into orbit, she would love it! I timed the jump, I put about 85% force into it, and next thing I know the doesn\\'t pop up but instead crumples to the trampoline and immediately starts crying. This was not a cry I had heard before so I knew something was wrong, I laid down with her as she tried to catch her breath. By this point, my wife and 2 year old had come over from the playground to check on us. All my five year old kept saying was that she wanted to go inside that she broke her foot. In an odd twist I started to laugh because I had never heard her say this before and my wife just kind of looked at me like \"what is wrong with you, why are you laughing?\" I had no idea but it soon helped my 5-year-old laugh-cry which made me feel better, right up until I looked down and saw her left ankle was twice the size of her right ankle. We got her off the trampoline and onto the couch and decided that she needed to go to urgent care. I stayed home with the 2-year-old and my wife took my five-year-old.\\n\\nObviously I was worried and knew something was not right with her foot/ankle and was just trying to focus on my 2-year-old and have fun with her. Waiting on my wife\\'s call about what was wrong felt like it took forever, so when my phone finally rang I answered right away and this is where the night took a very humorous turn...\\n\\nMy wife called not with news about my 5-year-olds ankle, but instead with news that our daughter had just told the entire waiting area that her mom had Corona Virus but she is better now... WHAT!?? hahaha, my wife has never had Corona and we do not know anyone who has had it, she has allergies and we said we are glad she did not have it Corona but never that she has had it. So she must have heard us wrong, but she said the entire waiting room was like WTF!? So after a little laugh, we hung up and I went back to waiting.\\n\\nThe next call came with the news of the break and the severe sprain. When they returned home with he sky blue cast all I wanted to do was hug her and tell her how sorry I was and all she wanted to do was tell me how excited she was that the Dr. told her that she is going to have to just sit on the couch and watch TV. She also assured me it was not my fault and we were just having fun and that she cannot wait to heal so we can jump on the trampoline again soon. \\n\\nNeedless to say, after she went to be I cried for a minute then drank a handful of beers with my wife as we reflected on how amazing out daughters are and how I am no longer allowed to pop someone 1/4 my body size and weight on a trampoline. \\n\\nTL;DR - I am a fun dad but tried to launch my daughter to the moon on a trampoline and instead broke and severely sprained her ankle. She still loves me. There’s no obligatory “this didn’t happen today” because this happened a few hours ago and I’m still mortified.\\n\\nI’m on holiday with family and on a cruise, we all decided it would be a great idea to go tanning after a long walk around the city we’re docked in. We went to the tanning area on the top deck and I split from my family as there wasn’t many beds free and I saw a bed open next to this really attractive girl who looks early 20s (same as me) and I think I could have a good shot here so I occupy that bed and make a few bits of chit chat until the tiredness from the walk kicks in and I completely deck out and fall asleep right there. I must’ve moved around a lot while asleep because I woke up 15 minutes later by a family member telling me to cover myself up as one of my balls was hanging out of my shorts. \\n\\nFirst thing I did was cover up then look to the side to see the girl is no longer there but probably saw just like everyone else who walked past in the 15 minutes. I’m on this ship another week and the embarrassment will live with me forever. Help.\\n\\nTL;DR: fucked up my chances with a girl by my own nutsack that fell out while I was sleeping\\n\\nEDIT: Saw the girl in the breakfast room and after a while of thinking of what to say I went up and talked to her it went along the lines of “so I don’t know if you was there but I showed off a little more than intended yesterday” she said she left before that happened to go for dinner but would’ve found it hilarious so I guess that’s a massive win! I said I’ll catch up with her later and she sounded happy with that so I guess it wasn’t a complete embarrassment! Sorry to the many people who did walk past me though hope you enjoyed the view. Obligatory this didn’t happen today but a few years ago.\\n\\nI wanna start by saying drugs and drug use are pretty common place in the restaurant industry, mainly alcohol and cocaine are the most common. One to wind you down after work and one o get you going for a rush. Other drugs are not hard to find.\\n\\nWell I was a bit of a hippy growing up, I’m talking white boy with dreadlocks that played bass is a slightly psychedelic rock band so naturally I started a pretty good relationship with hallucinogenic drugs, mainly mushrooms and acid.\\n\\nFast forward a couple years, I’m out of culinary school in my early 20s working away for a restaurant that had one of the best kitchen crews I’ve ever had the pleasure of working with.\\n\\nI got the rare Friday off so I start making plans with my buddies to take the day for a much needed mushroom trip as I hadn’t done them in a couple years.\\n\\nAround 230 we take our dose, about 5.5 grams each and start waiting for them to kick in.\\n\\nNow for anyone who has never done them they can take anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour to kick in. So me and my buddies are just smoking weed and playing video games. About 40 minutes after taking them I got a call from work\\n\\n“So and so cut his hand pretty bad we need you in ASAP”\\n\\nSo being the good employee I am I say “yeah no problem I’ll be there in 30 minutes”\\n\\nGet off the phone and my buddy buddy asks “uhhh, dude what did you just agree too”\\n\\nWithout missing a beat “I’m going in to work, guy cut his hand”\\n\\n“Dude were are like 10 minutes out from tripping”\\n\\n“Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck”\\n\\nI panic briefly but remember past experience of friends having bad trips and calm myself down. Knowing we have a good crew I’m thinking shit maybe I can just hide down on fryers for the night or something.\\n\\nI get in, not tripping to bad yet, colours are brighter and I’ve got a warm feeling in my stomach. Okay I fucking got this. Stroll over to the reservation book. About 150 people between 6 and 8, right in the middle of when I’ll be peaking. Okay I’m fucked...\\n\\nGet onto the line and turns out I’m working sauté with a guy I’m so in sync with we barely have to talk. I ask to take the easy job of setting up pans and plating figure I’d set myself on fire if I was the one cooking\\n\\nAs we get into the bulk of the rush I start tripping harder and harder, things look like they are breathing, getting minor hallucinations in my peripheral vision but I’m keeping my shit together\\n\\nAt about 7 we are just flying, food is coming out so well and the guy calling out orders is keeping everyone motivated and says “holy shit the sauté boys are killing it tonight”\\n\\nI can’t contain myself anymore and just burst out laughing, everyone looks at me like I’m crazy. As I’m laughing I manage to say “I’m on fucking mushrooms man” which sends the whole kitchen into an uproar that can be heard from the dining room\\n\\nWord got around quick to everyone and they are all making fun of me and pointing and laughing. Word gets to the owner; he comes back takes a look at me and asks the board caller “has he been putting up food?” \\n\\n“Yeah he’s been killing it” \\n\\n“then I don’t give a fuck what he’s on, just keep killing it”\\n\\nRest of the night goes smooth so I guess it wasn’t much of a fuck up in the end but it was a hell of an interesting night for sure.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: forgot I took mushrooms, accepted a shift at work.\\n\\nEdit: thanks for silver and gold you heathens. But as many other people do I’d prefer you to give your money to local addictions services in your area\\n\\nEdit: extra story. I currently work at the same place this happened at but they sold the place last year. It’s a marina restaurant so it’s seasonal but next summer will be my 11th in a row, I’m currently the sous chef for the new owners. We are open year round but on a lot smaller of a scale cause winter is cold in Canada.\\n\\nEdit: holy shit guys I just got off my second shift of the day. This got way bigger than I expected I’ll try to reply to as many people as I can\\n\\nEdit, I’ve now been recognized from this post. Shout out AB and DS So this actually happened about 3 weeks ago. \\n\\nRewind to a night of heavy drinking, rocking out, and sleeping with a coworker. She was exceptionally fine so I decided to end the foreplay with a little tongue action. Everything feels clean, no offensive smell or taste. We move onto the main course and I notice a more than offensive smell, Must\\'ve dug up something deep. So I finish her and end the night.\\n\\nA day later and my throat is sore, but I think nothing of it as I was drinking and smoking heavily the night before. \\n\\nTwo days later, my left tonsil is black, green, and white, swollen more than 2x it\\'s size and hurts like a mf. I go down to the local med express to have it looked at and after about 35 mins I see the doctor. With a look of concern on his face, he tells me I need to go to the ER. \\'The ER?\\' I asked \\'is it really that bad?\\' The doc asks me how long it\\'s been hurting and I told him I had just noticed it today. He tells me it\\'s very Aggressive and spreading rapidly; it\\'s beyond his treatment. So I head down to the ER to get asked more questions and wait to see another doctor. He finally comes in, looks at it and tells me they\\'re going to have to drain my tonsil with a syringe (which didn\\'t feel the best, by the way).\\n\\nA script of painkillers, steroids for the swelling, amoxicillin, a few tears later and I\\'m all better.\\n\\ntl;dr eating a girl out while she has a bacterial infection might land you in the ER for tonsilitis.\\n\\nEdit: \\n\\nFun fact: the hospital bill was $606 :)\\n\\n\\nso it seems a few of you believe my teeth are rotting out of my skull and my mouth is just a festoon of bacteria. Well, [here\\'s my mouth](https://imgur.com/a/friZU)\\n\\nAs for the multiple strangers diagnosing me over a post, I appreciate your professional opinion, but I\\'d rather take my doctor\\'s first hand diagnosis. \\n\\nAnd since I finally made it to the front page, hi Mom.. Hey reddit,\\n\\nThrowaway because I really don’t want this on my main and it getting linked back to me. TL:DR at the bottom.\\n\\nObligatory the TIFU technically happened over a year ago but it hit me today at lunch.\\n\\nOkay so I’ll start off by saying my mother and father divorced 5 and a half years ago, my mom has remarried but my dad has been very hit and miss with his luck dating. When he first started dating women I’d always get introduced to them early and then they would disappear off the face of the earth so I asked my dad to not introduce me to anyone until they are serious and have been together for at least 3 or 4 months. \\n\\nA bit of back story so y’all can see where this is going. Last July to be exact me and some buddies were out at a bar and being young competitive men saw some older ladies out at the bar (mid 40’s) and had a bit of a joke around that none of us would be able to take any of them home. Well about 10 drinks and a few hours later our little laugh turned into a serious competition. We went over introduced ourselves, had small talk about what they are doing out, were a bit flirty etc and hit them up for a bit of a dance. I got talking to an absolutely fit, stunning dark haired lady who I’ll call Susan. We were flirting, having a dance and a good time, I got her some drinks and could tell she was having a great time. Anyway as the night progressed I thought I’d shoot my shot and see if I could take a milf home, I found out that she had 2 kinds, one who was only a year younger than me. Here I am, fulfilling one of my biggest fantasies. So I get a Uber for us and she comes back to my apartment. We had really good sex and I got her number the next day after I drove her back to her car. We hooked up 2 more times before I met my current girlfriend.\\n\\nWell a couple of weeks ago my dad calls me and tells me he wants me to meet this woman he has been dating for 5 months. He’d told me a bit about her, including that her name was Susan but we live in a pretty big city and I never thought anything of it. SOMEHOW OF EVERYTHING HE TOLD ME NOTHING REGISTERED IN MY BRAIN. He had said she had 2 kids a similar age to me, and most importantly that they had really hit things off and he really enjoyed her company and wasn’t feeling lonely for the first time in years. Anyway he asked me to come for lunch today to meet her and was really excited. \\n\\nI got to lunch around 15 minutes early and was waiting for my dad and the new lady he’s dating to show up, and low and behold I see my dad pull up out the front of the cafe we are having lunch at and see him and the new lady get out of the car. At this point I did the biggest double take of my life, surely it couldn’t be...\\n\\nBUT IT WAS, my dad, for 4-5 months has been dating the milf I took home from a bar over a year ago. I nearly had a panic attack. As soon as they walked in my dad pointed at the table that I was sitting at and I saw Susan’s face screw up. She was walking behind my dad and just pulled a face that said “don’t you dare say anything right now”. \\n\\nSo I sat through the most awkward 45 minute lunch of my life, sweating profusely with my dad asking me if I was alright because I looked sick. I can’t even remember what we talked about at lunch because the whole time I realised that me and my dad are tunnel buddies now and I honestly am at a loss for what will even happen next. I want to talk my dad but I can’t even imagine the conversation at this stage. I’m hoping Susan breaks things off and it doesn’t go any further. How the fuck does this even happen, it’s like the plot to a bad porn movie!!!\\n\\nTL:DR - my dad is dating a lady who I have slept with before, she is mid 40’s and my dad is early 50’s and I can tell he is head over heels for her. Just so y’all know I’m 24.\\n\\nTIFU update - so this has blown up and I decided to tell a couple of my buddies to ask what to do. I’ll be catching up with dad with some beers to tell him because if the situation was reversed I’d want to know. Will update after I’ve told him. Today was about 4 weeks ago. I work in sales and the wife and I went to a big yearly conference at a fancy hotel in a major city a few hours away. It’s always a fun conference. Lots of free food and booze, with a very nice hotel room. A 4 day all expenses paid getaway with no kids is always fun, and allows for some much needed one on one time as a couple. \\n\\nAfter our main event and dinner on Friday (and the 3 hour open bar), my wife and I and some clients went to a local pub and had a few more drinks to cap off the night. The wife and I waked back to the hotel instead of ubering (only about 6 blocks) down the walking path next to a nice waterway that flows through the area of town we were in. Beautiful night, drunk, and romantic walk back to the hotel led to some fun time in the room. \\n\\nFast forward to yesterday. We have 2 kids, boy (2) and girl (6). We love our kids and our life. About 2 months ago, we finally decided we were done having kids. We had talked about a third for over a year, but decided we had one of each, and the oldest being 6-7 years older than the youngest would be too big of a gap. So, I scheduled a vasectomy for August 1st. I went in Thursday and got the snip. Easy peasy. Now, just 3 days of relaxing with a bag of peas on my man bits. Probably binge some shows, game a bit, you know... As I’m sitting on our couch watching Lucifer, my wife walks in to the living room with 3 positive pregnancy tests... Wtf. Apparently the proper precautions weren’t taken in our night of drunken love making. \\n\\nSo... Baby #3 it is.\\n\\nTL;DR I had drunken sex with my wife and didn’t use protection or pull. On the day after my vasectomy we find out we’re pregnant.\\n\\nEdit: Thanks for the hardware kind stranger!! Gold, too! Thank you!!\\n\\nEdit 2: we are excited for our 3rd, we both have good jobs, insurance, and a good home. We have no desire to terminate our pregnancy. Yes, we had decided to stop trying for a third, but we’re ok with a happy accident. Thank you for some of your genuine concern. \\n\\nEdit 3: I think most people understood this, but still. I’m aware we have a 2 year old who is also a sibling. I don’t want to edit the post, but I was referring to the gap between our oldest and the new baby being almost 7 years.\\n\\nEdit: Guys. Thank you so much for the uplifting words and great stories of your similar situation, or large age gap between siblings. It’s been so wholesome and reassuring. Y’all the best. Although this has taken place over the last few weeks,  I just realized what happened today. \\n\\nI have a German shepherd, Kelly, who is the sweetest dog ever. She has always been very shy about eating around my other dog, so they eat separately. It started when I would sing her a little tune while filling her bowl, and then it became a little fun thing that my husband and I both did. We would sing such hits as “Kelly and the Jets” and “(You’re the) Kelly in Disguise)” where we would change several lyrics to make the song about her. \\n\\nThis morning before work, I filled her bowl like I always do, and she just sat there and stared me down. Confused, I walked away to go get ready for work. I came back and she was still staring, food bowl still full. And that’s when it hit me. So I started singing “She’s got electric toots, a brown-fur suit, you know I read it in a magazine! Ohhhhhhh! K-K-K-Kelly and the Jets!”\\n\\nAnd sure enough, the little shit started eating.\\n\\nTL;DR: My dog only eats when I sing like I’m her jester, and now I have to make up more songs to appease her.\\n\\n[Dog Tax](https://imgur.com/gallery/Zq7YBDf)\\n\\n**UPDATE:** For breakfast, I sang Kelly Chameleon as made famous by Culture Club.\\n\\nAlso, if anyone wants to help with lyrics, send them to u/PM-Me-Kelly-Lyrics! Obligatory \\'this didn\\'t happen today, but two-ish years ago\\'\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nA few years back i was working as a teamleader for a fundraising agency.  \\n\\nI was responsible for one of the street fundraising teams (you know, those annoying girls and guys in colorful t-shirts, that want your money for some charity?) and had a new guy in my team.\\n\\nWhile i was talking to someone about the charity, that we were working for i noticed some commotion going on behind me. I turned around to see the new guy in a pretty intense (verbal) fight with someone that\\'s just about to get physical. Of course i apologize, walk over to him and ask him what the fuck he thinks he is doing.\\n\\nHe then explains to me, that the other guy is a neo-nazi who apparently was harassing some students and New Guy intervened.\\n\\nFair enough - the person in question turned out to actually be a neo-nazi and the students confirmed his story, so i explain to him that while i hold him helping some students being harassed by neo-nazis in high regard, I never want to see him get in a physical fight with anyone ever again, while wearing a t-shirt with the charity\\'s logo and to rather just call the cops. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nFast forward a week or so\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nMe and my team are doing our jobs as per usual. New Guy hadn\\'t had any issues after this and was doing pretty well.\\n\\nI hear someone shouting some obscenities. Nothing out of the ordinary - people don\\'t like being bothered by us, and some react aggressively, that\\'s just part of the job. I still turn around to see whats going on, only to see New Guy take off his shirt and punch someone in the face....\\n\\nOf course i immediately run over and fire him on the spot (If you have time to take off your shirt, then its not self defense) and ask him what the fuck is going on.\\n\\nHe answers: \"But you told me not to fight when wearing the charity\\'s clothes so i took it off\" with an impressively puzzled look on his face - he really didn\\'t understand what he got fired for...  \\n\\n\\n  \\nTL:DR: Told a junior colleague not to fight people while wearing his work clothes. A week later he punches someone in the face, but takes off his t-shirt first\\n\\n\\nEdit to clarify:\\nSome of you seem to misunderstand something - he was not fired for standing his ground in the interaction with the neo-nazi. He was fired for punching someone else in the face over being insulted, a week later. I\\'ve always been interested in doing one of those at-home kits that tell you your ethnicity estimates.  My mother has, for many years, claimed that her own great-grandmother was completely Native American, and I recently learned that this is apparently something common for Southerners to claim, but that it is rarely true.  I finally went ahead and bought one of the kits because there is nothing I enjoy more in life than proving my mother wrong.  \\n\\nFast forward a few weeks.  I get my results.  I am 0% Native America, which isn\\'t exactly shocking.  The real surprise comes from the fact that I am also 0% Eastern European.\\n\\nThis probably wouldn\\'t mean much for most people, but I happen to be Polish.  Or at least, I thought I was.  I have an unpronounceable, very Polish last name.  My great-grandparents were Polish-speaking immigrants.  My paternal grandfather himself spoke Polish as a child.\\n\\nMy first thought was that the test was a mistake.  My results came over a week before the projected arrival date, and I KNEW I should be somewhere around 25% Polish/Eastern European.  So maybe there had been an error somewhere at the lab.  I started digging around through my DNA relative matches.  I had matched with an extended cousin with my mom\\'s maiden name, living in the state that she grew up in.  So the DNA analyzed was definitely mine, and this was not a switched-tube situation.\\n\\nThere were only two possible explanations:  either my own dad was not my biological father, or my Polish grandfather was not the biological father of my dad.  \\n\\nI look a lot like my father, so it seemed unlikely that we were not related.  However, there was no strong family resemblance between my dad and his own father.  In fact, my grandfather and many of his siblings had a (we\\'ll call it) striking nose that my sister and I had often rejoiced in not inheriting.  Also, my paternal grandparents had a disastrous marriage and bitter divorce—an affair did not seem out of the question.\\n\\nMy paternal grandfather died over ten years ago, but my paternal grandmother is still living and I gave her a call.  It took a while for me to fully explain the DNA testing to her—she\\'s 87, but we got there.  She denied it and tried to explain the unexpected results with a long ramble about migrating European tribes before I was finally able to make her understand that I would be able to test relatives from the Polish side of the family and determine whether or not I was actually related to them.  She told me that she didn\\'t think that was a good idea, and I should think about it before contacting anyone.\\n\\nI think I knew right then, but it was not until today, two days later, that she finally admitted it to my sister:  my father had been lied to his entire life about his biological father.  \\n\\nSo who is my actual paternal grandfather?  TBD.  My grandmother promised my sister that she will tell the two of everything when my sister gets into town for Christmas.  She requested that we not tell anyone until then (it\\'s too late, my sister already told everyone).  \\n\\nTL;DR:  Did an ethnicity test, found out my father was apparently the product of an extra-marital affair and never knew.  \\n\\nEdit to add: I\\'ve had a recent string of people asking me for an update.  I posted one a while back, here is the link: https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/7kat5w/tifupdate_and_the_grandfather_is/   This morning, I woke up on the wrong side of the bed, mainly due to lack of sleep. I decided to go to Starbucks for some caffeine to help offset the long day ahead of me, as you do. At a traffic light really close to the drive-thru, I was right behind a large SUV sitting in the rightmost lane. I wanted to turn right, and they did not—I couldn\\'t turn, but no biggie. After a long wait, light turns green, and they decide to turn right spontaneously. I was annoyed, but whatever. (No signs say you can\\'t turn right on red.)\\n\\nThey turn into the Starbucks drive-thru, blocking me from going and making it so that I\\'d have to partially block the small road leading into the strip mall or circle around. I had to be somewhere soon, so I took my chances. They didn\\'t pull in all the way, so I stuck out in the small street, annoyed. Luckily no one came behind me.\\n\\nI guess I was in an extra bitchy mood today, but I just started hating this lady and her stupid massive SUV and the little chihuahua hanging out her car window and the stupid TV\\'s playing cartoons in the car and the 6 frappucinos they had to hand her. I thought, \"I bet she\\'s one of those super shallow people who lives for the rat race.\" I pulled up to the window to get my drink, wanting this clearly shallow-ass lady to leave already.\\n\\nOnce I pulled up, they smiled, handed me my drink and said, \"The person in front of you paid for your order already.\"\\n\\nI had never felt so forcefully slapped by the universe before. I could practically hear the words \"shut the fuck up\" ringing in my dumb little brain. Immediately my day got 100 times better and easier.\\n\\nFaith in humanity restored, and I hope whoever I was so horrifically judging had a wonderful rest of their day.\\n\\nTL;DR I spent 10 minutes hating and judging the person in front of me, only to find out that they paid for my drink. Made my day, and also changed my life lol\\n\\nEdit: I posted on this sub bc I felt like a total asshole and like I fucked up being a decent person, I also fucked the \\'pay it forward\\' up so yknow\\n\\nEdit #2: apparently people have posted very similar stories (to the point where ppl think I\\'d just copy it? it\\'s not that good of a story lol) those are coincidental and this did actually happen to me this morning but if you think I\\'m boring and unoriginal don\\'t upvote, just know you\\'re not actually a detective calling me out on my bullshit\\n\\nEdit #3: sorry for so many edits...consequences to the fuck up were feeling like a complete ass So this didn’t happen yesterday, but over a year ago..\\n\\n\\nAfter a long day my wife kept saying “What?” in a response to some of the things I was saying to her (She wasn’t paying attention). So I jokingly said the following from another room...\\n\\nMe: “Sexy say what?”\\n\\nHer: “What? Oh, ha ha very funny...”\\n\\nMe: “I knew you would fall for that, at least I didn’t trick you by saying ‘updog’ like I saw on a Reddit Tinder post”\\n\\n<Long pause>\\n\\n<I look into her room and realize she is now crying and is upset about something>\\n\\nMe: “Why are you upset?”\\n\\nHer: “Are you cheating on me!? Why would you be on a Tinder site?”\\n\\nMe: “I wasn’t on a Tinder site, sometimes content comes up on the front page of Reddit based on something stupid or silly, and there was one about someone trying to flirt using ‘updog’ as a pickup line”\\n\\n<she clears her tears and looks at me>\\n\\nHer: “What is updog?”\\n\\nMe: “Not much, what is up with you?”\\n\\n\\nTL:DR: Tried to flirt with my wife, made her sad (thinking I was on tinder) then angry when I tricked her into asking me a pickup line question. This happened almost 4 years ago, but today it made me think about it.\\n\\nBackstory, I met this amazing girl at a party that some friends of mine were throwing.  It was a themed party, prep boy and school girls, and she was as kind as she was sexy.  We exchange numbers and proceed to texting and talking on the phone and went out on a few dates.\\n\\nWell, just like most relationships, I assume, she sent me a few sexy pictures of herself.  Well one day, my buddy asks me about the girl I am dating.  I tell him about her and he asks about her body.  I show him a picture she took of herself laying out by the pool, neck down.  He grabs my phone and starts swiping.  Before I can stop him he freaks out yelling “that is my fucking sister!!!” I then realize the picture he was looking at was one I took of her fully nude.  After that, he was not too happy about it, or me dating his sister.\\n\\nBut this story has a happy ending.  The reason I am posting this today, is because this is the one year anniversary of the day I married that wonderful woman, and that buddy was one of my groomsman.\\n\\nAnd before anyone asks, no, she has no clue her brother saw a picture of her nude, I think she would be mortified if she did.\\n\\nTl;dr: Was dating a girl who turned out to be my buddy’s sister, showed him a nude photo of her and he freaked out.\\n\\nEdit: since people are freaking out thinking I showed a nude picture on purpose let me clarify.  I showed my friend a picture of her in a bikini neck down that she took laying out by a pool.  She posted said picture on Instagram as well as sent it to me.  I did not willingly violate her trust by showing him a nude picture of her.  Apologies if my wording was off.\\n\\nEdit 2: Thank you for the gold and silver, you guys are awesome!  Also, since everyone asks how I didn’t know she was my buddy’s sister.  She and him have a common last name like Smith.  And I did not know his sisters name.  When I told him I was dating a girl named “Jill” (not her name) he didn’t immediately think “oh hey is that my sister.” Because it is a common name.  And as for my wife, we had been dating for a little over a month.  When she said she had a brother, I didn’t go “oh what’s his name, where does he work, what’s his astrological sign.”  Because I wanted to know her first, know her likes and hobbies.  I guess I could have dove more into questions about her family, but we weren’t at the point of meeting each other’s parents yet.  Hope this helps with those questions, if it does not. Sorry.  Again thank you for all the kind words and happy anniversary comments.  You people are amazing! Well my fuckup began when I bought a career mechanics toolboxes and everything in them. I did this because I needed one of the bigger toolboxes for work and I would sell the smaller toolbox and most of the tools I didn\\'t need or want and essentially get a 3k toolbox for free. Now this is something I was excited about because I got in essence 50-60k USD worth of Snap-on tools and toolboxes for 6k USD. \\n\\nWell I kept the larger toolbox and I put the smaller one up for sale at a price of just over a grand with my signature line\\n\\n>  \"SCAMMERS WILL RECEIVE A DICK PIC AND NOT A NICE ONE\". \\n\\nI started this when I sold a motorcycle and I was getting scammers out the ass. So I did what any rational person would do. I googled micro-penis and started sending pictures of mean ol peeny-weenies to the scammers. The scammers stopped bothering me. I sold my bike, so I thought \"truck yeah! I\\'m going to do this every time I sell something!\"\\n\\nWell fast forward a week or two, I match with a cute girl on bumble. We\\'re both mechanics so we have similar personalities. We agree on a time and a place and off we go.\\n\\nThat night I got to the restaurant before her. I went to shed a tear for nelson and when I came back. I rounded a corner and came mask to mask with her. But something I never expected. She was WAY WAY cuter than her profile pictures. She didn\\'t smell like oil and her hands were soft! She smile/laughed and clumsily said Hi while fogging up her glasses and I could\\'ve been Liam Neeson\\'s daughter because I was taken. I\\'m like 93% sure the feeling was mutual.\\n\\nIt was one of those moments where you just know. \\n> Yeah, I like this one. \\n\\n\\nSince no diner is serving inside because covid. We decide to sit outside in 20° F weather. \\n\\nWe ate in the cold and everything was going great. Even though it was freezing and cold, cold and freezing and for some reason the waiter put ice in my water even though it was you guessed it. Freezing and cold. I asked her after if she wanted to get ice cream. Because even though it was cold enough for a fart to come out solid I wanted to spend some more time with her and y\\'know, ice cream!\\n\\nWe went got some in my car and I drove her back and we started talking about work and toolboxes. Well I obviously wanted to show her the booty I scored, specifically the toolbox I was selling since she would understand why I was so hyped about all of it. So I whip out my lil ol mobile phone. I downloaded the pics of the booty I scored straight from the seller\\'s ad so they were in my download folder. \\n\\nAnd I just so happened to forget I downloaded a new set of micro-dick pictures immediately after........\\n\\nHere is a link to one of the pictures if you dare. We both know you\\'re not strong enough to not look.\\n\\n https://images.app.goo.gl/paujMs26dc37gV3d8\\n\\nAnyway in my moment of embarrassment I swiped once more to attempt to make the fat bald man in a inner tube go away and showed her what looks like a uncooked mini sausage sitting on top of two oranges. \\n\\nI immediately pulled up my ad showed her my signature line and explained that I send them to scammers and she laughed and I think in my embarrassment managed to blurt out \"don\\'t worry mines normal.\" But it was kind of hard to talk around the foot that was in my mouth. My only saving grace was that both of those pictures are wildly different. Anyway she stayed for another half hour before heading out.\\n\\nI think what hurt the most happened right after she left. I high tailed it to my best friend of 11 years and told him what happened and how I\\'ll probably never hear from this great girl again because she thinks I have a lincoln log for a pecker and he said.\\n\\n> I can\\'t believe you did tha......y\\'know what I can see you doing that.\\n\\nSo not only did I show a girl I really liked a dick pic on the first date. I showed her two. That weren\\'t mine. And were very very very much not normal. There\\'s literally no worse version of what happened.\\n\\n\\nAnyway we\\'re going out again this week. I can\\'t wait \\n\\nEdit: seeing a lot of comments calling me insensitive. To all of you who think I am. Your mom wear combat boots. \\n\\nEdit for those who care: the dates are going really well. \\n\\nTl;dr I showed a girl I was on a first date with a couple of micro peeny-weenies. This happened today in New Zealand.  I walked home after 1 am, drunk from a night out (an unsafe FU in itself) and upon arrival realised I had no house key.  Not wanting to bother my flatmates by waking them up (in a classic too-nice-kiwi move of feeling apologetic simply for existing) my lizard brain decided to wait out the night in our backyard instead (a major FU, it’s winter in New Zealand).  We have a creepy empty dusty shed that we never go inside so I thought this sensible.  After 10 mins my phone died (so no light).  After 2 hours I realised I might die of hypothermia so decided I should go back to the front of the house and bang down the door to wake the flatties.  That’s when I realised I also padlocked myself into the backyard and couldn’t see the lock code dial to free myself again (major FU - now no choice but to wait it out til daylight). I Bear Gryllsed up and found a hose for water and a bag of soil for a pillow.  After many (many) hours of shifting from sitting in a plastic outdoor chair,  to sprawling up a set of tiny concrete steps, to lying on a patch of (wet) fake grass/turf, to huddling next to a brick wall for shelter, to lying in the foetal position on broken wooden slats - all while it rained and flooded, and all in and out of (slight) consciousness - after 7 am, it finally became light enough to see the padlock code, let myself out of the yard and bang down the front door to be rescued.\\n\\nMy lowest point was when I found a spade, dug a hole, and shat in my own backyard.  At least my apologetic drunk brain shat away from the crops and politely returned the spade afterwards.\\n\\nMy flatmates are horrified that I didn’t just wake them in the first place, they would never have minded if I did.\\n\\nI might be lucky to be alive and well (albeit a fuckwit).\\n\\nWorst of all, this afternoon we found my key on the ground right outside the front door, under a container of melted ice cream (that I brought back from town, fuck knows why).  Turns out I had it all along!\\n\\nTL;DR drunk me locked myself outside overnight in the harsh NZ winter and shat in my own backyard... but turns out had my house key all along. Woke up to him whimpering/ crying in his sleep. It was still dark out and I was so groggy that I lazily slung my hand over his face and tried shaking him awake while sleepily saying “Babe, wake up.” I couldn’t  see so I just start feeling for his face to gently slap him awake. \\n\\nIn his nightmare haze, he screams and bites my hand. In my sleep haze, I was totally not expecting that shit and my brain immediately deduces my husband’s been possessed so I start screaming. This caused him to start screaming more as he woke up. Lesson learned. Sleepy time means every man for himself apparently.\\n\\nHe later told me his nightmare and it was truly fucked. He was dreaming he was having sex with me but then noticed it wasn’t me, but some kind of creature. \\n\\nTL;DR: possible succubus scenario. Saved my husband’s soul but got bit in the process. We’re okay now.\\n\\nPS: Thanks for the all the awards! Wasn’t sure if ppl wanted their usernames all up on this (I’m new to fame, sorry) but I did my best to send pms to everyone who contributed! Hope this post put a smile on your face, whoever you are! Im happy this little diddy about me & Hubby’s misadventures in co-habitation was so relatable! Happened yesterday, my face is still red. For context, I am a female.\\n\\nI was getting my mouth cleaned, and my super amazing dental hygienist was talking about some gingivitis in one area of my mouth. She pulls her tools out, and my dumb ass looks up at her and says, \"I wish mouths were like vaginas, you know, self cleaning.\"\\n\\nWe both stop and stare at each other. Her, because she cannot process what the fuck I have just said, and I, because I cannot believe what the fuck I have just said. \\n\\nA few centuries later, she busts out laughing. I turn twelve shades of red and wish desperately I could melt into the chair and disappear forever. \\n\\nShe took it in stride, though. \"Haha, I\\'m glad they\\'re not, I\\'d be out of a job!\" \"Never heard that one before!\" \\n\\nI am just thankful I said it when she was almost done.\\n\\nTL;DR: Compared my mouth to a vagina to dental hygienist, as in self cleaning. She was amused.\\n\\nEdit: I\\'d like to say thank you to you all, and I\\'m so glad you enjoy my awkwardness. My life gets so entertaining when I am forced to interact with other people in real life. Also, I\\'m genuinely happy I got the chance to educate a few of you on vaginas!\\n\\nEdit 2: Please see [here](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/sexual-health/keeping-your-vagina-clean-and-healthy/) for more information on how/why vaginas self clean. Also, the *vagina*, not the outty bits. Aka dick hole/baby cannon. We wash the outty bits This literally happened 15 minutes ago. For a bit of backstory, my GF has lost her card so has been using the second one I have linked to my bank account until her new one arrives and sending me the money for what she buys.\\n \\nSo GF has been having some issues with a bad smell in her car and decided to buy one of those odour eliminator bombs to see if it would help. Only about £12 pound so seemed like a cheap solution to the problem. She sent me the money and  all seemed well.\\n\\nHowever, I\\'ve just been contacted by my bank asking me why I\\'ve been sent a payment referenced \"CAR BOMB\". They are withholding the money until they are satisfied with my answer. Slightly scared but been given golden ammunition to roast GF for the foreseeable. Hopefully everything will be okay and I\\'ll get the cash eventually.\\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\nGF pays me back for air freshener with a payment referenece CAR BOMB and now my bank is questioning me\\n\\nUPDATE\\nAfter much back and forward with a lovely lass called Meenakshi, I can confirm I finally recieved the coveted £12 and all is right with the world. I work at a mid size company with around 30 employees, all the employees start at 7 AM with the exception of the Owner/boss and myself who prefer to start at 6. I have a project coming to a close and promised to have it ready for next Monday. I thought it was a good idea to come in a few hours early so 3:30 to get a head start and impress the boss. I show up right at 3:30. I unlocked the door and went to punch in my alarm code..... I completely forgot my code, I\\'ve entered it thousands of times and I just forgot. The alarm started going off and simultaneously the phone rang it was the alarm company calling for my code and I couldn\\'t provide it. They ended up calling the owners home phone and he rushed over to turn off the alarm then of course got in an accident with an un-insured driver, had to pay everything out of pocket..... I also missed the deadline.\\n\\nTldr; went in early to impress the boss, set off the alarm, he came in to turn it off and got in an accident on the way, wasn\\'t impressed.\\n\\nEdit 1: I say \"Mid-size\" as it\\'s Mid-size for our industry\\n\\nEdit 2: I don\\'t know all the ins and outs about my bosses insurance and his accident. Didn\\'t really feel like pressing him for details, my impression is the damage was less than his deductible. As with most TIFU, this did not happen today but the memory was spurred by a post I saw on the front page. During the 2008 election, Obama came to my University to give a speech. I went through all the usual security screenings and made my way to my seat. I was about 3 rows from the front but on the outside seat of a row right against the entry and exit way for the future president. \\n\\nWhen Obama came out, he went straight to the podium to give his speech and do a QandA session. When he finished he made his way down the steps where the crowd rushed to shake his hand. I was probably 4^th or 5^th down the walkway to shake his hand. Everybody in front of me was not only shaking his hand but handing him copies of his book to sign. He had a pen in his hand and was signing away. I thought to myself \"Damn, I don\\'t have anything for him to sign. hmmm OH WAIT! Yes I do. My ticket I used to get into the event.\" There was only 1 issue with the ticket, it was in my jacket pocket...**my INSIDE jacket pocket**. So as the future president is 4 people away, I hastily reach my hand into my jacket pocket to grab my ticket but my hand kinda fumbled around a little before latching onto the ticket. Just long enough for the 2 secret service agents standing right in from of me to notice...\\n\\nThey immediately grabbed both my arms, while the one who grabbed my arm that was in the jacket twisted it to pull my hand out of the pocket while preparing to break my arm off if it was any kind of dangerous object. It all happened so fast I couldn\\'t even utter a word, but when they saw all I had was a piece of paper for Obama to sign, he let go of my arm, patted me on the shoulder, and mumbled something into his headset. I was just able to get my bearings about me and I was the last person to shake Obama\\'s hand at that event.  About that time the security all turned to Obama and shuffled him through an open door to the hallway to exit. As Obama was being ushered out he said \"Sorry guys, they said I have to leave now.\" as he was pointing at the secret service around him. So not only did I almost get taken out by secret service, I ruined anybodies day that wanted a chance to meet the man.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: Tried to shake Obama\\'s hand and get an autograph, reached in my jacket and got assaulted by secret service and made Obama have to leave which ruined a bunch of peoples day. \\n\\n What can I say? I like looking at men. And sometimes when I\\'m just hanging out in the morning that means I\\'m scrolling through my favorite NSFW subs to see the new goings on.\\n\\nI\\'ve been on Reddit for almost a year and never slipped up. Until today, that is.\\n\\nSo the kids were playing beautifully together and started playing school, of all things!!! There was no wrestling. There was no whining. There was no arguing. It was magical.\\n\\nI was lost in my little world on Reddit and my five year old daughter sneaks up behind me to give me a hug as she goes off to \"school\".\\n\\nWelp. I forgot what I had open on my phone and she says, \"Wow, he\\'s strong!\" Me: \"??\" Her: \"Aaaaaaand he has a big penis. Okay bye!\"\\n\\nFuck.\\n\\nLuckily we are a fairly body positive family so there wasn\\'t much explaining to do there and I quickly found a picture of a waterfall and explained that other one was just a picture I accidentally opened. I really hope that memory wasn\\'t seared into her brain and she never talks about this experience again. Maybe?\\n\\nTLDR: My five year old daughter accidentally saw her first dick pic courtesy of me being on Reddit while I drank my coffee.\\n\\nETA: [THIS IS WHY MY FIVE YEAR OLD KNOWS THE CORRECT TERMS FOR BODY PARTS](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kids-real-words-private-parts_n_5bf2e62ce4b0757388210397) Obligatory this happened in the past 30 months or so. Today (Saturday, actually, I found out. Also, sorry if I don\\'t have the best English).\\n\\nTL;DR: 28yo male here from Europe. My closest friends from my childhood and early school up to high school are still there, even if they are not many. However, in the past four years, I developed a friendship with a guy and I consider him my best friend now. On Saturday I found out that I was casually fucking his mother. To make things worse, we call each other \\'bro\\'.\\n\\nLonger version.\\n\\nThe grandparents that raised me (from my mother side) moved a few years ago in a small town and left me the apartment in the big city (the capital of the country). I visited them as often as I could and I still do. About three years ago, I went out on a summer Friday night to one of the few bars in there. I took my beer and went out on the terrace because I am a smoker. All the tables were occupied, but this one had a lady staying alone at a table with four seats (actually there were two tables put together). I asked her if I can detach one and make it two tables for two. She said I don\\'t have to, I can just sit, she\\'s finishing her glass of wine and she\\'s leaving. Meh. I stayed. A bit later that night we had sex at her place. We exchanged phone numbers and that was it, I didn\\'t stay there through the night.\\n\\nThe following day I texted her because I liked it a lot. I mean, she was kinky as fuck for a first one and I wanted to go for the second. After that kind of \\'interaction\\', you either don\\'t want to see the person again or it\\'s more available.\\n\\nAnd I\\'ve got the upgrade. I will not go into that many details, but that lady is the dirtiest (in a good way) woman I\\'ve ever met. She\\'s up for anything. So we kept going every time I went to visit my grandparents. \\n\\nWhile all the above was happening, in my town I changed jobs. In there I met a guy that got hired a few weeks after me. At some random \\'office night out\\' he sat next to me and we\\'ve talked a lot because the music was too loud to hear with other people. He was a gamer, like me. We were playing the same games, we have similar hobbies and so forth. We\\'ve played together over 1000 hours in CSGO matchmaking and we\\'ve talked a lot. I found out quite quickly that his father left him and his mom when he was 5yo, that he went for school in the US and that his mother lives in the same small town as my grandparents. \"let\\'s go together once\", I\\'ve said. He goes to his mom around twice a year, because he is a complicated long-distance relationship. I go to my grandparents more often. Like 6-8 weekends/year. \\n\\nAnyway, things moved on, we even did two vacations together with our dates. But this fucking week I told him I am visiting my grand\\'s in the weekend for hollydays because I will be unable to do it later in December. And he said he will join me, because of the same reasons. So he drove me on Friday evening and left me at my grandparents home. \"Let\\'s meet tomorrow, at my place\", he said.\\n\\nTwo hours after my arrival, I messaged the lady and told her \\'i\\'m in town\\'. She replied and told me her son is visiting and she can\\'t meet. In that moment I got a weird feeling through my body. It felt like a cold heat. I can\\'t explain it. I was 90% convinced that Lucas is the son of Valerie (names are made up). \\n\\nThe next day, before 11:00 AM, he texted me that we are set for a BBQ. I asked for the address and he said that he will pick me up, we buy some meat and we go. I really wanted to know the address but I didn\\'t insist on the matter. So yea, we\\'re going there, I know the road, I know where he\\'s taking me. Fuck. My. Life. He opens the door, his mother is there and he literally says: \"Hey mom, this is my Bro\". I felt like I need to throw up. He said the names, I shake her hand and I say: Nice to meet you. \\n\\nThe lady winked at me and she said: \"I think we\\'ve met before\". I was sweating bullets at this point. I shoke my head, looked at Lucas (he was smiling), and I said: \"Sorry, I can\\'t remember, but it\\'s possible\". So we had BBQ lunch but what I want to add is that during the lunch she left the table (going to the toilet, I guess) and she texted me: \"he is leaving on Sunday morning. stay till Monday\". The booner felt so awkward.\\n\\nI think I will make up a reason not to come back with Lucas and I will stay at least one more day. \\n\\nAlso, needs mentioning: the woman is damn hot. he\\'s kinky as fuck and she\\'s 90% match on my kinks. She even purchased a sex swing for better fun. I am unable to have a relationship more than two nights because the girls are too vanilla. \\n\\nGodamn I am so sorry! :(\\n\\nAnd I don\\'t even know if I should tell him or not. Also, he\\'s daily on reddit, but, from what I know, he\\'s on some r/ gaming subs. So this happened a few weeks ago, but I\\'m still not over it so thought I would share.\\n\\nA few weeks ago, my stepdad walked in from work with an \\'unlocked\\' amazon fire stick, thinking he\\'d hit the jackpot. My mom and stepdad are both big into films and series so though this could end all their subscriptions with Netflix ect.\\n\\nAs most parents, mine are fairly clueless when it comes to technology, so whenever they buy something new like this they call on me, the 27yo son to come help them out. I happily agreed, but warned them that not only was this device against the law, but also pretty terrible. I was adiment I\\'d prove this to them so they didn\\'t get lumbered with either a fine or shitty quality movies and series!\\n\\nSo I get to their house, plug it in and take a seat between the two of them on the sofa. This isn\\'t a missive sofa, so we\\'re pretty close to one another. My mom is also partially deaf, so where as most households would have their volume set to let\\'s say 20, in this house, it\\'s usually at around 50. Most of the time I\\'m there I can\\'t hear myself think if the tvs on, that\\'s how loud it usually is! Remember this for when shit hits the fan.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve ever set one of these up before, you\\'ll know they\\'re pretty much plug and go, so I had it set up in under 5 mins. I was asked to show them how to navigate to different parts with films, series ect. Thankfully, everything we tried to watch either didn\\'t work, or was just unwatchable so they were happy to just get rid. That was until my mom say the live TV option, and asked if she could see the quality of that. Sure, why not. Again it will be terrible and they\\'ll thankfully be disappointed.\\n\\nI just put channel one on and straight away, free view was better, so that was that in the bin it\\'s going. \\n\\nI went to hit back to exit out so I could turn it off and get rid. I pressed the wrong button. I pressed channel down. Oh god.\\n\\nAs soon as I clicked this button, it went to the very last channel. A live stream of porn hub. Now is the time to remember how close we\\'re sat and how loud this TV currently is. On the screen, out of nowhere was a guy sat on the sofa, girl in reverse cowgirl, legs spread and getting her backdoors well and truley smashed in by some very well gifted guy. Not only that, with the position she was in, she had basically turned into a human waterfountain that was landing just in front of the camera. The squelching, slapping and moaning noises will forever haunt me. \\n\\nI didn\\'t know what to do. My mom was screaming, the girl on the TV was screaming, I looked at my stepdad and his jaw was on the floor. I frantically start hitting any button I can to try and get me out of this nightmare, but for a good few seconds, nothing happened.\\n\\nIt finally turns off and my mom and stepdad look at each other and just burst out laughing. I\\'m sat here, in the middle of them both feeling younger and more embarrassed than I ever have in my life. Still now, I can\\'t go to the house without them bringing it up as a massive joke, when I\\'m truly still haunted by the whole thing.\\n\\nTL;DR my stepdad bought a firestick, i set it up for them, I pressed the wrong button and I ended up watching a live pornhub stream on full blast whilst sat between them. I couldn\\'t get it to turn off at first and hated my life when I finally could.\\n\\nEdit: Wow, went to sleep and work and this did well! Thanks for all the awards! \\n\\nFor all those saying that the firestick is just as good as anything else and I must be stupid the way I set it up:\\n\\n1. The firestick is good out the box with all the developed apps you can get. This however had been opened, and had third party software installed so you could watch literally and channel, film, series for free. For example, here in the uk the sky sports package is pretty expensive, but it\\'s all on there with no monthly subscriptions. The quality however isn\\'t great unless there\\'s a really good stream, which isn\\'t likely. It also had brand new films that are not yet released to netflix or anything. Again, youd find the odd gem, but it\\'s unlikely and frankly, not worth the time. \\n\\n2. I didn\\'t install these third party apps. My stepdad had it off a guy in work who had pre loaded it for him. I have had one of these before a few years back which I did myself by installing kodi and then further apps for that (I want to say genasis?). It worked a treat for me for a few months before it just became a pain in the ass. I used mine purely for live NHL as we dont get that much here in the UK. \\n\\n3. I DIDN\\'T ISTALL THESE APPS. Therefore I did not put the porn on there. I knew it was on there from experience, and I knew to avoid it. I didn\\'t however realise it was on the live tv option and the last channel for that matter. \\n\\nI\\'m glad lots of you were able to enjoy this story. The other night, I was out getting a drink with some friends from university, and for some reason or another, the conversation turned to swans.\\n\\nNow, as a kid, I remember reading the Ugly Duckling - and for some reason, I completely misunderstood it. Not the lesson of the story or anything, but the reason that the duckling was ugly in the first place. The reason being that it was, of course, a swan.\\n\\nBut for some reason, I got a few wires crossed, and thought it was in fact a duckling like the rest. Instead of thinking that the swan was a different kind of bird, I thought that swans were just male ducks. For some reason I never stopped thinking it, even though I’ve seen plenty of ducks, and literally had the differences between male and female ones pointed out to me before. I don’t know why it never got through to me. I guess I just thought they were different kinds of duck or something.\\n\\nWhat this means is that when one of my friends mentioned something about female swans, I scoffed and very loudly proclaimed that “you can’t have female swans”. I stuck by this, convinced they were fucking with me, until they realised I wasn’t kidding.\\n\\nAnd that’s how I, at the age of 19, finally learned that female swans exist. My friends won’t stop laughing at me over it, and I really have no defence other than it made sense at the time.\\n\\nTL;DR I didn’t think swans could be female, my friends won’t let me live it down. Before you go all pork on me, I\\'ll give you some insight. In Islam you discard anything with God\\'s name on it by burning it. Yesterday in Statistics, our teacher found a Bible that was left in our class. No one knew who it belonged to and our teacher said, \"You can\\'t throw it in the trash right?, there\\'s a thing against that.?\" and I, THE ONLY HIJABI IN MY GRADE said \"I think you\\'re supposed to burn it\" The whole class turned and looked at me like I wanted to kill them. I just checked and one of the proper methods of disposing a bible is by cremating it so I was right. I posted it in r/izlam, and someone commented \"Yeah, in germany we have bad memories about burning books, but we were mostly nazis back then burning anything that is against fascist doctrine\" maybe the reactions were because I live in a primarily jewish town, or because christians are unaware of how holy scriptures are to be recycled.\\nTL;DR: My teacher asked how you dispose of a Bible and I said to burn it because that\\'s the proper method but looked SAVAGE\\n\\nUPDATE: https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/ah0bxl/tifu_update_on_burning_the_bible_post/  Sorry in advance for mobile formatting.\\n\\nSo this happened yesterday night, here is some context.\\n\\nI am a serial sprainer, in the 4 years my boyfriend has lived with me, I have sprained my ankle 7 times. I have tripped random stupid crap, dog toys, a rock in the grass, stairs, anything my ankles can find they will try to kill me on.\\n\\nMy boyfriend is always there, coddling me and nurturing my softball heels. I always thought one day I will be there to nurture his aches when he would fall.. but he never fell.\\n\\nIn the four years we have lived together he has never once slipped on ice, tripped on a rock, tumbled over an ottoman, or even dragged his foot across some slippery water.\\n\\nThat was until yesterday.\\n\\nWe were Uber Eats delivering in the lazy snowfall we had in Kansas, thinking we might get some decent tips. We delivered to this townhome complex, he got out to deliver while I stayed in. On his way back to the car his phone chimed for another delivery. He pulled out his phone, and instead of paying attention down he went on a patch of ice.\\n\\nHe didn\\'t fall and crack, he fell down with enough grace to land on his butt and his elbow. Still, beggars can\\'t be choosers. \\n\\nIt was my turn.\\n\\nI was going to coddle him now. I was going to nurture his swollen softball bumps. I was going to pick him up and help him to the car and baby him while he sniffled and reeled.\\n\\nI was going to be the hero for once.. keyword being \"was.\"\\n\\nI lept out of the car. \"I can be your hero baby\" played in my head like elevator music. I felt my cape flowing figuratively behind my back.\\n\\nSuddenly I was on the ground, my knee twisted at an 80 degree angle. My hip felt the twist and it hurt so bad, I thought I broke it. Unlike him, I did not fall gracefully. I hit the ground with such a thud that the lady in the car next to us got out ready to help me.\\n\\nI laid there on the ground, air knocked out of me. Enrique Iglesias\\' \"Hero\" stopped abruptly and instead sirens were blaring in my head. I instinctively wriggled my feet to see which one was going to get too thicc for socks.\\n\\nEverything seemed fine until I went to get up. Nope. My knee was kaput, and I let out a gasp in surprise.\\n\\nOf course my boyfriend was up, not even bruised or limping, ready to swipe me up and buckle me into the car.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and this sweet lady was trying to help me up, but I elected to chubby lady crawl by the car so I could get up myself. I had them open the door and I crawled in, thanking the lady and buckling myself in.\\n\\nAs I sniffled and licked my wounds, he told me he was grateful that my first reaction was to try to help him. We laughed and joked about how funny it was. It was like a cartoon skit, I was Peter Griffin falling down and holding my knee, hissing between my teeth. One moment I was coming around the car the next I was on the ground with a shocked look on my face. I am still giggling about it.\\n\\nHe went to the store to get us some treats since we didn\\'t want to end the night on a bad note, and once he disappeared into the store I just bawled and screamed. I think if anyone heard me they would think I was possessed.\\n\\nI just wanted to be there for him for once, I felt so useless that even when he fell I couldn\\'t help him. Instead once again I was the victim of a sprain, only I wish it was my ankle. This time it is my knee, and I would rather sprain my ankle twice again. \\n\\nI composed myself by the time he got back to the car with skittles.\\n\\nToday I am confined to the bed, wishing we had our uber card already so we could get some crutches and gooey pizza. Now I am browsing reddit until my phone dies then napping while it charges.\\n\\nHe on the other hand, doesn\\'t even have a bruise to show for it.\\n\\nBoyfriend: 8\\nMe: 0\\n\\nTL;DR: I fall down a lot, my boyfriend never falls. He finally fell for the first time in 4 years, and when I went to help him. I fell down too and ended up spraining my knee.\\n\\nSuper Edit: Thanked people for gold and platinum, was unintentional super cringe, so.. yeah. Glad ya\\'ll got a laugh tho. This happened a few years ago. \\n\\nI used to work in the kitchen in one of Heathrow\\'s private airline lounges, where the rich and famous were everyday customers. I did basic food prep and helped the chefs wherever possible.\\n\\nOn this particular day, I came into work feeling fine except for some minor stomach pains. One of the chefs asked me to go to the storeroom to get some oil for the fryer. When I got there my stomach pains intensified, and I could feel the gassy pressure in my bowels that could only be flatulence. The storeroom is rarely used, and there was no-one around, so I let rip. A large, silent fart. And then it hit me. The foulest, eggiest smell I am ever likely to produce. It filled the room and took my breath away. I covered my mouth, grabbed the oil, and got out of there quickly, closing the door behind me to stop the smell flowing into the kitchen. I handed the chef his oil. \\n\\nA few minutes later one of the other chefs came running into the kitchen, saying something about a gas leak. A group of us followed him down the corridor, straight to the storeroom. Fuck. The storeroom stores lots of dry goods like oils, cans, bottles, and anything that doesn\\'t need to be refrigerated. It also houses the back end of our drinks machine (which feeds through to the main lounge and lets customers pour their own drinks) which uses compressed gas canisters, of which we had about 5 that we store next to the machine. The chefs all piled into the room, noses held high, and start sniffing.\\n\\n\"That definitely smells like gas!\"\\n\\n\"Are the canisters leaking?\"\\n\\nSo there I am, standing in the dry storeroom, watching about 4 chefs in front of me inhaling my fart and trying to find the source. Do I admit it was me?\\n\\nThe Head Chef suddenly appears. He takes a deep breath. \\n\\n\"That\\'s gas, for sure. We need to turn off the kitchen to make sure we don\\'t ignite it, and evacuate the customers. Who do we call, the fire brigade? Airport maintenance?\"\\n\\nFuck fuck fuck. \\n\\n\"Uh, guys... it was me\". \\n\\nThey turn to look at me.\\n\\n\"I came in here earlier... and I farted\". \\n\\nThere\\'s a look of relief on their faces - so it\\'s not a gas leak! We\\'re all safe! \\n\\nThen the relief slowly turns to horror, as they realise what I just said. We\\'ve just held an impromptu staff meeting in the storeroom to evaluate the foulest odour to ever leave my body. \\n\\nI turn a shade of red to match the ketchup bottles as the chefs return to their stations, leaving me to wallow in my shame and flatulence, alone. \\n\\nAnd that\\'s the story of how I almost caused part of Heathrow airport to be evacuated. Also, I researched it later and those gas canisters only have carbon dioxide and nitrogen. It\\'s odourless and non-flammable. TIL, I guess. \\n\\ntl;dr Eggy fart was not a gas leak, no need to evacuate and call the fire department. Hey everyone. This happened a few weeks ago but I haven’t had time and just wanted to make sure everything had settled down before updating.\\n\\n[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bvg72z/tifu_by_thinking_my_daughter_was_being_raped_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)\\n\\nIn the original post I left out some details that caused a lot of confusion so I will clear those up now. When I went into the room I grabbed his shoulders and started screaming at him. He stood up and I pushed him down. I went over to my daughter to make sure she was okay and she was screaming that it was a fetish. Her bf was unconscious and we sat there trying to wake him up. He woke up and was conscious but was shocked/confused. He was wearing his jeans with his wiener out while they were having sex and was also shirtless, so I wrapped a blanket around him to cover his genitals and upper body and helped him into the car. In the car he zipped himself up and I gave him my sweater to wear. I realize now how my original post might sound like I was driving him around unconscious but I would have called the ambulance and not tried driving him myself as this would’ve been life or death so I’m sorry this was misleading. Hell, I probably wouldn’t have been able to carry him to the car (I’m just a strong but average sized lady :P) Anyways, since he was conscious at the hospital they just had a nurse check up on him but he had to wait to see a doctor so he was in the ER for a while. \\n\\nThe doctor did some scans and found that her bf (thankfully) didn’t have any injuries. He said that most likely her bf fainted since he didn’t hit anything on the way down and woke up shortly after. Her bf has also fainted before (long story) so thankfully he was unconscious due to the fainting and not the actual knockout. \\n\\nAfter the doctor determined he didn’t have any injuries I called his parents to tell them, and they decided they didn’t need to make the long trip. My daughter’s bf begged me not to tell them the specifics of what had happened so we kept it at that.\\n\\nFor my daughter, we had a conversation about her kink. She says she has a safe word and has never had to use it and her bf always takes care of her after sex to make sure she is okay and loved. I told her that I didn’t want her to be afraid to have sex at home because it’s a safe place and I don’t want her to feel bad over this. I installed a lock on her door as a little “I’m sorry” gift. I think this is something I should have done a while ago to give her some privacy, and I’m glad I’ve got that covered now. I also vowed to never have any surprise visits again. \\n\\nFor her bf I got him a card, some chocolate, and I paid for him to have a night at an Airbnb with her so they could have a private night together. \\n\\nTLDR; everything worked out in the end. Boyfriend wasn’t hurt, and daughter has a lock on her door now. Obligatory this didn\\'t happen today, but a few years ago - It still haunts me to this very day.\\n\\nSo a few years ago I was working as an admin assistant for a second-hand furniture company in the UK. It was a quiet day in the office, so my boss decided to send me out with a driver to remove the furniture from a lady\\'s bungalow who had sadly passed away.\\n\\nIt\\'s a hot day by English standards and I\\'m just enjoying being out on the road with the passenger window down catching a cooling breeze.\\n\\nEventually, we reach the little bungalow in a quiet, rural cul-de-sac and the driver and myself open the door and head inside.\\n\\nMost of the decorative and sentimental objects had already been removed (presumably by the family) and all that remained were larger items of furniture such as the big old TV and sofa etc. There were still some framed photographs on side-tables and it made me feel a little sad to look at the family portraits and stand in the middle of this living room knowing that the person who once lived here will never be coming home.\\n\\nAs we begin moving a sofa out to the truck outside, I start to get a stirring deep within my bowel.\\n\\nI\\'m normally pretty good at holding in a poo and boast a proud record of only having to shit outside once in my entire life.\\n\\nThis time, it felt different.\\n\\nInstead of a gentle tugging feeling in my lower-intestine to tell my brain \"I think you\\'re ready for a poo chap\" - it was a primal, guttural churning which radiated all the way from my stomach to my arsehole.\\n\\nI began to get nervous at this point - not yet a full-blown panic, but a dawning realisation that I am in trouble as little beads of sweat began to show up on my forehead and my palms became almost too clammy to grip the frame of the sofa.\\n\\nThis thing isn\\'t going to wait much longer. It is cooked to absolute perfection.\\n\\nThe drive back to the office is a full 45 minutes and I know deep down in my heart that I won\\'t survive the journey and would end up soiling myself in the truck which would be absolutely mortifying and as there doesn\\'t seem to be any woodland nearby, I make the executive decision there and then to deliver my payload in the downstairs toilet.\\n\\nQuickly helping the sofa onto the back of the truck, I legged it back into the bungalow without saying a word, leaving my colleague to ponder what had prompted such urgency.\\n\\nIn the soft light of the cupboard-sized bathroom, I hastily unbuttoned my trousers and pulled them around my ankles. As soon as the back of my thighs came into contact with the cool porcelain rim, this mighty brown basilisk folded out of me like a bicycle inner tube, much to the relief of my strained and exhausted colon.\\n\\nI felt an almost immediate sense of relief, I think I even laughed to myself - but what I found strange was there was no splash.\\n\\nNothing.\\n\\nMuch like Tom Cruise\\'s character in War of the World\\'s when he is observing the electrical storm from his back garden and commenting on the absence of thunder, I found myself wondering why the dense payload I had just ejected from my rectum had not \"spelunked\" in the water beneath me.\\n\\nIt turns out the water had been cut off to the bungalow some days ago. In my speed to purge the repulsive mass from my abdomen, I hadn\\'t noticed there was no water in the toilet.\\n\\nIt\\'s at this moment I catch a glimpse of myself in the bathroom mirror - dishevelled with my pants around my feet and the unmistakeable look of shame on my face, having just taken possibly the biggest shit of my career to date in this poor old dead lady\\'s toilet. Amongst all the cherished memories and memorabilia of a fellow Human Being\\'s life, I had taken a monstrous shit and couldn\\'t get rid of it.\\n\\nHow would I explain this to my boss?\\n\\nForget that - How would I explain this to the family?\\n\\nThey would come back to the bungalow at some point to remove the rest of their sweet old mum/grandma\\'s possessions and would find an unwelcome brown visitor nestled neatly in the toilet bowl, planted there by some disrespectful bastard.\\n\\nPlanted there by me.\\n\\nI tried dry-flushing this behemoth several times, but he wasn\\'t budging owing to its sheer size and material makeup. It remained steadfast in the bowl, looking up at me like a fat snake. Taunting me.\\n\\nI\\'m not a religious person by any means, but I felt so mortified by the unfurling situation that I started to apologise to the old lady and asking her for her forgiveness and understanding.\\n\\n\"I\\'m so so sorry. I couldn\\'t hold it in. I absolutely had to go. I had no choice. You understand don\\'t you? Don\\'t you? Please forgive me.\"\\n\\nExhausted of options, I sneaked back out of the toilet and closed the door behind me, closing the chapter on one of the most embarrassing moments of my life and headed back to the truck.\\n\\nAs we drove back to the office, I thought about it a lot. Nobody but myself knew what lurked behind that door under the stairs in that pretty little bungalow, but soon enough it would be discovered and questions would be asked. I thought maybe gravity would eventually do its level best to pull the faeces into the pipes and out of sight or maybe it was somehow possible Grandma had taken the dump before she passed away and nobody had noticed it dwelling in the downstairs toilet yet. In a way it became like Shroedingers poo - if the door remained closed, was it even still there? but I knew deep down the family were in for an unpleasant surprise.\\n\\nI never did hear what happened with the monstrous poo I left in a dead lady\\'s toilet in that quiet English cul-de-sac, but I have often thought about it in the years following.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR - I took a poo in a dead old lady\\'s toilet while removing furniture and couldn\\'t flush it away as the water had been cut off. It has been a source of guilt and shame ever since.\\n\\nEDIT: WOW thank you for the overwhelming response to my brown escapade. \\n\\nJust to clarify a few things - I didn’t know how a toilet works back then (always thought it was some kind of black magic) so I didn’t think getting some water was an option. I thought if I threw water down there it would fall into the pipe and be lodged there forever like a meaty monolith.\\n\\nThanks for the compliments on my writing - I really do enjoy it and am working on a novel (not about poo) - this was a true story though! This happened about 5 years ago, my soon to be husband and I were together for about 4 months and had just recently started having sex. I\\'m a doctor and used to seeing all kind of injuries, he on the other hand is a lot squeamish.\\n\\nThe weekend was coming and we were planning on not leaving the house at all, just stay inside and enjoy one another. \\nFriday came and went, everything amazing. Saturday rolls arround, we\\'re doing dress up, every position you can imagine, with some showering in between, it was a great time. \\nIt had gotten dark outside and we didn\\'t bother getting out of bed and turning on the lights just yet.  \\n\\nWe were getting it on, once again, and it all felt a lot wetter than all the previous times. I jump on up and do reverse cowgirl, a little bit rougher, as we both prefer.  \\n\\nWe finish, I get up to get a glass of water and turn on the lights. He looked at me and with an awkward smile on his face asked if it was that time of month. I look down, I\\'m COVERED in blood. It\\'s as if a I had just performed a goat sacrifice on my crotch. \\n\\nI knew it couldn\\'t have been that time of month, and, I also knew right away something had went really wrong. \\nI run towards him, take off the cover, and there is blood everywhere. I lift his penis up, there is a HUGE gash on one side, with torn skin dangling down, and blood pouring out. \\n\\nHe almost faints, I\\'m mortified, but there is no time for shame or awkwardness. I press on it and apologise to him, as he tries his best not to freak out.\\n\\nI got him patched up, he was on a sex ban for 3 months, but all is good now, we\\'re getting married this summer. Haven\\'t broken his penis since.\\n\\nTL;DR : I like it rough, the penis breaking type of rough.\\n\\nLATER EDIT: As I see it discussed in the comments , I felt it needed to be cleared up. My BF did not get a PENILE FRACTURE, the frenulum tore, he did not feel it because of numbing lube and the adrenaline of the moment, we continued so the tear also got bigger along one side of his penis, therefore the gash and hanging skin. \\n\\nI do not know how in God\\'s name I managed to do that, nor do I know if the costume I had on had anything to do with it, maybe the fishnets nicked the frenulum and the rough pounding did the rest. Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/cfbo0i/tifu_by_diving_into_a_pool_headfirst_degloving_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share \\n\\nAs per usual this didn\\'t happen today but this past Saturday. I (26f) was spending the day hanging out with friends by the pool, casually drinking and playing games. One of my friends decides to challenge me to a race to the other side of the pool. So we hop out and me, being the genius that I am, and very confident after being a competitive diver and swimmer for more than 10 years, decide to dive in from the shallow end. I go to take a running leap in and as I\\'m pushing off the deck, I feel my foot slip. I end up diving straight down, feel my neck crunch, and then blackout. I come to as I\\'m floating to the surface, back up, and tell my legs to just stand up cause I need to breath, but they don\\'t respond. Most of my friends see me and think I\\'m joking, but very luckily my nurse and med school friend see blood and rocket into action. They stabilize my neck and flip me over in the water to breath and then get me up on the pool deck. In another incredible bout of luck, once I\\'m stabilized on the deck I can move my legs again. Friends call an ambulance (to which I am groggily and vehemently opposed to, thanks US healthcare prices) and once I get to the hospital I\\'m placed in the trauma ICU and CT scanned. I then find out I\\'ve pulverized my c2 and broken c1 and c3. And now I get bed rest and at least 3 months in a C collar. So yeah, don\\'t dive in the shallow end folks! \\n\\nTldr: dove in the shallow end, wrecked my neck like a hydraulic press\\n\\nAfter urging from several redditors here\\'s my GoFundMe link. I\\'m a super poor masters degree student so any help would be incredibly appreciated!!! https://www.gofundme.com/help-offset-my-medical-bills\\n\\nPhotos: NSFW GRAPHIC: http://imgur.com/a/QCnX2wN **Gonna use a throwaway. I\\'m not giving my roommate the satisfaction of sharing this stupid shit of his on my actual account.** \\n\\nI had an essay to print out this weekend but since I no longer had my own printer, rest her poor soul, it meant driving down to the print shop. So, I wasted no time copying all my shit to a USB and grabbing my coat. I was literally just about to shut the door behind me when I heard my roommate calling my damn name. He wanted something printed out as well. A fucking flyer or some shit. Random, but ok whatever. \\n\\nHe asked if he could use my USB. I didn\\'t see why not, so I said sure. Once he was done copying the file from his laptop, he gave me back my USB and said: \"Valar Morgulis, motherfucker\". I said: \"Valar Dohearis, you degenerate turd\" and bounced. The print shop was busy when I got there but the wait was worth it because the girl who came to assist me was cute as fuck. Little did I know, this would only be the beginning of my humiliating downfall.\\n\\nI handed the cute print shop girl my USB with the simple instruction of printing out the two files on there. As far as I knew, there was nothing else on the USB except those two documents. Print shop girl stared at her computer screen before locking eyes again. Her expression was unreadable. Like she was trying hard not to show an emotion. She leaned in and sheepishly asked: \"Which two files, sir?\". I replied: \"Only the two you see on there\". \\n\\nAt that moment she turned the computer screen towards me and revealed that there was close to a dozen folders on there. Folders that never even existed when I copied my essay. Here\\'s the damn punchline. All these fucking folders were labeled with hardcore, homo-erotic descriptions:\\n\\n**\"TINY TWINK DRILLED HARD BY HANDSOME HANDYMAN\"**\\n\\n**\"COLLEGE STUD DRAINS HIS BIG UNCUT COCK\"** \\n\\n**\"CUTE BOY FUCKED IN THE ASS BY DADDY\"**\\n\\n**\"TEASING MY DRUNK STRAIGHT FRIEND WITH RAW DICK\"**\\n\\n**\"HIGH SCHOOL HUNKS FUCK BAREBACK\"** \\n\\n**\"HUNG DOCTOR GETS HEAD AFTER PHYSICAL\"**\\n\\n**\"PLANET OF THE BOTTOMS: DAWN OF DA DICK\"** \\n\\nThere were loads more, but I\\'m sure ya\\'ll get the pornographic picture. I shook my head in horror and said: \"That ain\\'t mine\". Print shop girl\\'s eyes narrowed and practically penetrated my fucking soul. \\n\\n\"What should I print for you, sir?\" \\n\\n\"It\\'s my roommate... he does this kinda shit\"\\n\\n\"Of course\"\\n\\n*Crickets*\\n\\nI swallowed what remained of my dignity and did what had to be done. \\n\\n\"Print the one called assignment, please. Under, uh... All Ass All Access. Thank you\"\\n\\n**Tl:dr I walked into my local print shop with an essay I had to print out. Walked out looking like a porn addict.**\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n\\n*Edit: Ya\\'ll giving me too much attention. Appreciate the rewards though. Just wanna provide feedback to some of the comments. I requested that print shop girl expand the display settings to show the number of files in each folder. All the folders had 0 files except one: \"All Ass All Access\". That\\'s how I located my essay. For the record, I\\'m not gonna revenge-prank my damn roommate by fucking him. Also, this throwaway isn\\'t to hide this post from him, I just don\\'t wanna have him think these little stunts of his are worthy of living on the Reddit account I use daily. Hence, an account that will eventually become obsolete. Valar Morghulis, ya\\'ll.* Obligatory stuff: This is not a throwaway account. I\\'ll just own this one. This actually started in May 2019 but was only discovered today.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo my close friends and I have a few on going group chats. They are all variations of like the same 10 people but I\\'ve know them all for decades and on my iPhone I\\'ve just been adding numbers to their contact profiles for well over a decade at this point. \\n\\n\\nSo in May 2019, I started a new group chat that shuffled a few folks around to keep up with texting preferences. (you know some people wanted in, some people wanted to take a break. It happens. NBD)  \\n\\n\\nSo I add in my friends, and I\\'m just clicking on their names without looking at the numbers (cause who looks at contacts numbers anymore?) well I don\\'t know how but one of my friends got added with an old number. It still worked and he\\'s pretty busy so nobody thinks it\\'s a big deal that he never chimes in. \\n\\n\\nFast forward to late February / Early March 2020 for obvious reasons we all start texting a bit more than usual.  So my friend Scott, starts chiming in a bit but it\\'s in the Cyrillic alphabet. We can\\'t tell if he is joking around or what so we run it through google translate. Google doesn\\'t understand all of it but it\\'s a lot of fucks in between indecipherable garbage.  We all laugh and joke about it and send him links on how to change his default language back to English because that would totally happen to Scott. \\n\\n\\nSo a week or two later he responds again in what we think is Russian (google wasn\\'t really sure with all the garbage translation) So we are all laughing at Scott and run it through google translate again. Same thing: a bunch of fucks and random nonsense. \\n\\n\\nAny way fast forward to today. We\\'re giving \"Russian\" Scott hell on the group chat because this is either some really stupid joke or he\\'s a dumb ass and can\\'t fix his phone. We are cracking up and dying from laughter, when real Scott calls me. \\n\\n\\nHe\\'s worried about the world and a bit down because he hasn\\'t heard from us in awhile. I\\'m like what? Haven\\'t you been playing some kind of Russian joke on us lately? We thought you were just text lurking. We trade notes and quickly figure out that the wrong number had been added to the chat and his old number (with a US area code) had somehow become a Russian spam number and he hadn\\'t heard from us in almost a year! \\n\\n\\nUmm Oops. So now I\\'m trying to figure out the best way to send him a year\\'s worth of a stupid group text to help him feel included again. We missed his birthday from his perspective, and Christmas. Of course, we celebrated all of that with Angry Russian Scott! \\n\\n\\n\\nTl;dr  I screwed a friend\\'s number up on a group text almost a year ago and didn\\'t realize till today we\\'d been hanging out with a Russian spammer and our friend felt abandoned.\\n\\nEdit: If anyone knows a way to forward a years worth of texting on an iPhone to a different number, I’d love some advice. Preferably a way to do it on the phone itself?\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit 2: Because Redditors never believe anything here’s some screen shots. I tried to hide my actual friends personal stuff. Guys I’m sorry if I did a bad job. \\n\\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/gallery/Z3KrXIS\\n\\nEdit 3: I understand they are not a spammer now and edit 2 has been updated with a number redacted link.\\n\\n\\nEdit 4: I added line breaks for better reading oh and Thanks for all the awards! Y’all I’m still cracking up constantly about this! So this actually happened back in high school. Tried to come up with a better title but this was the best I could do. \\n\\nSO I’ve always been pretty busty. In HS I frequently used to wear tank tops to school (summers were brutal) and during lunch my friends would make it a game to try and throw food in between my breasts. \\n\\n(Disclaimer: this sounds horrible but it really wasn’t, we were all just messing around and they’d only throw things like grapes, carrots, Cheetos etc. It was kind of like a competition and tbh pretty entertaining). \\n\\nAnyway, one day they’re trying to throw baby carrots at my boobs and I guess one throw was particularly well aimed because it went straight down my bra. We all laugh about it, and I spend a minute digging around my bra trying to find it. But I guess I must have missed it, or another carrot was also in my bra or something. \\n\\nAfter lunch my friend and I head to our English class. We had this awesome male teacher that everyone loved. During class I had to ask him a question so I got up and walked over to him. After I talked with him I turned around to leave when he said: “uh.... is that your carrot?”\\n\\nI turned back around and we both just stared at this wilted baby carrot on the ground between us. It’s this moment where I know he’s wondering how TF that carrot fell out of my body, and I’m thinking about how I dropped my titty carrot in front of my favorite teacher. \\n\\nI kind of just slowly pick the carrot up, say “.....yes....” and go back to my seat. \\n\\nMy friends still make fun of me for this. \\n\\nTLDR Carrot fell out of my bra and my teacher asked if it was mine. So my girl and I had a great night planned. I made reservations at her favorite restaurant. She got a sexy little number to wear for \"after dinner\" and sent me teasing texts all day. She absolutely loved the flowers I got her, and she presented me with a bouquet of homemade beef jerky. She then proceeded to spend, I kid you not, 3 hours getting ready.  She looked friggin\\' amazing though. We were both starving and she was really looking forward to a night out. \\n\\nSo we get to the restaurant and get seated. The only menu they give us is this valentine\\'s day special. I do some quick mental math and realize *this dinner is going to cost me close to $300.* \\n\\nOh. Hell. NO. \\n\\nSo my GF looks up from the wine list and sees I am antsy. She asks what\\'s wrong. I mumble something about their prices having gone up. She asked if I wanted to go somewhere else and I jumped on it. Practically raced out of there. She followed along and sheepishly made excuses to the wait staff. \\n\\nSo we get back to the car and I apologized and told her $300 was ridiculous for one dinner and she was like \"wait? what? It wasn\\'t that much\" \\n\\nTurns out the menu prices were *per couple* not per person like I had thought. \\n\\nOnce I realized that dinner would in fact have been in my budget. I tried to get her to go back to the restaurant. This is where I *really* fucked up. She kept saying no and that she didn\\'t want to. She said she would be too embarassed to go back. I said that was ridiculous and I didn\\'t understand why and I kept trying to get her to go back. Then she suddenly burst into tears and sobs \"Why. Aren\\'t. You. LISTENING? It doesn\\'t matter WHY all that matters is that it DOES. WHY do you want to push me into something that makes me feel so uncomfortable?\"\\n\\nAh fuck. She kinda had a point. I apologize and drive her home. I asked if she wanted to go to any of the other restaurants on our route home. She said no since she \"looked like shit\" since her make up got all messed up from crying. (She didn\\'t. She still looked gorgeous) \\n\\nWe get home and I don\\'t think anyone on the face of the planet has ever gotten changed from fancy clothes to sweats as fast as she did. I tried apologizing again, she said it was OK but she just wanted to be alone for a while. \\n\\nNow she and the cat are in the other room watching true crime documentaries. \\n\\nTL;DR I ruined date night by thinking the restaurant was over priced and leaving (It wasn\\'t) then not listening to her. Now girlfriend and cat are probably plotting how to get away with my murder.\\n\\nEDIT: Just to clear up some confusion from the way I worded it. Dinner was not $150 per person. They were doing a V day special where for $150 you got dinner, dessert, champagne and flowers for 2. \\n\\nEDIT 2: Wow! I can\\'t believe how this blew up! Thanks everyone! Of course my first reddit gold is on a throw away. LOL but thank you! \\nAlso... fuck. Girlfriend has indeed found this post. I got a \"Did you post about last night on reddit?\" text from her this morning. \\n\\nEDIT 3: cat tax http://imgur.com/gallery/r2gMAQQ This happened a few hours ago but I need to back up to last night to give a proper explanation.   \\n\\nI’ve started watching Chernobyl on HBO since GOT is over. I’m digging it so far and watched episode 3 last night. There’s a scene where a group of 100 guys are digging tunnels under the nuclear reactor and it’s hot. They can’t use fans due to dust and blah blah blah so these men strip completely naked while they work. My immature ass thinks this is HILARIOUS! I saw more junk in that 30 second scene than I’ve seen in 10 years. I’m giggling like a middle schooler pointing at all the penises. My boyfriend didn’t find it as funny, but that’s another story. The episode ends, all is well and I go to bed.  \\n\\nThen, this morning is when the fuck up happens. I’m chatting with some coworkers during break and someone asks me how my night was. My poor attempt at being funny was to respond with, “It was pretty awesome, I saw a bunch of naked miners.” Everybody kind of froze and just stared at me....I didn’t clue in for the longest time. I just stared blankly back at them. Nobody laughed at all and I could feel my anxiety closing my throat when it dawned on me. They thought I said naked MINORS! \\n\\nThe English language is fucked up sometimes!   I quickly explained what I was actually talking about. Everybody got a great kick out of it but I’m still the office creep now.  \\n\\nTL:DR I said I saw a bunch of naked MINERS, but everyone thought I said naked MINORS. So this incident was actually this past Friday, when I settled in after a long week to watch a movie with my parents.  A couple of minutes in, let loose a big yawn because I was a little worn out after a long week at my internship.  Suddenly I felt my jaw kind of “click” into place, which happens sometimes but I can almost always just close it back normally.  I should point out that one time about two years ago I did the same thing and had a big yawn and couldn’t close my mouth for about 2 minutes, but eventually that sorted itself out.\\n\\nSo after this past incident I assumed that this time the same would happen, that my jaw would just go back into place and let me close my mouth after a few minutes.  In the meantime, I was frantically googling how to fix my jaw.  After about a half hour of unsuccessful googling (pretty much every result for “jaw dislocation” was “go to the hospital”) and trying to hide what was going on from my parents I decided to give up fixing it myself and go see a professional.  I obviously couldn’t talk so I had to text my dad, who was sitting in the same room, to tell him what was going on.  After a few minutes of trying unsuccessful techniques he came up with, my mom forced us to go to the ER.\\n\\nNow at this point both of the joints on the sides of my face are in a lot of pain, but the worst part is really the saliva, because I can’t swallow or spit, so it’s just pooling up in mouth with nowhere to go.  I’ve got a towel with me but by this point it’s almost completely covered in spit (and I accidentally placed it in my lap so it looks like I had pissed myself too).  As I get to the ER my dad goes away to park the car, leaving me to have to explain myself to the the workers there by typing in the Notes app until my dad got there to fill in the gaps in my story.  I should also point out that we decided to go to the smaller, older hospital about 5 minutes from our house rather than the than the enormous, brand new one 15 minutes away on the other side of town.\\n\\nAs I get placed into a bed, a large, strong-looking doctor comes in tries to do the typical jaw reduction technique on me, to no avail.  He tells the nurses to start me on a muscle relaxant, only to find that the most effective one (I’m not sure what it was, I was put on so many drugs that other night I’ve lost track of names) was not in stock at this hospital so they gave me a larger dose of a less potent drug.  A few minutes after being giving the relaxants he tried again to fix my jaw, to no avail.  They added more painkiller and muscle relaxant to my IV and he tried again to reposition my jaw.  This time as he was pushing, in part due to the drugs but also due to me gagging I started throwing up on the doctor.  Around midnight they decided to give my a CT scan to make sure that all I had was a jaw dislocation and not any sort of fracture, and on the way back the CT scan room the nurse had me to stop off in a bathroom to puke my guts out.  The doctor tried one more time to reposition my jaw before giving up.  He claimed it was the first time in his 15 years that he couldn’t fix a dislocated jaw manually.\\n\\nAt this point the only remaining option was to send me to a larger hospital in the city (this small one didn’t have the proper staff available) about 25 minutes away, where they be able to put me to sleep and finally get my jaw back in place.  Somewhere around 3am I made it to the bigger hospital where multiple doctors tried the same technique as the first guy, all without success.  Finally they gave me a pretty huge dose (I’m a pretty big guy) of anesthetic to finally put me under and fix my jaw.  My dad, who had stayed by my side and awake this whole time (meanwhile I had been drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the night), described them finally getting my mouth to close as similar to the scene in King Kong where he defeats the T-Rex and proceeds to play with dinosaur’s jaw.  I have to give my dad so much credit here for staying awake until we got home 7am, driving me to and from the hospital (even though I offered to drive home in spite of all of the drugs I was on), staying by my side during this whole ordeal, on Father’s Day weekend no less!  Also as icing on top of the cake, when I finally got home and tried to lay down, my mom made me put on different clothes, and at which point I proceeded to vomit into my balled up pants.  I spent the rest of the day in a daze but am feeling good now.  Sadly soft foods only for the next few weeks.\\n\\ntl;dr yawned too big while watching a movie, dislocated my jaw in doing so, then spent the next 8 hours in the ER on all kinds of drugs and throwing up everywhere\\n\\nAlso, Happy Father’s Day to all the dads out there, I know I certainly appreciate mine a heck of a lot right now for being willing to spend the first part of his Father’s Day weekend in the hospital with me.\\n\\nEdit: thanks for the support everyone, as I said I’m doing well now and insurance should cover the majority of the expenses, all in all just glad that this was only one crappy night and nothing further.\\n\\nEdit 2: for anyone wondering the movie was Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring This actually took place a couple of years ago.\\n\\nI had just gotten a brand new job that I was really excited about. So I was delighted when my boss - who I had been trying to establish a rapport with - invited me and my husband over to her home for dinner. \\n\\nWell, mostly delighted. My husband is..... well... he\\'s the sweetest, but he has a history of doing really dumb shit. Because of this, I was worried about him coming along. \\n\\nBy the time the day of the dinner arrived, I had become so anxious about it that I actually floated the idea by my boss that I wasn\\'t sure if he would be able to make it. She was clearly taken aback and responded \"Oh no! I really hope he can, I have a dinner for 3 all ready to go.\" Upon seeing her dismay, I assured her that I was sure he would find a way to be there. \\n\\nWell, we made it over to her apartment on time and things actually started out really, really well. It was actually just the 3 of us, which surprised me somewhat but made me a little less concerned about my husband - as crowds really tend to bring out his unpredictability.\\n\\nI had just started to finally relax and was a couple bites into a deliciously cooked steak when things took a horrible... *horrible* turn. \\n\\nMy boss had just stepped into the kitchen to check on dessert when I noticed something odd out of the corner of my eye. It was one of those things where you know something strange his happening in your peripheral, but you\\'re not sure what... you have to look over and focus your gaze to really comprehend it.\\n\\nI look over at my husband and see him holding his steak in his hand, hovering it just an inch or two above his plate. Before I had a chance to fully comprehend what I was seeing and verbalize something that might have saved all of us from the coming horror.... he threw his steak - baseball style - across the room straight into the dining room window. It hit the window, making a loud noise, and slowly slid down. \\n\\nNow my husband does dumb shit, I already told you that. But he\\'s not a crazy person. Usually when he does dumb shit I at least understand what he\\'s thinking. There\\' usually some semblance of rhyme or reason to the dumb shit.\\n\\nIn this case I was just dumbfounded. I couldn\\'t believe my eyes. I couldn\\'t wrap my head around what was going on. I stared at him with what must have been the most confused look, and watched as he stared back at me, an expression of utter horror painted across his face. \\n\\nI couldn\\'t make any sense of what was happening, but I also didn\\'t have time to try. I heard the foot steps of my boss, coming to see what the sound was.\\n\\nIt suddenly sunk in that it didn\\'t matter *why* he did what he did. He did it and we were all about to come face to face with a very awkward situation. \\n\\nI could feel the anger flush through my face. For a brief moment I contemplated trying to help my husband get out of this. But No. This was his dumb-shit-bed and he could lie in it. Not like there was any possible recovery anyway.\\n\\nMy boss walks in and sees the steak lying on the window sill There\\'s the fucking longest most awkward pause where we all just sit there frozen. My boss and I are staring at my husband, forcing the ball into his court, as the cringe just hangs in the air like an ocean fog.\\n\\nHe finally manages to mutter some incoherent garbage about being a clutz and even tries to get me to back him up. I leave his ass out to dry in the deafening silence. \\n\\nHe makes a poor attempt at cleaning the window and retrieves his steak. Mercifully, my boss asks me a question about work and we both dive eagerly into conversation.\\n\\nWe all resume the rest of the evening pretending that he isn\\'t there, a sort of unspoken agreement by all that this is the only way to move forward.\\n\\nAs soon as we got to the car, my husband turned into a nervous chatterbox trying to explain himself.\\n\\nTurns out the dumbass didn\\'t like the way his steak was cooked (rare) and - get this - he *thought the window was open*. My husband, ladies and gentleman, tried to chuck his steak out a 3-story window. He thought that was a reasonable solution to being served an under-cooked steak. \\n\\nA year or so later my boss hosted a Christmas party for the company at her newly-built home. My best friend, Jennie, was my +1.\\n\\nTL;DR: Took my husband to dinner at my boss\\' house. He thought his steak was undercooked, thought the window was open, and thought throwing his steak through the window was a reasonable idea.\\n\\n**Note:** My husband [told this TIFU from his perspective a couple years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/3im341/tifu_by_throwing_my_steak_out_a_window/) and it was a popular post. Someone suggested I should tell it from my perspective. Hope our discomfort brings a little joy to you fine redditors :)\\n\\n**Edit:** OK Guys, I probably overplayed the \"dumb shit\" angle. Yeah, he\\'s known for acting without thinking things through, but this one moment does not represent the norm.  From my perspective, in this moment, he looked like a looney bin character gone mad... which is what makes the story so funny in retrospect. Go read his perspective and his actions look at least a *little* bit less crazy. My husband is a fun-loving, kind husband and father who makes life very fun. \\n\\n**Edit 2:** No my husband is not on the spectrum or crazy, although I get that that may seem like a valid conclusion if all you know is this one event. The usual dumb shit is more of your everyday impulsiveness, like immediately saying the slightly inappropriate thing that comes to mind. If he would\\'ve done that, it wouldn\\'t have shocked me at all. This, of course, shocked me, because he *normally doesn\\'t do things that make him look insane*.  Not sure why some seem to be taking the \"he often does dumb shit\" to mean \"he often does completely insane things\", when I feel like I was making the exact opposite point. Oh well. Glad that most of you got some small bit of enjoyment out of your day from the story.  Also, we all have our faults. I joke about my husband not thinking things through, he jokes about my preoccupation with what others think of me, etc, etc. I like many people in adulthood have had to deal with the annoyance of overgrown tonsils. From the 3 – 4 times a year tonsillitis, to the sleep apnoea that they cause. Personally, I wanted my tonsils gone.\\n\\nAfter getting tonsillitis for the second time this year I decided enough is enough, I booked an appointment with my GP, referred to the surgeon and made a date for the surgery.\\n\\nI was warned that I was in for the sorest throat of my life and that it was going to be agony for a while. Which was ok, how bad could it be?\\n\\nDay 1: I was prepped and ready to go, surprisingly not too nervous for my first major surgery. The procedure went well, my tonsils were gone and I was all set to recover in hospital. The pain wasn’t too high yet, I was still spaced out from the drugs, so all in all the first night was quite easy.\\n\\nDay 2:\\n\\n4AM: I woke up needing to go to the bathroom, I felt like I needed to spit so I rushed over to the bathroom sink. I spat out a few mouthfuls of blood not thinking too much of it. I slowly shuffled back to my bed and quickly fell back asleep.\\n\\n7:30AM: This time I awoke to a lot of pain, I buzzed the nurse to get my dose of Endone and Panadol. I mentioned to her that I had bled a little overnight. She was immediately concerned, she passed me a plastic cup and told me to spit all the blood that comes up from now.\\n\\n(I thought that leaking blood would be common as it was when I got my wisdom teeth out.)\\n\\nFor the next few hours slowly but surely I was filling up this cup that looked more and more like red wine. It was horrible because the pain was quite high regardless of the pain killers, I couldn’t lie down an rest as the blood would go in to my stomach.\\n\\n10PM: The nurses tried to use an ice pack on my neck and give me countless icy poles to freeze the blood but nothing was working, I had filled almost two cups now and they decided it was time to call my surgeon.\\nThey broke the bad news to me and told me I needed to be prepped for surgery again. I was surprisingly ok with it. I remained calm and collected. I went through the procedure again of getting countless needles and being sedated. (FUN!)\\n\\nPost second surgery: I was back where I was today but hopefully no more bleeding! The surgeon informed me that a blood vessel had haemorrhaged around my tonsil area causing blood to leak. I had to have blood sucked out of my stomach because I had indeed swallowed quite a bit of blood.\\n\\nHe told me that this complication only happens once a year for him! (Lucky me.)\\n\\nDay 3-4:\\n\\nThe recovery was brutal and painful, I was in bed all day, struggling to get any solids down as the pain was too bad to swallow. However, no complications.\\n\\nDay 5:\\nFor anyone who has had the pleasure of having a tonsillectomy you would know the most painful part about it is waking up from a snooze.\\n\\nI learnt that the best thing to do is get up, drink some water and have some meds ASAP!\\n\\nI was getting out of the shower when I felt a large amount of liquid in my mouth, I leaned over the sink and spat out blood.\\n\\nHere is a picture of the sink: https://m.imgur.com/kpxtoMf\\n\\nMy mum, who had been amazing throughout this whole thing, was luckily around the corner from my home when this happened. So I called her and we decided the safest bet would be returning to hospital.\\n\\nI felt very unwell in the car ride, and I was pale as a ghost. They quickly put an IV in and gave me fluids.\\n\\nAfter a VERY long wait we were advised by my surgeon to return home and come back in if it were to happen again.\\n\\nI returned home and rested up for a few hours, it was around 9PM when I felt the same liquid taste in the back of my throat. This time I knew. I rushed to the bathroom and proceeded to cough up blood.\\n\\nHere’s a photo of this time: http://imgur.com/s2YFx39\\n\\nAs you can see, it’s a lot more this time around.\\n\\nI don’t know if you have ever had the displeasure of coughing up blood but the worst part about it is just how sticky blood is. It sticks to your tongue, throat and lips, resulting in blood clots getting stuck in your mouth. It’s horrible.\\n\\nI called my mum and she rushed over to come get me.\\n\\nBack to hospital again and another IV :)\\n\\nI was admitted back to the ward and I stayed overnight, my night wasn’t overly dramatic. I bled once around 3-4AM but it only lasted 5 minutes so there wasn’t much for concern.\\n\\nDAY 6!!!!\\n\\nThings were looking ok, I was still in a lot of pain but I had not bled outside of the little one in the morning.\\n\\n1PM: I was watching shitty daytime TV as I reached to have a sip of water, I felt that same feeling in my throat come on and it felt heavy quick.\\n\\nI had no time to react so I grabbed the smoothie cup I had received from my mum and proceeded to spit mouthfuls of blood in to it. I was trying to get a hold of my buzzer to notify the nurse.\\n\\nThey came in shortly after and rushed to get me a vomit bag, it was coming FAST. The nurses were trying to keep me calm and they again put an ice pack behind my neck to try and slow down the bleeding. I kept coughing it up. I started making gagging noises as the blood was sticking and clotting around my throat.\\n\\nI started to feel light headed. Within seconds of saying that, I fainted.\\n\\nI woke up seconds later to the ward now being in Code Blue, I had never seen so many nurses and doctors in one room so fast. There must have been 15-20 people in this small room. I had needles going in to my arms, an oxygen mask being put on, and multiple nurses and doctors talking to me.\\n\\n“Raph, stay with us.”\\n\\n“Raph, look at me, keep your eyes open.”\\n\\nThis was the first time in my life that I was genuinely scared for my life.\\n\\nI could overhear that they were trying to get a hold of my surgeon, because once again I needed emergency surgery.\\n\\nI was rushed into theatre and they prepped me again. Giving me another IV there was a delay because my surgeon was finishing up surgery for another patient at another hospital.\\n\\nIt was at this moment where I broke down crying. I felt so sick, all I could taste was blood, I was scared, alone. I didn’t know what was going to happen to me. All the while I was still coughing up a lot of blood.\\n\\nAfter some time had passed, the nurse with me was starting to panic.\\n\\n“We need to get him into theatre now!”\\n\\nThey kept trying to give me oxygen but I kept coughing blood into the mask.\\n\\nMy surgeon arrived and I was put to sleep.\\n\\nI woke up in unbearable pain and agony, it was the worst pain I had felt since this whole thing began. But that quickly changed when I was given morphine.\\n\\nI rested up and was eventually moved back into the ward and I was greeted by my mum and nan. My poor mother had been through hell. She had only just before it all went down. She was bawling her eyes out the whole time I was going through it all, blaming herself for leaving :(\\n\\nDay 7:\\n\\nI got a big sleep and I woke up to my surgeon checking in on me. He was truly sorry for my ordeal, and said I was the worst he had ever seen.\\n\\nThe cause was the same as last time, a vessel had opened up and caused the bleeding.\\n\\nAll in all I lost 800ml of blood from that ordeal. That’s almost a fifth of total blood!\\n\\nIt’s crazy to think that if I wasn’t in the ward when it happened there was a good chance I could have died.\\n\\nDay 8-9:\\n\\nI stayed in hospital. Everyone agreed that it was the best place for me, just in case thunder struck three times.\\n\\nI was pretty shook on Day 8 still, but as soon as word got out that it went from standard procedure to almost fatal I was receiving a lot of love from my family and friends.\\n\\nTwitch kept me sane throughout my stay. All my streaming buddies reached out and wished me well which all contributed to making me feel better.\\n\\nDay 10:\\n\\nI am typing to you all from my phone! This is probably the longest thread I have ever written on Reddit and I don’t normally post much but I wanted to share my story because this will stick with me for the rest of my life.\\n\\nEach day I’m feeling more and more strong. My pain still sucks but it’s getting less severe and I haven’t bled since! I’m out of hospital being taken very well taken care of by my mother.\\n\\nAs cliché as it sounds, this whole experience made me very grateful not only for my life, but more importantly the doctors, nurses, surgeons, paramedics etc. that go through so much stress to help us fellow humans live the lives we live.\\n\\nI can’t wait to be back in full health and hopefully I can play some games and get some streams in before I go back to work! ;)\\n\\nTL;DR: I got the procedure of getting my tonsils out. Unfortunately due to complications I needed multiple emergency surgeries. After a few days of rest from the second procedure, I started to bleed excessively. Which quickly made me faint turning the hospital into a code red state. I lost a significant amount of blood and I was prepped for a third and final procedure that saved my life.\\n\\nEDIT: A small amount of you requested my Twitch, here it is: twitch.tv/wristyplum :)\\n\\nThankyou so much for all the kind words. I really did not expect this to blow up as it has. Y’all are so nice!\\n\\nEDIT 2: You guys have asked for an update so here it is:\\n\\nI’m feeling so much better, the pain is no where near as bad! Today was the first day I woke up and didn’t straight away need painkillers, I’m able to eat whole meals with a side of water to help wash it down. \\n\\nMy happiness is so high due to the fact that I’m feeling more and more like me again not this zonked out zombie!\\n\\nI still can’t believe how many people this post has affected. My intentions were never for it to go “viral” I just wanted to tell my story mostly for me, When it was still fresh in my mind. I could express myself and always look back on this moment in life, but now because of everyone’s support and love I’ll look back on it in ways I could never imagined! It\\'s that time of year and I just got back from visiting the Doctor of the Womanly Nethers.\\n\\nSo, there I am, reclining in the stirrups, practicing my relaxing breathing techniques (these things make me nervous)...and the Dr. asked if I have a dog.\\n\\nMy brain just could not relate what was going on Down Under and that particular question, and it was like\\n\\nW\\n\\nT\\n\\nF\\n\\nOK, first of all, yes, yes, I do. I do have a dog. I love my pupper.  And honestly, that hair does get just \\\\*everywhere\\\\*, and my dumb ass instantly thought there was dog hair all over my coochie-goodies, so I asked her \"Um...is that a problem...down...there...?\"\\n\\nShe paused just a moment, the kind of moment I realize now is the \"Must. Not. Laugh. In. Patient\\'s. Face. Moment. She looked me in the eyes and carefully said, \"Your face mask. It has dog bones on it. I thought you might have a dog.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL; DR OB/GYN asked me if I had a dog while looking between my legs, I thought I had dog hair there, but she was asking about my face mask with the dog-bone pattern. This did actually happen today, as the clock had just barely struck midnight and Christmas was upon us. Also, this is my throwaway because dammit, I\\'ll not have this following me to my actual account.\\n\\nI was in the laundry room which doubles as the storage room, where belongings go to die. I saw a book that did not immediately appear to be a journal on one of the shelves, so I grabbed it and flipped it open to the middle. I recognized my younger brother\\'s handwriting and knew I had wandered onto private property, but my eyes lingered a little too long on the page. \\n\\nMy brother has been out of the house for several years. He deployed to Afghanistan and got married when he returned to the States. He\\'s always been a little weird but we (mostly) accept his quirks as just social anxiety and move on. But there I was, in the asscrack of Christmas morning holding a journal that he obviously had written during his teenage years. It was one of those journals that ask you questions and you fill in the answers, and of course the question I opened to was \"what\\'s something you hope no one ever finds out about you?\"\\n\\nThere, staring at me from the page was the following sentence: \"that I had sex with one of the cows.\"\\n\\nYes, we grew up on a farm. I don\\'t believe he was speaking merely of a corpulent maiden. \\n\\nI consider myself open minded, and have prepared myself for various scenarios with my siblings. What if they come out as gay or trans, what if they become addicts, what if they end up in prison, what if they were to join the circus. I have never entertained the possibility of \"what if they romanced the livestock.\" Life just doesn\\'t prepare you for random bestiality. \\n\\nTl;dr I found out my brother dabbled in bovine sexual escapades and now I live in a world where I just have to know that and pretend I don\\'t. This actually happened a week ago but I just found out about it today.\\n\\nMy brother rents a studio in NYC but he\\'s been out of town for work. I went up to visit some friends and he said it\\'d be fine if I stayed at his place. When I got there the wall lights worked but for some reason none of the floor lamps did. There were 5 different floor lamps and none of them would turn on. There was also recently a power outage that affected the same area his studio is in so being the bright man that I am I figured that the power coming back must have fried the bulbs. Being a good brother I went out and bought brand new bulbs and threw out the broken ones. \\n\\nToday my brother got back and gave me a call asking if I replaced his light bulbs. I told him I did and not to worry about it but his old ones were broken so I replaced them. Turns out they weren\\'t broken, they were just smart bulbs linked to his smart speaker. They were $60 a piece so I effectively threw out $300 of smart bulbs.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR Brightest bulb in the closet threw out hundreds of dollars in smart bulbs So as usual, this wasn\\'t today but last weekend.\\nAfter a busy workweek where me and my husband had been coming home, and pretty much passing out at the end of the day, we figured a Saturday afternoon would be the perfect time for some quality alone time.\\nI\\'d been teasing him for the morning whilst we did general household chores and finally dragged him upstairs mid afternoon to get down to business! \\n\\nEverything started off brilliantly, the clothes got thrown, things got hot and quickly led into some excellent 69ing.\\nNow, my husband is deft of finger and pretty quickly had me moaning with pleasure and a very intense orgasm. \\nWe quickly switched to him on top and i was encouraging him to go harder so that he could have a great finish as well. Still all good so far! I continued to egg him on, telling him to step up his game and FINISH HIM. (no body slam moves required)\\n....\\n\\nAfter a particularly enthusiastic thrust I suddenly got a stab of pain in my side, making me curl up in agony. He mistook this for intense pleasure (apparently my pain face is similar to my sexy face? Not sure how to take that one!) and kept going for a couple more plunges before it finally became obvious to him as I burst into tears!\\n\\nThis lead into him panicking that he\\'d somehow broken me with his cock (he may be overestimating there) and me trying to figure out WTF had just happened and why I was crying. I\\'m guessing it something to do with the lovely stabbing cramps in my right hand side of my abdomen. Possibly.\\nCue the naked running around as he grabs hot water bottle and glass of water while I curl up on the bed, now very lacking in sex appeal.\\n\\nTurns out that if you have PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome), \\'enthusiastic exercise\\' can sometimes cause a ovarian cyst to get over excited and burst! \\n\\nWorst part was, we were trying to fit in this fun time before his parents came over for dinner and now, 20 minutes before they arrive am now stuck in an ungainly position on the bed, totally starkers for all to see. \\nI had to phone his mum to ask if she had any ibuprofen she could bring round for me as we had none in the house and then had to try and explain exactly why I needed them. Luckily she had the sense to not ask any further questions when i said it can be triggered by certain types of exercise.\\n\\nManaged to get husband to help me pull some clothes on moments before they arrived, so saved some of my dignity at last.\\nHe\\'s now convinced his dick is cursed and is going to break me again.\\n\\nTL;DR- Top thrust, cyst bust!  I\\'ve been getting telemarketer calls incessantly for months and it\\'s driving me insane, most of the time I just hang up once I hear them because I\\'m also expecting important calls from unknown numbers.\\n\\n I was with some friends one night and we decided to order some food from our regular place, the card machine was broken and I had no cash on me so I gave the delivery driver my details and she said she\\'d come back to my house with the working credit card reader the next night. \\n\\nFast forward a few weeks and nearly 50 spam calls from telemarketers, I\\'d completely forgotten about the previous order. I get a call on my phone and I hear an Asian woman ask for me, mispronouncing my last name, not unlike many telemarketers. Fed up with it I yell \"No, he\\'s not here because he died!\"\\n\\nNot even two hours later there\\'s a knock on my door, it was the sweet delivery lady and she brought a free meal for my household as a sympathy gift to help everyone through the ordeal of my death, while telling us not to worry about the bill from the other week.\\n\\nI had my friend drop off enough money for both meals without explaining it because I felt so bad. I can\\'t explain it to them without sounding racist and now I have to find a new Chinese restaurant.\\n\\nTL:DR - Thought the Asian delivery lady was a telemarketer, told her I died and she sent a sympathy meal to my family.\\n\\n\\nEdit: Thanks kind strangers for my first ever gold and silver!  It never really made sense why over the course of three years I never got one comment or upvote/downvote for all of my posts. Reddit is an absolutely huge site, but after a couple years you begin to have your doubts. I decided to check to see if I could see my posts in an incognito browser and saw that none of my posts existed. What the fuck?! It was at that moment I realized that from my first post I was shadow banned and all of my contributions over three years never was viewed by a soul. I can\\'t fucking believe I never caught onto it sooner. I\\'ve had my hand raised for three years and no one could ever see me and I never questioned it.\\n\\n*check my post history to see the barren world.  This happened yesterday. I\\'m 23M and I study IT and as you can imagine we have a lot more guys than girls over here.\\n\\nBackstory: So our small group of friends includes one girl and 3 guys including me and we make a fair number of sexist and racist jokes. When someone in the group says something and another person misses it and asks to repeat it, we tell that person that \"You know what makes you deaf? Sucking a lot of dick\". Okay saying it like this sounds pretty stupid but believe me it\\'s funny in person. \\n\\nThe fuckup: I\\'m going home from university and I\\'m standing in the bus stop. My phone starts to ring. For some reason I don\\'t notice it and it just keeps ringing. Eventually a girl comes up and tells me that she thinks my phone is ringing. A normal person would have said \"Ohh thanks\" but what did I say? Of course I said \"Oh well you know I suck a lot of dick\". She just stared at me for a second and then walked to the opposite end of the bus stop. FML.\\n\\nTL;DR: Didn\\'t notice that phone rang, random girl alerts me, I tell her that I suck a lot of dick because it\\'s an inside joke. Quick disclaimer: This was a year ago.\\n\\nI\\'m a huge history nerd and I absolutely love exploring ancient sites. My mother and I took a trip to Greece and were on a tourbus.\\n\\nOne of our many stops were Nafplio (which was absolutely beautiful) and our tour guide said \"If you climb 999 steps, you\\'ll find the beautiful fortress of Paladimi. The entire bus chuckled (Mainly middle aged, few elders.) But being the teenage self I am, I was determined to climb those steps.\\n\\nThere\\'s a slight problem however, I was really out of shape.\\n\\nI am at the beginning of the staircase up the mountain and my mom (bless her heart) offered to take my wallet and the hotel keys so it wouldn\\'t weigh me down. Left me with just my phone. She decided she didn\\'t want to join me on my hike up the mountain because (understandably) she was worn out.\\n\\nI begin my ascent, around 15-30 excruciatingly painful minutes later, i make it to the top. I had a sense of pride as I stepped to the entrance of the gate. I would be able to see a part of Greece that the rest of my tour bus wasn\\'t able to see. I would have stories to tell at the dinner table. I would have amazing pictures.\\n\\nSuddenly, right at the door I see a sign.\\n\\n\"8 Euros for admission\" \\n\\nand with that, I took my walk of defeat back down the 999 steps. \\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\nI left my wallet and climbed a mountain to see a historical site, only for there to be an admission fee. \\n\\n As one might think on Valentine’s Day in particular, people like to get up to some frisky business, myself included. After indulging in some post-dinner beer and chocolate ice cream, my boyfriend and I (F) decided to have an “oral sex party”.  We felt creative and made up a card game that allowed us to test the luck of the draw. ~Card game rules at the bottom~\\nEach number card drawn would result in that amount of minutes of oral play performed on the partner, and if a face card was drawn, additional special features could be implemented during that turn, such as toys or fingers. Each turn consisted of drawing a card and pleasuring the other orally until the timer was up. Then switch and repeat until we couldn’t take it anymore and would inevitably fuck. Pretty straight forward.\\n\\nA few turns in, I had only drawn low numbers and was itching to give him longer blowjobs as he was drawing high cards and face cards. I had just drawn a 4 which followed his 8 minute King turn, so I was incredibly turned on and really just wanted to pleasure him as he deserved. I was having the time of my life, and he clearly was too, so I went off script and ignored the 4 minute timer. I kept going deeper and deeper until I was feeling him down my throat. Turned on by my own accomplishments of getting him that far back, I kept deepthroating him and when he told me he was going to cum, in my own enthusiastic dick swallowing vigor, I accidentally jammed him back to the feeling I knew there was no return from. A volcanic surge immediately erupted and I tried my darndest to swallow it back but there was just too much. I pulled back and tried, to catch it in my hands but was unsuccessful and left staring at a brown mess of the ice cream and cum on my white sheets.\\n\\nLuckily my boyfriend is the sweetest ever and after a quick pic\\\\*, cleanup, and laundry cycle, we cuddled and enjoyed the rest of the night together.\\n\\n\\\\--&gt;After it happened I realized I could reap the sweet karma benefits of my misfortune and decided it was best to gather photo proof of such event. Also was drunk and thought it was a good/funny memory to capture. Albeit disgusting...\\n\\nBecause y\\'all nasty asses wanted to see the [aftermath](https://imgur.com/a/ggWdsSr). It looks like shit so don\\'t say I didn\\'t warn you.\\n\\n\\nI guess it\\'s inevitable with stories like these that end up blowing up to assume it\\'s made up. Here is the [text](https://imgur.com/a/nqMulPq) I sent my bf asking for his approval to post because it doesn\\'t just involve me, so I wanted to make sure he was comfortable with my sharing first. 3 years together and we continue to work on our communication and keeping each other in the loop. \\n\\nCARD GAME RULES-\\nShuffle the desk of cards, either use half or full deck. However you\\'re feeling in the moment. Each player draws a card to flip over simultaneously. Highest card is the giver in the first turn.\\n\\nAlternate drawing cards and going down on each other for the number of minutes you draw on your card. If you draw a face card, these were the special rules. To be changed as is fit for your relationship. Ours were as follows-\\n\\nJack was either only hands or only mouth for that turn. Queen was the option to add a toy-vibrator for me, plug for him. King was the classic pinky in ass, other fingers in my pussy. Or for him, my finger in his ass, a recent addition to our sexual escapades which I love. Ace was getting to fuck, then going back to oral after that turn.\\n\\nEach face card that was drawn was followed by the drawing of a number to figure out how long that would last.\\n\\nOur rule was no cumming during the game so we could edge as long as possible before the inevitable fuck. That didn\\'t end up happening past a few rounds...clearly.\\n\\nThank you for gold x4, kind strangers! Platinum too! And silver x4! I know many didn\\'t think this was worthy of the gildings, so many thanks. Will be passing on the wealth in honor of this blunder.\\n\\nTL;DR Sexy times were interrupted when I was giving my bf an enthusiastic bj and vomited chocolate ice cream all over his dick as he was orgasming. I’m in the Navy, and about 4 years ago I was stationed in Cuba. I had a new girlfriend that I was trying to impress by cooking her dinner (even though I was a horrible cook).\\n\\nI decided I was going to make some jalapeño poppers as a side dish, and foolishly decided to use my finger to scoop out the seeds before stuffing them with sour cream.\\n\\nOnce everything was prepared I popped them into the oven and decided to take a shower while I waited.\\n\\nNaturally, being a guy I decided to have a wank in the shower. No harm no foul right? \\n\\nWRONG.\\n\\nI felt the burn with every stroke, but I was so close to finishing I just...decided to bust a nut... and then I would figure out what to do next. (Yes, I know this is my own fault, I’m not proud of it okay?)\\n\\nUnfortunately that 10 minutes of wanking only further cemented the juices from the jalapeños deeper into the skin of my penis. (Shocking I know).\\n\\nThe pain soon became unbearable, I was rushing around my barracks room butt naked desperately trying anything I could think of to alleviate the pain: washing my member off with a clean towel, putting ice cubes between my penis and my ballsack, standing in front of the fan, nothing was working. \\n\\nThen it dawned on me. I recalled hearing that milk can help alleviate the burn in someone’s mouth after eating spicy food.. and I knew this was my only hope.\\n\\nI filled up a glass with ice cold milk, set it on the floor, and squatted down on top of it, dunking my bits into the heavenly, cooling liquid.\\n\\nInstant relief. Thank God, I said to myself. There was only one problem, the moment I took my penis back out of the milk, the pain rushed back to my lions.\\n\\nSo I sat there, in a squatting position, my dick afloat in a glass of milk, and realized my blinds were wide open, on a sunny afternoon. Anyone could look in and see what was happening. But the pain was so bad that I couldn’t keep my dick out of the milk for more than a second or two.\\n\\nI decided that the only solution was to lay on the ground, face down ass up, so that if I was to flash someone at least they would only see my ass cheeks and not my burning schlong.\\n\\nI laid there for about 2 hours until my girlfriend came back from work, and found me in my miserable state. \\n\\nAfter a lot of laughter and about 10 minutes of explaining the situation, she asked me “why didn’t you just press the glass of milk into your body with one hand, so you could walk around and put some clothes on and stuff?\\n\\nNeedless to say, if I didn’t feel like an idiot before, I did then. \\n\\nEventually a few hours later I went to the emergency room, where I was given a cream that barely worked, and I was excused from work the next day.\\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\nMade jalapeño poppers, wanked in the shower, willy burned with the fury of a thousand sons, dipped it into a glass of milk while lying naked on the floor, girlfriend walked in. \\nWe are no longer dating, but I hope her thinking back on my embarrassing story puts a smile on her face now and then.\\n\\nEDIT: sincere thank you to everyone who explained to me how TL;DR works!! And thank you for the gold and silver!!! Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/co5hbl/tifu_update_asking_about_my_parents_divorce_and/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share\\n\\nOkay, first off, my parents have been divorced for 12+ years. I am 21 now and was 7 or 8 when they split. I found out a few years ago it was because my mom was cheating on my Dad with my nurse from the NICU from 1997 (oof).\\n\\nCasually talking to my mom (who has since remarried for the THIRD time) I asked about their divorce out of curiosity. She went into a few details and brought up a car ride with my Dad. She wouldnt elaborate so I called my Dad (BIG MISTAKE)\\n\\nMind you, Dad took me and my sister in when my mom left and raised us. It kind of went like this:\\n\\nMe: \"So I was talking to mom about your divorce and she brought up a ride in the car with you that initiated the divorce\"\\n\\nDad: *hesitantly* \" Yeah, you, me and your sister were in the car when I came back from overseas and we were talking about what you guys wanted to be when you grew up. Your sister said something and you said \"I want to be a nurse like, [insert his name here]\". I pulled over to the side of the road and you spilled the beans\"\\n\\nApparently, at 7 or 8, I informed my dad about a guy staying in OUR house in HIS room sleeping in THEIR bed while he was gone for months for military stuff. I told him EVERYTHING. How mom told us he was an \"old friend\" who needed \"help\" and who would be staying with us \"to protect us while Daddy is gone\". How he watched us for a week while mom disappeared, took us to movies, dinner, etc. There was a point of him asking if I would move to California with him and my mom (they got married 2 weeks after my parents divorce was finalized and moved to California)\\n\\nI never remembered this occurence. He said he went home, pulled phone records, emails and even the chat messenger history (this is like 2004 or 2005 idk).\\n\\nI\\'m not blaming myself, but, damn. Little me saved my Dad\\'s ass from being used any longer by her.\\n\\nNote to self: dont ask too many questions.\\nInsert big \"WHAT THE FUCK\" here\\n\\nTL;DR. TIFU by asking too many questions about my parents divorce and found out I\\'m the one who dimed my mom out for infidelity.\\n\\nEdit: This is a fuck up because I was apparently never supposed to know - hence my mom not wanting to talk about it and my dad being hesitant on telling me.\\n\\nEdit 2: Super fuck up. I\\'m learning more and more about their marriage I never needed to know from other family. I was the \"save the marriage\" baby\\n\\nEdit 3: Wow. I didnt realise how many other people have gone through finding out this kind of stuff later in life. Kudos to all of you for learning from the example!\\n\\nEdit 4: Holy shit! I\\'ve learned a lot from all of you! This blew up and I\\'ve made a few decisions:\\n-I am never getting married\\n-I think it\\'s time to cut off my mom\\n-Dont ask questions about your parents failed marriage - \\n\\nEdit 5: Apparently, after the divorce, she wrote my grandmother a letter stating she didnt want to take care of children and wanted to \"live her life\"\\n\\nAlso, I didnt remember this occurence because I guess it didnt really stick out to me. My dad said he acted calm and acknowledged everything, like a normal convo. The events after I remember oh so vividly.\\n\\nMoral of this story: Dont think your kids wont talk if you\\'re cheating and do not BRING them around your kids. Actually, just dont cheat 🤦\\u200d♀️ easier said than done but damn!\\n\\nAlso, please note, I didnt have to throw any paper for my mom to be a ho!\\n\\nFinal Edit: Thanks to everyone for sharing their stories similar to mine and acknowledging that, for the children, the divorce was never their fault! These conversations have really got me thinking about how toxic for me it is to talk to my mom. I\\'ll update in a bit. Thanks guys and keep your head up if you fuck up! Checking my email is the last normal thing I remember before waking up in the hospital, except for a few scary-as-fuck bits here and there. Hence, this comes from my own direct recollection, with the gaps filled in by my wife and other witnesses.\\n\\nI had a full tonic-clonic seizure, right at my desk. Details are mostly irrelevant, here, but I\\'ve never had a seizure before. (And initial assessment is that it was probably a \"perfect storm\" situation with a new prescription I was on that will (hopefully) never happen again.)\\n\\nMy wife was in the next room and of course called 911, and the ambulance showed up. Problem is, I was [postictal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postictal_state?oldformat=true), which is a post-seizure state where you\\'re essentially not in your right mind. But when two big dudes came into my house unannounced and in a big hurry to move towards me, I went into home-defense mode. The fact that they were clearly in EMT uniforms and there to help me was lost in the scrambled mess my brain was in, but my more basic instincts were working fine. I don\\'t think I actually assaulted the EMTs, as they just kept their distance and radioed for police backup when I started yelling at them telling them (apparently) \"GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY HOUSE. I DON\\'T WANNA FIGHT YOU.\"\\n\\nAnd so the police sent one guy.\\n\\nNow I remember feeling extremely protective of my wife and convinced that this home invasion was serious business now that this 3rd guy was coming towards me and attempting to physically restrain me. I don\\'t remember, but I\\'d bet you dollars to donuts that the millisecond he rolled his shoulders forward and widened his stance is the second that I went from uncooperative to full apeshit; it\\'s just what you do when you\\'re trained to fight and there doesn\\'t seem to be another option, as when you are protecting your family like I thought I was about to have to do.\\n\\nThat\\'s when things started getting ugly. I was an amateur MMA fighter about fifteen years ago with a local dojo, and while I haven\\'t practiced for a long time, I can tell you those instincts never fully leave you. I know how to reverse any submission hold a local cop is likely to be able to proficiently attempt on me, apparently even whilst postictal. Before backup arrived, I had swept the leg of the officer and had him in an armbar. Thank fuck I didn\\'t go for a blood choke whilst my brain was short-circuiting. I was also screaming (roaring, apparently) at my wife to call the police. The irony of my request was lost on me at the time. That primal roar was the scariest sound she\\'s ever heard come out of my body, so she tells me, and I didn\\'t stop roaring. Luckily (for him and me), cop #1 didn\\'t put up any further resistance until his backup arrived.\\n\\nFive more big dudes showed up (now 6 cops + 2 EMTs + my wife). No weapons drawn, no tasers. Fortunately they knew they were walking into a medical call, and boy they should get a medal for how well they handled it.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t going down without a fight, and 1v1 was no contest even though they were way above my weight class. But with sheer overwhelming force they pretty much wore me out and then dogpiled me to the ground, cuffed me in the back, and then stood me up to walk me to the ambulance. Big mistake. I easily spun my way out of the officer\\'s control grip (hand on handcuff chain, other hand on my shoulder), and gave him a front kick to the breadbasket he probably won\\'t forget anytime soon. \"Bring it, fuckers,\" I remember thinking (or saying? who knows). I also remember being this weird mix of scared, emboldened by my recent \"escape\", and pissed *right* the fuck off, all at the same time.\\n\\nStill cuffed, front kicks were the new order of the day. I was like the goddamn free sample guy at the supermarket, giving them out to anyone who came near me. Details are loose on what happened next, but I guess they did some kind of brute force team tackle again and got me to the ground, and from the cuts on my wrists, they may have used some kind of pain compliance technique with the cuffs. It didn\\'t work, as I was able to shrimp my way out from underneath the guy(s) on top of me and throw a nasty double heel kick from lying down. Fortunately it just grazed the guy on the shoulder rather than the neck/head, which is where I would certainly have been aiming.\\n\\nNext thing I remember vividly is being face down on my living room carpet barely able to breathe (thanks to being out of shape these days, with at least one big guy on my back), and thinking this was the end for me, then they\\'d rape my wife, and let my cat out in the cold winter night.\\n\\nThey weren\\'t screwing around at this point. Apparently judging it worth the risk, while I was pinned the EMTs shot me in the ass with some kind of chemical restraint, and the cops just sort of sat on me and let my wife try to calm me down until it had taken full effect and I was strapped to the gurney in soft restraints.\\n\\nWhen I woke up (over a full day later--combination of insomnia + seizure + downers + 1v6 cage match really wore me out, I guess), I was bruised to shit, but aside from some minor cuts on my wrists from the cuffs and a nasty hole in my bottom lip from me biting it during the seizure, I\\'m a lot better off than I could have been. I have some nasty pins and needles in my hands so those cuffs must have been torqued fairly hard (by me or the cops, who knows), but I\\'m told by my attending doctor that should go away in about six months(!).\\n\\nWhen got home I called the police to apologize and thank them for getting my combative ass to the ambulance. Thanks to them for being incredibly good sports about the whole thing. (And not pressing charges, especially given my level of...enthusiasm.)\\n\\nI\\'m still trying to wrap my head around just how badly this *could* have gone. Yeesh. The unpredictable seizure alone is bad enough without nearly suiciding-by-cop had there been a weapon within reach. Scares the bejesus out of me just knowing how absolutely out of control I was.\\n\\ntl;dr: I learned exactly how many big dudes with at least basic hand-to-hand training it takes to drag me from my home against my will. (Six, plus a syringe of something in the ass.)\\n\\nEDIT: Well, this was a much bigger response than I expected. Thanks for all of your comments (especially those from police and medical professionals and other patients that have gone through something similar). And, wow, thanks for the gold, kind strangers.\\n\\nCommon question was where this happened: As a few of you figured out (stalkers! LOL), yes, I\\'m in Canada, and yes it was bloody cold out at the time, even by Canadian standards. (reposted at the appropriate time with some adjustments!)\\n\\nThis happened about 3 days ago, i’m finally able to move and get out of bed.\\n\\nSo I am generously endowed, and have a very good relationship with my dick. Lol. I occasionally post images on reddit and other places, and someone asked me if i could perform auto-fellatio. I hadn’t ever thought of it, so I read some tips, watched some videos and realized that because of my size and my general skinny frame, i have the ideal body type for sucking my own D. How exciting lol.\\nSo, there are a few different approaches, leaning forward or legs over your head. I tried the leaning forward approach but had no luck at all, so then i was like fuck it, got naked, layed down near a wall, threw my legs over my head, and slowly “walked down the wall” as the advice was. Holy shit i was close. Let me also say i was very aroused at the moment, and this was a few days of arousal, so my cock was extra hard and the head was pulsating. As the head flexed and i did, i got my tongue on the tip of my dick basically on the first try. WOW. I was excited and turned on, and hard as fuck.\\n\\nSo, i started stroking and pulling my cock closer to my mouth and it started getting even harder and now i can basically put my lips on the head. it felt insane and i was so happy. as i was stroking, my lips were able to almost fully cover the head, and i started to suckle. it didn’t take much. the whole situation caused a deep orgasm. the shaking kind.\\n\\nsidebar- yes i came in my mouth. for reference i am totally straight and have never had a dick in my mouth. okay back to the story...\\n\\nso i’m shaking, feet over my head, dick in my mouth, and the final release pushed my body into a further position, and there it was. not really sure what popped, but i collapsed onto my side and literally couldn’t move. cum dripping out of my mouth, laying on my side, naked, in the bathroom.\\nluckily feeling came back soon and but i couldnt stand up. crawled to bed... had a friend bring me some muscle relaxers, said i tweaked it “cleaning under the counters” lol. still in bed, but can actually walk today for the first day. \\n\\nluckily i don’t need to explain this to a doctor.\\n\\ntl:dr - sucked my own d, came in my mouth, threw out my back.\\n\\nedit:  thank you for all of the advice (and the offers, lol).  i will not fuck around with this any more.\\n\\nedit 2: i spit, but not totally intentionally.  it was that moment that all went to hell.  not sure what i would have done if i was thinking about it.\\n\\nedit 3:  c\\'mon guys, sucking your own dick is as gay as jerking off or playing with your ass.  get over it. if you\\'re that afraid of you\\'re own body, that\\'s weird, and super homophobic\\n\\nedit 4: \"i\\'ve heard it feels more like sucking dick than getting your dick sucked\" - i\\'ve never sucked a dick, so i can\\'t tell you, and yes, it didn\\'t feel like getting head from another person.  but it was very pleasurable and felt better than my good ol\\' hand.\\n\\n Happened two weeks ago.\\n\\nSo a few weeks ago my (29M) wife (28F) got into an accident and broke both her hands. She will have a full recovery, but for three months her hands need to be in these giant casts that make her look like she has clubs at the end of her arms. Obviously she can\\'t use her fingers for the next few months so I have been doing every: cooking, cleaning, changing her clothes, bathing her, brushing her teeth, and yes wiping her butt after she goes number two.\\n\\nBefore the FU I would go to the kitchen while she uses the bathroom and come back to wipe her when she finishes and calls me over. However, during this one certain time the FU happened. I go to leave the bathroom after pulling her pants down and sitting her onto the toilet, but out of pure absent minded dumbassery I must\\'ve turned the lock on the door before leaving. I close the door without thinking much of it and go wait in the kitchen so my wife can have her privacy as she does her business. Soon enough I hear her say she\\'s done and calls me over. I walk to the bathroom door and. it\\'s. locked.\\n\\nPanic. From both me and her. The door is too far for her to reach, and she wouldn\\'t be able to unlock the door with her club hands anyway. I lost the key to the bathroom door a long time ago so there\\'s that. I ask my wife if I should run and bust the door down, to which she says no and I doubt I\\'ll be able to anyways (pretty hefty door). So there we are separated by a locked bathroom door and shit drying on her butt. As I was about to give up and call the fire department, I hear the door knob rattle and click. I turn the knob and to my surprise it opens! I ask my wife how she was able to unlock the door but I see for myself. She\\'s managed to pick up the toilet scrubber between her two giant stumpy casts and must\\'ve used the bristles to unlock the door.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t touch anything and just clean me up\", she says. And that\\'s when I realize the bathroom side of the door, and everything else the scrubber touched has to be covered in a nice layer of nasty toilety goodness. Let\\'s be honest, how coordinated can you be with two casts instead of your fingers? That must have took her many clumsy tries and as a result touched every surface of the bathroom with the gross scrubber. And so after wiping her, cleaning her up, and pulling up her pants I tell her to go to the kitchen and I\\'ll clean up the bathroom.\\n\\nI spend the next 40 minutes thoroughly bleaching, scrubbing, and shining the bathroom and trying not to think that all this could\\'ve been avoided if I didn\\'t lock the door. Now, to avoid that situation happening again I sit next to my wife while she uses the bathroom. She now shits holding my hand and while she squeezes I rub her back encouragingly (probably tmi but oh well).\\n\\ntl;dr Couldn\\'t go wipe wifey\\'s shit covered butthole after she used the bathroom because I accidentally locked the door. Resulted in me having to clean out a toilet scrubber\\'ed bathroom for 40 minutes.\\n\\nnote: no a bidet won\\'t help. we got one a couple years ago out of curiosity but we both hated the feel of it (we aren\\'t against butt stuff as we rim each other quite often but water shooting up the feces covered backside is no bueno). Also, even if we did use a bidet she wouldn\\'t be able to turn the knobs anyways. I don\\'t mind doing all the chores, I love her too much to care, and wiping her butt has really brought us closer. I think it\\'s an overall win, but subtract the part where I locked the door.\\n\\nedit: holy shit this blew up. also, thanks for the gold! so many of you recommended a bidet, but didnt read that we hate bidets. thank you for your concern but for the two us, wiping is still better than bidet even considering our situation. Second, many people came at me for not being able to unlock a door/not sure how the lock works. The locking switch is on the bathroom side of the door, and i can lock it without the door being closed (locking the door simply restricts the handle from moving, so i can close the door after locking it and the door would be stuck shut until unlocked from the inside). our keyhole is very small, so i dont think a screw driver would fit, and i dont know  what the credit card method is but i doubt thatll work with our lock. i tried using a bobbypin and paper clip to no avail. third, we have a heavy oak door so im positive it would be impossible to knock it down. lastly, many of you who confused as to how we hold hands, with her hands being in club form. holding hands right now is rly just me holding her clubs, but its the thought that counts.\\n\\nedit 2: some of you are wondering what the accident was. she was riding her bike (down hill mountain biking) and the front wheel snagged on something and stopped spinning. her and the bike flew forward and her hands slammed into a rock wall and got crushed between the rock and her body/bike. also, rimming is only after shower times! and water up butt is fine if ur in the shower, but it feels out of place if the rest of ur body is dry and ur butt is wet. like wearing shoes while the rest of ur body is naked.\\n\\nedit 3: pls read the edits!\\n\\nedit 4: okay so based on the sheer volume of pro-bidet ppl with good reviews, my wife and I have discussed the possibility of getting another bidet. apparently u can get ones that dont blast you with ice cold water? interesting.\\n\\nedit 5: i didnt know /r/tifu uses bidets so religiously\\n\\nedit 6: many of you were confused with the use of the word squeeze. to clarify, squeeze doesn\\'t mean her squeezing my hand, as it would be impossible considering she has club hands. squeeze means her squeezing out a poo.\\n\\nedit 7: yes we clean our toilet brush! no there isn\\'t anything visible that gets smeared, but nobody likes the idea of something that\\'s been in the toilet to be touching everything. So there I was driving down the interstate going about 70 mph minding my own business. I feel a small tickle on the back of my neck barely above threshold. I reach back to itch the feeling and bring my hand back to the wheel. IT’S A GIANT FUCKING SPIDER! \\n\\n\\n\\nWorse still, that monster took a short ride on my hand and landed in my lap. I quickly slap the crap out of this thing. Well, I am not a smart man. That spider got squashed into liquified guts with my nuts on the other end. I’m not sure if anyone has ever had their nuts thunderclaped while driving but it’s not conducive to maintaining your lane. The shock and vomit inducing pain cause me to jerk the wheel and at the speed I was going I proceed to do terrifying back and forth where I nearly flip my SUV. Naturally, a cop saw the whole thing and the blue lights go up.\\n\\n\\nSo I keep my hands on wheel and the cop comes up to the window. “Son, what seems to be your problem!?” The cop had been directly behind me and I assume he nearly rear ended me. For whatever reason he wasn’t happy. “Officer, I’m not sure if you’re going to believe me but take a look at my crotch real quick” ... awkward pause... “that didn’t come out very well but that mess is what’s left of the spider I powersmashed on my balls.” I leave it at that and let him connect the dots. He leans over a little to look at the spider guts. After checking to see if I had any warrants he lets me go.\\n\\n\\n\\ntl;dr: I powersmash a spider on my balls while driving, nearly crash, got pulled over. I am cringing while writing this. I was going to a library to study (I’m in college, yay ) and I saw this cute guy as I’m walking in. I was thinking “hot damn, he fine” but I didn’t think he saw me so I sat down at a table that was empty. It’s early morning on a Friday, so no one was there. I was in a rush to leave dorms, so my bra was not fitting right at all-TMI but basically only 40% of my left boob was actually in the bra.\\n\\nSince the library room I was in was basically empty I had the bright idea to, with both hands, grab my bra (through my shirt, don’t worry)and hitch it up. I can’t exaggerate this enough-this was not a sly fixing of the strap, or a gentle adjusting of a side boob: I was fondling myself. \\n\\nLiterally as I am grabbing my breasts, the cute boy, who was still deciding where to sit, chose to walk back in my direction and saw the whole thing, which I only realized when I looked up.\\n\\nThen he chose to sit next to me? I don’t know why? Do boys find girls who viciously yank at their bras in libraries on Friday mornings attractive? But I was so embarrassed at this point, and my face was hot, so I didn’t even look at him. He kept sneaking glances at me, and I have NO IDEA what he was thinking. That I was psycho? That he had to sit in that seat because it was too late to turn back? I don’t know. \\n\\nAnyway, to add to this, my stomach kept rumbling in the quiet library. It’s at that point that I decided I had to get out of there, and of course I tripped as I tried to stand. Anyway. That’s me. This is my life. Thoughts? Comments? Help? \\n\\nTLDR: a cute boy in a library saw me trying to stuff my boobs back into my bra. \\n\\n I’m in my second trimester of pregnancy and with that comes a much more... robust libido.\\n\\nToday my husband went back to work and I found myself missing him, badly. I, in my hormone induced horniness, decided that I absolutely could not wait the 4 hours until he got home and went upstairs to find something to help me out.\\n\\nI am happy and healthily married. We have a good sex life. So it was unsurprising but also disappointing to me to open our “dirty drawer” and find that my favorite vibrator had some dust (and grossly, an errant strand of pet hair) stuck to it.\\n\\nBut, I was determined... and lazy. I didn’t just climb two flights of stairs preggo to have to go down and spend the 15 minutes cleaning my toy. And then, I saw it. A box of condoms that had been untouched for 8 months. Bingo!\\n\\nHappily and ignorantly I unwrapped one, put it on the vibrator and went to town figuring I’d clean it all up once I was done and that I was providing myself a safe and sanitary experience in the interim.\\n\\nAnd then the burning started.\\n\\nMy hormonally foggy, pregnant lady-boner brain forgot the whole reason why we stopped using the condoms in the first place (which led to our accidental but no less welcome baby bump): I had developed a nasty latex allergy that resulted in hives and a rash.\\n\\nSure as shit, I had just gleefully and stupidly rubbed an irritant ALL OVER my already super sensitive lady bits. Not only that but I was so embarrassed because I knew I’d have to explain to my very sweet, very loving husband why I felt the need to scratch at my crotch incessantly when he got home. So, I cried. Because I cry about everything these days.\\n\\nSo now I have diaper cream that I bought for the baby on MY cooch and my husband has laughed at me over the phone and already tried coming up with several nicknames for my itchy, rashy private parts like any good humored husband would.\\n\\nTL;DR : Got horny from pregnancy hormones, decided to take care of it myself but was too lazy to clean my vibrator; put a condom on it thinking it would solve the problem but forgot/ignored that I was allergic to latex. Now I have diaper rash cream on my cooch and my husband is laughing at me.\\n\\n\\nEDIT: thank you for all the nicknames for my vagina. I showed this to my husband and he laughed so hard he cried so the humiliation is worth it to see him have a little joy at my expense. I hope he doesn’t refer to my genitalia as “Scratchalotapus” for forever but I get what I deserve.\\n\\nMany comments saying “why the fuck do you still have those?” Or “I hope they’re in the garbage now.” Yes. I have thrown the condoms away. They are in the trash. We will never buy latex condoms again. I promise.\\n\\n“Why would you use something you’re allergic to?!”: I think most people with skin allergies, or any allergy really, would agree that allergies are weird and can hit at any moment or build up over time. For a long time I WASNT ALLERGIC TO CONDOMS. And then using condoms resulted in discomfort which we guessed might have been an allergy but could have been ANYTHING: chafing, razor burn, my husband could have had something on his hands that caused a rash... we didn’t know, we only guessed. The important thing is that we now know for sure and we aren’t going to use them anymore. It’s also noted that many women commented some super useful information about communicating with the hospital when it’s time to deliver so I’m really grateful to all you ladies for the heads up on surgical tape, talking to our provider, and diaper rash cream for other uses. Thank you!\\n\\nPeople suggesting I abort my baby or hurt my husband or that I’m a whore for masturbating; people asking if they can “see my rash” or for more intimate details/photos: please, very kindly go fuck yourselves. I work in an office suite with a few other guys. We\\'re all in our mid fifties. I\\'m the only one that plays first person shooter games. And I often do so with my phone on the toilet. I keep the volume low to maintain stealth. \\n\\nOne day while seated on the throne I was happily waging battle but I couldn\\'t hear it. Little by little I turned the volume up but I still couldn\\'t hear it. I didn\\'t want to interrupt the game to diagnose so I played on in silence. After about ten minutes I finished up and went back to my office. \\n\\nWhen I got back I realized my phone was still paired with the speaker and the volume was all the way up. For about ten minutes the speaker had been blasting gunfire, explosions, and screaming, in my office. \\n\\nTL;DR: I serenaded my colleagues with battle sounds because I forgot to unpair my phone while I was in the bathroom playing a game on my phone. Obligatory, this happened this past Wednesday. \\n\\nSo I\\'ve been out of town the past few weeks, and my girlfriend kept talking about how she was working on a sexy role-play kind of outfit for when I got back. Well, color me stoked. I get home from my work trip, and alas, no surprise. No big deal, I figure it just didn\\'t pan out. So this is Sunday, fast forward to Wednesday. \\n\\nWednesday, I\\'m back at work.  Five o\\'clock rolls around, I go to my car, and I drive home. I walk in, and ooohh my god. The sexy surprise. My girlfriend in a maid lingerie costume (you know the type) waiting for me in our bedroom. FANTASTIC. We start going at it, maid costume comes off, she\\'s on top, and I go to kind of pin her arms against her back, and bend her over top of me. Well, I was a bit aggressive about it. \\n\\nI proceed to body slam her onto myself, with her shoulder coming down into my mouth with a force AT LEAST equitable to the new naval rail gun. She asks if I\\'m alright, it\\'s then I realize, no, no, I\\'m not alright. I taste iron in my mouth, and realize that, sure enough, she\\'s dislodged one of my teeth. It\\'s literally lying parallel in my mouth.  Not to be outdone, I tell her sure, I\\'m fine, rip the tooth back into place (or as close as possible), and try to keep going. She doesn\\'t say anything at first, then she informs me that apparently I\\'ve got blood all over my mouth. She was not really into that, apparently. \\n\\nI don\\'t have dental insurance, so I go to the ER, and regale the staff there with my sexual misadventure. Missed work the next day, while arguing with insurance and going to the dentist. It\\'s been quite the surprise.\\n\\ntl/dr: Girlfriend\\'s sexual surprise ends with me losing a tooth and completely blue balled. \\n\\nEDIT: Showed this to my girlfriend, she wanted me to update to include that she took care of the blue ball situation when I got back from the hospital. 10/10. \\n\\nEDIT 2: Thanks for the Gold!  So, today I was on my way home from a doctors appointment with my pregnant fiancée. Since I’m not allowed to go into the doctor, and we didn’t plan on going anywhere else I decided to go commando since I didn’t have any clean underwear. Yeah... first mistake. So not even halfway home my fiancée starts complaining, and by complaining I mean COMPLAINING. Her pants were too tight, her legs hurt, she’s losing circulation because of her jeans, etc. So after about 30 minutes of this I get annoyed and decide fuck it, we aren’t stopping anywhere on the way back home, I’m giving her my shorts so I can have peace. I pull over, pull my shorts off and give them to her. It worked! She was content. So there I am, dick out, driving 80 mph down a 60 mph speed limit highway. Yeahhh, I think you know where this story is going. Wee-woo-wee-woo. \\n\\nI pulled over and proceeded to freak the fuck out. I was going 20 over and my dick is laying down on the seat. My fiancée couldn’t control her laughter, but I was fucking terrified. I’m not sure why, but the officer came over his speaker thingy and asked me to step out of the car. I think it was because it was dark and my windows are tinted. I’m not sure, but this was where my heart sank to my stomach. While I’m trying to figure out what the fuck to do I hear, \\n\\n“SIR, PLEASE STEP OUT OF THE VEHICLE.”\\n\\n“...uhh officer? I don’t have pan-“\\n\\n“SIR, STEP OUT OF THE VEHICLE.”\\n\\n“But I-“\\n\\n“SIR, DONT MAKE ME TELL YOU AGAIN.”\\n\\nAt this point I was getting irritated. Don’t ask me why I didn’t think of getting my shorts back from my fiancée, I don’t know why I didn’t. I was panicking. I poke my head out the window and look back,\\n\\n“Officer, pleas-“\\n\\n“STEP. OUT. OF. THE. VEHICLE.”\\n\\nthis is the point where I just go fuck it and throw my door open. I stand up and look at the officer with my dick out, \\n\\n“I was trying to tell you I was naked”\\n\\nThe officer just sort of looked at me for a minute then put his face in his hands. \\n\\n“Okay, get back inside the vehicle.” \\n\\nHe cautiously approached my vehicle and started asking questions. This story is already long enough so I won’t add everything he asked us, but we ended up getting a speeding ticket and a good ass chewing in the end. \\n\\nTLDR; went commando and gave pregnant fiancée my shorts on the way home to stop her complaining, I get pulled over and forced to step out of the car with my dick out.\\n\\nEdit: I’m confused as to why people are trying to disprove my story. Yes, a lot of things worked together for this unfortunate event to take place, but your sole argument is that this is “unlikely” to happen. That’s just ignorant because the fact that this is a strange occurrence is what makes it interesting. I won’t post a TIFU about me dropping my phone and picking it up, that happens to everyone. \\n\\nJust laugh and move on, no need to break out the fucking spectacle and fact check every word of a story posted for comedic purposes. And YES, THIS HAPPENED. Now stop typing shit. Husband just messaged me mid-flight with this story (his FU not mine, but shared with his permission):\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\"So I got up to put some deodorant on in the bathroom. The kind with the roller ball. I go to put it on and nothing is coming out. So I do a quick flick of it to get the liquid inside moving. Worst case scenario The roller bar goes flying off and liquid deodorant goes flying everywhere. Mirror, walls, floor... E v e r y w h e r e...\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEven worse... The deodorant is the exact color and consistency of semen. The bathroom looked like 10 guys had an orgy. My pants are also covered with this substance. I cleaned it up the best I could but I am horrified at what people will think if I missed a spot (I debated about telling the attendant but I am 99% sure I got everything. The worst part is I didn\\'t even get to use it.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR My husband tried to put deodorant while on his flight and instead made it look like he had a mile high sex party. Obligatory this didn\\'t happen today it happened about two months ago at a national  conference in my field that I was invited to speak at. The conference started out great, met lots of cool people, made some good connections, did my speaking that morning. Then lunch comes along. It was buffet style and the start of it has a bunch of different cheeses you choose from, about halfway down the buffet line I see what looks like another large plate of a single type of cheese. Thinking that the hotel  just has a hard on for giving people cheese options I take a few.\\n\\nI get back to my table and eat and talk with other conference goers and finally get to the last bit of cheese I took. I eat two sticks of it,  it\\'s weirdly soft and not at all like the other cheeses. One person gave me this odd look of concern. I eat a third stick of it and think this is way too soft to be cheese so wtf is it. Internal panic ensues when I realize it\\'s butter and I just ate a bunch of it in front of a table full of my peers.\\n\\nTL;DR - I thought sticks of butter were cheese and proceeded to eat them in front of my fellow conference goers.\\n\\nEdit: Apparently I\\'m an uncultured swine and didn\\'t know pats of butter was the correct term. Also, for the guy who offered me a \"blowie\" to make me feel better, I\\'m good thanks. Well, Reddit. It’s happened. My worst and most embarrassing fuck up was today. I’ve been seeing this new guy and we’re very new. It’s a few weeks in and we are still on our best behaviors in front of each other. He’s never even farted in front of me yet. He told me he’d pick up food after work and to meet him at his place. I go over and he’s bought a whole buffet of Mexican food. I didn’t have the heart to tell him I have a sensitive stomach towards Mexican food. I didn’t want him to feel like he wasted money so I bit the bullet and ate some food. An hour goes by and I’m thinking “hey, I’m feeling good! Maybe I’m in the clear!” I should have made my escape then. If only I knew what was about to happen. We were sitting on the couch watching a movie and I started to sweat. Like painful belly cramps and sweating so profusely I feel like I’m going to slide off the couch. I wait for the cramps to ease a tiny bit and I take off running to the bathroom. My guy is yelling down the hall asking if I’m okay. I can’t answer. I get to the bathroom and take the biggest shit of my life. I’m pretty sure it was wrapped around in the toilet looking like a real life poop emoji. I was feeling great relief until I realized I’ve now clogged the toilet. I’m now panicking and searching all over the bathroom for a plunger. No luck. I couldn’t face my guy and ask him for the plunger because that’s too embarrassing. So my logical mind thinks of the next best thing. My foot. Yes, my foot. I put my foot in the toilet bowl and try making the suction like a plunger would. To my relief, it worked. Now I have shitty water in between my toes. I wash my feet and then hands in the sink, walk back out like nothing crazy happened, gave him a kiss, and made a hasty retreat. So do I tell him about what happened or should I just keep it to myself... and all of Reddit?\\n\\nTL;DR: Ate bad food. Used my foot to unclog boyfriends toilet.\\n\\nThanks for all the awards! Who knew my poop story would get so much attention lol Sadly this is not my only crazy poop story 🤦🏻\\u200d♀️ This happened yesterday but I will be living with the emotional scar for the rest of my life, and the physical scar for a few more days.\\n\\nAs a late but generous birthday gift, I bought my girlfriend her first dildo - a whopping eight incher. It arrived earlier in the day, before the time for appropriate shenanigans, so as soon as we opened it, we decided to proceed with some more SFW fun. \\n\\nWe aren\\'t peasants so we got a *suction* dildo, so of course we did what any aristocrat would do and stuck it on any available surface. This started harmlessly with the furniture, the walls, and whatever other random objects were around. Soon enough, we got bored of that, and started exploring more... exotic places. Namely my forehead. With a good *thwack*, I stuck it loud and proud as a glorious silicone unicorn horn, and took some fun pictures for posterity. \\n\\nAfter a few minutes of good wholehearted laughter and enough dicking around, it was time to move on. What I failed to realize was that I might have stuck it a little *too* hard to my forehead, and it didn\\'t come off with a quick tug. A few pulls later and my second penis was still gripped to my face. After enough work to make a plumber proud, I managed to yank it off. Some more laughs and we were done. \\n\\nLater, after my gf got a good look at my face, she paused and told me to look in a mirror. I came face to face with the consequences of my actions, the plunging of my forehead. The incredible suction paired with many tugs at the skin left a sizeable bruise on my forehead, about the size of two quarters. I\\'ve spent today hiding away from my roommate, and leaving my hair down.\\n\\nI can never go outside again, lest my shame consume me.\\n\\nTL;DR Stuck a dildo on my forehead and sucked my third eye open.\\n\\nEdit: \\n[The Unicorn](https://i.imgur.com/At1rbmh.jpg) in all its glory\\n\\n[The Aftermath](https://i.imgur.com/r1Nt8sX.jpg)\\n\\nEdit 2: I wish I was Tom Scott, but he has much nicer hair than I do. Red shirt is just a coincidence.\\n\\nOr is it? Not today as per usual. But 18 years ago.\\n\\nI had moved to California a few years earlier. A few blocks away was a grocery store. In that store was a toy section. Back then. 1998? It just had an assortment of coloring books and some \"squeaky\" toys. Rubber animals you would squeeze to make a noise. I would grab the \"squeak\" thing from those toys. They are the size of a pill or vitamin. If I placed it in my mouth and pulled it to the back I could talk while making a stupid noise. One time heading back to my friends after grabbing a fresh squeaker I accidentally chortle\\\\ snorted and inhaled the thing. I\\'m behind the store now ready to hop the stone wall back home. No one is around. Nor will there be til the trash is dropped at end of night. So I\\'m choking. But instead of a gasp its a loud squeak. Reeeeeet, ruuuuuh. I\\'m grasping at my chest. Reereet, ruuuh. My vision fades and a fall down on my back. This dislodges the squeaker with one more loud REET. After a moment on the ground I get up and go home. Deciding I\\'ll never take a squeaker again.\\n\\nEdit: Only to say thank you all for the laughs you provided me too. I was at my girlfriends parents house about to eat dinner, her mom had a big spread made up for build-your-own-tacos.\\n\\nNow at this dinner I was unbelievably baked out of my fucking mind. I mean I smoked a lot of damn weed with my roommate before leaving because my nerves were getting to me since this was my first time meeting her parents.\\n\\nSo fast forward a bit and we’re all making our plates, and I go last because I’m trying to be respectful.\\n\\nI make my plate with a few tacos and think no big deal, just gonna finish up here and go sit down with the others.\\n\\nNow when I sat down I noticed something was different about everyone. My girlfriend was trying to contain laughter while her parents had the most confused faces I’ve ever seen.\\n\\nTo try and break the ice I ask “what happened?” My girlfriend looks over at me and asks if I’m feeling okay whilst containing her laughter. Then she looks down at my plate to get me to see what I’d done.\\n\\nAnd my god you guys, the fucking embarrassment.\\n\\nI put Spanish rice full to the brim in my taco shells and I had the meat and other toppings scattered on the side in a mess on my plate. I was backwards in what I was trying to do but was too high to notice.\\n\\nI didn’t make a very good first impression because to this day they think I’m some kind of lunatic.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR I was so baked that I put my side on my taco and my taco on the side in front of my girlfriends parents while meeting them for the first time. My wife has started this incredibly annoying habit of walking around the house talking on speakerphone, like super loud and really annoying.\\n\\nOften, she\\'s having very personal conversations with her friends that no one else should really be hearing either.\\n\\nSo, I thought I would show her how annoying it was by calling my mom and talking to her on speaker while walking around the house.\\n\\nIt took me a second to figure out because I never use the speakerphone setting, but once I did I was glad to find out that my phone is WAY louder and WAY more obnoxious than my wife\\'s.\\n\\nThe whole plan completely backfired. \\n\\nInstead of being annoyed by the annoying use of loud speakerphone, my wife just joined in on the conversation and it ended up lasting the better part of 2 hours. \\n\\nSo now, it seems to have just normalized the behavior instead of stopping it.\\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\nTried to stop annoying bad phone habit, instead got stuck on a 2 hour call My partner and I pulled my car into the parking lot of the library. It was a hot summer day and we were there to use the WiFi and checkout a couple books and return a couple that were overdue. I\\'d been inside about ten minutes when some commotion started in the parking lot. My partner noticed and decided to go gawk at it while I finished up. \\n\\n\\nAnother five minutes go by and my partner hadn\\'t returned. I\\'d seen a few police cars go by. I decided to go see what all the fuss was about. Heading to the door I notice they\\'re all clustered near my car. \"Well this isn\\'t good.\" On closer examination I notice my partner approaching the group of officers. They\\'d just arrested some guy. Exiting I overheard the second half of the conversation. \\n\\n\\n\"... and then you entered that vehicle, the blue one?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes officer.\"\\n\\n\\n\"And took these items?\"\\n\\n\\n\"Yes officer.\" \\n\\n\\n\"And you entered these vehicles?\" The officer motioned to the row of cars, including mine. \\n\\n\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\\n\\nThere wasn\\'t much of value in my car. A few days prior we had picked up a few items at a garage sale for the new apartment for cheap. I wasn\\'t too concerned -- none of the windows in any of the cars appeared smashed or anything. Behind the officers a swarm of vehicles had boxed in another, a boring sedan. The door was ajar and inside I could see another officer setting items on the hood. It was a modest collection. None of my possessions appeared to be in the rather sizeable pile on the vehicle\\'s hood.\\n\\n\\nHe added nervously, \"Except that one.\" He motioned to my beat up Saturn. And I say beat up, but really it looked like something out of Mad Max. The hood and quarter panel were painted flat black, while the rest of the car was purple. It was coated in a veneer of rust all over the underside, looking like it had been ridden hard and put up wet. \\n\\n\\nMy partner raised her voice, \"Hey! Why not my car?!\" Well, I approached to correct her. I would regret this decision shortly. The officer gave a quizzical look at the would-be thief. \\n\\n\\n\"Yes, why not *that* car?\", the officer says, turning back to the thief. \\n\\n\\nAt this point, I\\'d reached the small crowd and announced myself. \"Excuse me, it\\'s actually my car.\" I got a polite nod, and the officers continued. I gave a questioning and slightly annoyed towards my partner. The thief, now appearing quite anxious, retorted \"Because of the dead body!\" \\n\\n\\nThere was a moment of silence as all the officers jerked up and all looked at him, then my car. Then me and my partner, all in rapid succession. They all reflexively put their hands on their sidearm and one of them looked at the two of us and said rather sharply \"Don\\'t move.\" Great. So now we\\'ve gone from petty theft to body stashing. An officer keyed up his radio to call for backup, \"suspicion of murder, suspects at gunpoint.\" Visions of officers opening the trunk to find some gruesome scene flashed through my head. My stomach braced. My partner and I exchanged nervous looks.\\n\\n\\nTwo other officers approached the car and peered into the back seat. At the same time then the guns came out of the holster and the two of them turned their attention to us, yelling, \"Get on the ground!\" Well this day is off to a great start. We\\'ve gone from overdue library books to murder. Me and my partner both complied, while other officers opened up my car. I heard some excited noises from them followed by silence, \"Uh chief, you better come see this.\" Both of them were grinning and looking back at the thief, who looked pale as a ghost. The plot sickens.\\n\\n\\nA third, rather larger man sauntered over and then burst out laughing, \"Let them up,\" gesturing towards the officer with his knee in my back. \"Okay, what the actual fuck is going on,\" I wondered to myself. The chief is practically out of breath from choking down laughter and tells his subordinate with the thief to go ahead and put him in the back of a squad car. We both approach nervously and peer into the car.\\n\\n\\nIt was only then I realized what had happened. The thief had been going through the cars and skipped ours because, in the back seat, was a pile of mannequin parts. We\\'d found them in an alleyway a couple days prior in the esteemed Loring Park area, perhaps the gayest part of the Twin Cities. I\\'d entirely forgotten about them. We had intended to use them to decorate our new, and rather empty, apartment, and nothing says queer quite like a fashion mannequin holding coats by the door. He must have spotted them and decided they were the chopped up remains of someone. \\n\\n\\nNow, we both knew they looked realistic enough because we\\'d managed to scare the shit out of a former roommate who liked to rummage through our stuff by leaving an arm and some pillows under a blanket to make her think one of us was sleeping there and discourage snooping. But of course, she\\'d gotten too curious and gotten a dose of karma for her trouble. And now all the officers were taking turns, looking back at us, and grinning ear to ear at us and the idiot thief. In the end, we were left with many apologies and another tale for friends of my fabled car of the damned. A few minutes later a SWAT truck, driven by some bored officers, pulled up and took their turn looking and laughing.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR - Was nearly given the chair for murdering a mannequin and overdue library books. \\n\\n\\nEDIT: Obviously officers don\\'t talk like this. It happened a decade ago. Forgive my attempt at recreating long forgotten conversation. Also, yes, it really was SWAT. No, I can\\'t explain it either.  So there is this girl who lives a state away from me, and she had been planning to come visit me for three months. The plan was for her to come over when I got off work at 930am. \\n\\nI had worked three overnights in a row and I didn’t have time to clean my apartment or get myself ready for her visit in the days prior due to being exhausted and/or at work.\\n\\nFlash forward to this morning. I get off work around 825 and have an hour to get home and get ready before she gets there. \\n\\nI made it home and had 30 mins to spare. I decided that at most I needed 5 mins to shower so I figured I had time to clean up a little bit. As I’m finishing cleaning, about to get in the shower, she texts me and says she will be 15-20 minutes late. (This is where the cascading failures begin).\\n\\n15-20 mins isn’t a lot of time, but I thought it was enough to get my downstairs trimmed up, just in case things got physical. \\n\\nAt first I tried to use an electric razor and it was going pretty well. It quickly turned to shit and cut my right nut twice in like 10 seconds. I decided that there is no way I could finish this without my manhood looking like a murder scene. \\n\\nI was panicking and had no idea what to do, seeing as she’d be there in less than 10 minutes and my undercarriage was in shambles. I went to put my razor away under the sink and noticed a box of self waxing strips that my friend had left behind when she was helping me wax my back. Perfect.\\n\\nI didn’t have time to read the directions, so I ripped to strips open and place them both into the middle of the jungle down there. I went to pull the first strip off and was greeted with extreme resistance and searing pain. Once again, I was too committed to not finishing and time was running out. I made the decision to rip the second strip off and just jump in the shower and hope that the encounter didn’t turn physical.\\n\\nAs soon as I go to wash the wax from my nether regions I realize that an enormous amount of extremely sticky wax is still all over my crack. I frantically try every soap I had in my shower to get it off. I even tried to use a coffee ground face mask (that was unpleasant).\\n\\nAt this point, somehow the wax sticky factor had quadrupled and I was 2 minutes away from her arrival. \\n\\nI said fuck it and dried off and got dressed. \\n\\nShe called me to say she was here and I got up to answer the door, when I realized that my boxers were stuck to my ass and that my ass cheeks were firmly stuck together. No time to figure it out now. \\n\\nWe chatted for a while and things ended up moving into a physical direction. She could tell that I was wincing in pain when I moved around and she kept asking what was wrong. I played it off as muscle cramps.\\n\\nThis worked fine until she went to take off my boxers and could feel the resistance of the wax glue from my cheeks and crack.\\n\\nShe immediately looked concerned and I had no choice but to tell her what had gone down moments before her arrival. It has been a long time since I’ve been that embarrassed. \\n \\nThe kicker is that once she stopped hysterically laughing at me, she pointed out that the wax kit comes with after wax removal wipes that I had failed to see during my frantic decision to wax in the first place.\\n\\n\\nTL,DR: I accidentally glued my ass cheeks together with a cheap self waxing kit, moments before a girl came over and I couldn’t get the wax off my ass before she got there.\\n\\nEdit: sorry y’all, I fell asleep after typing this. Didn’t know so many people needed closure. I was successful in the mission with “my rear flank exposed.” My ass cheeks got stuck to the sheets more than a few times and more than a few more hairs were removed that way, but all in all it went relatively well considering the circumstances.\\n\\nEdit 2: changed the infamous “his” to the proper pronoun. Sorry to ruin the conspiracy theories\\n\\nEdit 3: yes, for all of those interested, we had sex and I am seeing her again today. Also, I was talking to my best friend on Snapchat during the whole process and have a video of my reaction to the first strip being removed. I can post the link if anyone wants proof this happened\\n\\nEdit 4: the video. Per requests. https://imgur.com/gallery/ze5tOIw My son is 18 and we generally get along pretty well, though he\\'s going through his own life and I\\'m trying to respect that.\\n\\nSo I came home after work, him after school, I decided to visit his room to ask him what he wanted for dinner and to maybe play some Mario Kart.\\n\\nI\\'m still mortified at what I found...\\n\\nI walk in, fully clothed my son\\'s girlfriend is on all fours on the bed, my son\\'s face is buried into her butt... She stares at me with the widest eyes I\\'ve ever seen and within milliseconds releases what can only be described as the \"Horns of the apocalypse\" and farts directly into my son\\'s face. \\n\\nHe falls backward off the bed, brings down an entire table on top of him, she falls off the front of the bed flipped completely upside down, vertically. He yells \"dad!!\" when suddenly the contents of his entertainment center come crashing down on him.\\n\\nI rush to his aid, the room smells of some kind of mix of tunafish and hard boiled eggs. My son\\'s pants are down, he\\'s crying and I\\'m panicking trying to unbury him below the rubble. \\n\\nHis girlfriend then runs out of the room and heads for the bathroom, all I can hear are explosive noises that could break glass with soundwaves.\\n\\nMy son is bleeding, I haven\\'t said one word at this point. I muster the strength I have to get him to the car for an ER visit. I try to get his girlfriend but all I hear from the bathroom is a mix of crying and fart trumpets exploding.\\n\\nIn a moment of weakness I back up and just leave my house locking the door.\\n\\nMy son\\'s alright now, physically anyway. I\\'ll update if he gets pink eye. His girlfriend hasn\\'t contacted us so I can assume she\\'s still going to town. I\\'m no longer hungry so dinner\\'s out.\\n\\ntl;Dr walked in on my son burying his face into his girlfriend\\'s anus, she farts, he falls off bed and takes down a table and his entertainment center.\\n\\n**UPDATE**\\n\\nThanks so much for the gold! I originally just wanted to type this out as a literal \"TIFU\", as in I felt like I had really screwed up and wanted some support. I misunderstood the humor this subreddit is usually used for; I should have been more discreet with details to say the least. I never anticipated for a second this would grow to this level.\\n\\nMy son is fine, he just ended up with a few scrapes and bruises. I was mainly concerned at the site of blood added by the fact that all the objects falling down on him were pretty heavy game systems, figurine statues and the like.\\n\\nWe haven\\'t spoken much about the incident, but I did pry a few details out, in the least judgmental, kind way I could think to. \\n\\nThey had the house to themselves, it started with cuddling as she didn\\'t feel very well (obviously) and he admitted he just wanted to \"sniff\" her butt. She was probably reluctant to reveal HOW she didn\\'t feel very well. We *are* talking, but not much. He\\'s let out a few chuckles and smiles with red face. I realize walking in was a huge violation of privacy, but I am trying my very best to band-aid this. He is aware of the Reddit post but doesn\\'t mind.\\n\\nWhen we got home the bottom lock on the door was locked and she was nowhere in sight. She hasn\\'t contacted him at all since it happened, but in a few days or whenever she gets back to him I plan on driving him over to see her, and giving her the kindest smile and wave I can muster, all jokes suppressed. \\n\\nIf any of his gaming stuff is damaged I plan on fully replacing them, and getting him new stuff as an apology.\\n\\nA few answered questions:\\n\\n* I did not enter the room with my pants off. I was fully clothed, she was fully clothed, his pants were merely down. I originally typed out the TIFU in a hurry while we sat down.\\n\\n* I\\'m unsure what caused the massive explosion and upset stomach, but I suspect it was already brewing before I walked in, and she was trying to suppress it when she became a deer in headlights when I walked in.\\n\\n* I will knock before entering or maybe even call him the next time I get home! I realize now I invaded his privacy pretty heavily.\\n\\n* The room does still faintly smell, and Febreze just lingers in the air with the smell. I suspect she did more than fart on his face...\\n\\n* No pink eye luckily, either of us, yet\\n\\nI\\'ll update again if anything worth noting happens *tl;dr: I told my coworker his wife was too pretty for him and he pulled me aside and said that she was leaving him*\\n\\nIt is mostly men where I work, so naturally there is always some casual lighthearted roasting going on. Everybody does it and it is all in good fun. Builds morale so on and so on.\\n\\nOne of my coworkers, who was always an average looking guy, not ugly or unattractive, but until recently had a bit of a dad bod. His wife, however, was very pretty. I noticed this morning that he had lost some weight and I commented *\"you\\'re losing weight bro, looking good. Finally you\\'re looking good enough to deserve that pretty wife of yours\"* \\n\\nNow... it was meant to be a compliment. But he pulled me aside and told me that his wife was leaving him. One of her main reasons was that he apparently let himself go and she decided he wasn\\'t good enough for her.\\n\\nSo yeah, I felt pretty awful and I talked it over with him and we\\'re good now. I apologized but man do I feel like a complete asshole.\\n\\nI guess we never know what people are going through Obligatory *\"this happened a few months ago.\"*\\n\\nThis was easily the most stressful roller-coaster of an event that I hope I ever experience. \\n\\nThe scene is freshman year of college. I\\'m a wide-eyed innocent student having a great time away from his parents. I\\'ve made some good friends and enjoy messing with them. As such, I decide to pull a little prank on them. It starts with a simple idea: I\\'m going to Ohio on a business trip. I was actually going to lunch with my parents, but this was a more fun story. I hadn\\'t initially thought out this entire prank, but just like high school presentations, I decided to wing it. Every so often I would go on these out-of-state \"business\" trips, but I stayed vague as to what my business was. I told them that it was somewhat illegal, but in more of a gray area.\\n\\nMy friends were incredibly intrigued by my illicit endeavors, and as time went on, they began to ask more questions about this business. I still had little to no plan for this ordeal, but boy did I milk it. I had them convinced that there were overseas bank accounts with millions of dollars in them and that I had several people involved in this business. At one point I told them the story of how one of my employees got caught trespassing on government property and I had to pay $10,000 to bail him out. I would \"accidentally\" send a picture of several thousand dollars, claiming it was meant to go to someone else with no other explanation.\\n\\nThis went on for several months up until about April. The semester was coming to a close, and I had to figure out a finale for my little project. My roommates were in on my prank and several iterations of plans were discussed. The final version of this ~~bad idea~~ plan was as follows: I will create an email address posing as the chief of police at my college. In the email, the officer (we\\'ll call him Bill Myers) will inform my friends that he is currently looking to bring in ShortTail359 for questioning. I was very specific to say that no one should call 911 or contact anybody outside of this email address with the excuse that there was no official investigation so Bill was looking into the matter himself. I then went on to explain how ShortTail359 is conducting a business out of university housing and that this is all we know but the business might be illegal/dangerous. In summation: email me if you know of ShortTail359\\'s whereabouts, don\\'t call 911, don\\'t contact anyone else in the police department.\\n\\nI figured I covered my bases and sent the email. It was very well worded and quite convincing to a group of people who already believed I was running a secret business. Sure enough, my friends bought it hook line and sinker. One of them replied, informing Bill that she didn\\'t know anything about my business, other than that I mentioned it occasionally. Three friends ignored the email altogether, and one texted me saying she didn\\'t believe it.\\n\\nThe next three days were interesting. I had several classes with these people and finals were upon us so skipping class was not a good idea, but I had to make them believe I was on the run. Fortunately some of these classes had several hundred students and I was able to sit far away from our usual spots. The smaller classes I avoided altogether. Meals were eaten at odd times, and at one point I had to hide in the shower because a friend was in my dorm. I had no contact with the prank-ees outside the occasional text.\\n\\nFast forward to the Thursday I decided would be the day to reveal my shenanigans. I\\'m walking into class when these two men in suits stop me just inside the door. They ask me if I am ShortTail359 and upon confirming this they tell me they need to speak with me outside. We walk downstairs to the building\\'s lobby where I am greeted by two more men who have guns at their sides. All four of them hold up their badges in dramatic fashion and one introduces himself as \"Agent Michael Scarn with the FBI\" (fake name obviously). It was approximately at this point that I peed a little bit as I realized that I was in some trouble.\\n\\nAgent Scarn: \"Do you know why we\\'re here?\"\\n\\nShortTail359: \"No, but I have a pretty good guess.\"\\n\\nAgent Scarn: \"Well why don\\'t you tell us what your guess is?\"\\n\\nI proceeded to explain the email I sent out along with a brief summary of the genesis of my prank. 50 minutes of questioning later and I had given Agent Scarn the password to the email account, signed an agreement saying I won\\'t access the account or I\\'d face several charges, given a written statement of the events, crapped my pants twice, and completely missed my class. Agent Scarn gave me his business card and said they would be in touch.\\n\\nI go back to my dorm and try to come to terms with the fact that I may have ruined my future career and life altogether. All my friends had a good laugh at my expense but not before I had a good laugh at their expense for believing my stupid business story. After a long sleepless weekend I get a call from a Sergeant at the police station. He says that he needs to meet with me and we arrange a time. I go down to the station and for 10 minutes all he does is yell at me and tell me what a stupid idea this was. Now I\\'m a pretty good kid. Never got in trouble in school, honor roll, never so much as a speeding ticket, so having a police officer yell at me was a new experience. He finally calms down enough for me to explain that this is an anomale and that it was supposed to be an innocent prank. He believes me and tells me that regardless, they\\'re going to charge me with criminal impersonation which is a class A misdemeanor. My court date is set for a couple weeks from now and that was the end of it.\\n\\nI go to court fully prepared to leave with a no longer perfect record. As the staff is processing me and taking my mugshot, a lady asks me what my name is. I tell her ShortTail359, when a guy jumps around the corner and yells \"But you can just call him Chief Bill Myers!\" This was a much needed laugh and also informed me that word of my idiocy had gotten around town. I go into the court room and waited for this lighthearted judge to call my name. Most of the charges were speeding tickets or marijuana related so the judge was moving pretty quickly. However, he calls my name and then pauses. I walk up to the podium and he\\'s still paused, clearly reading over my file. He looks up at me, and then back down at my file again. After reading it completely through, he just starts laughing. Several minutes go by before he finally asks me if I have any sort of criminal history. I tell him I don\\'t have so much as a speeding ticket and he asks if I would like to keep it that way. I happily say yes and he give the DA my paperwork. The DA asks for my story and tells me that he\\'s never seen anything like this before (something I had heard several times at this point). He informs me that this is something they could have expunged as long as I pay my court fees. I thank him and go back to waiting for the judge to call me up again.\\n\\nWhen he does, a smile immediately dawns his face and he begins to chuckle. At this point I\\'m relieved enough to let out a giggle of my own since I can feel the entire court room wondering what I\\'ve done. The judge tells me that he will expunge my charge and asks me if I will ever do something like this again. I assure him that I will not and he says, with a smile on his face, \"You know son everyone in this court room is wondering who you impersonated, but I\\'m going to do something that you should have done and keep my mouth shut.\" I thank him and sheepishly walk out of the room.\\n\\nLater that day I took the required documents back to the court and had the whole charge expunged in a matter of hours. It was easily the most stressful month of my life and was not worth it at all, but I am now able to walk around with an FBI agent\\'s card in my wallet and keep a fond memory of being laughed at by a judge.\\n\\nTL;DR: I play a prank on my friends that ends with me being questioned by 4 FBI agents for almost an hour and charged with criminal impersonation.\\n\\nEdit: Here’s a link to Agent Scarn’s business card. It’s a little faded since it sits in my wallet. https://imgur.com/gallery/9hVW0Oa\\n\\nEdit 2: Spelling (EDIT 2)Proof:(https://i.imgur.com/Z0zm9xi.png)\\n\\nThrowaway, obviously. I also made the [same post](https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/af5eex/23andme_has_just_shown_that_ive_been_accidentally/) over at r/23andme.\\n\\nI just found out a few hours ago and my girlfriend and I are currently a mental wreck. \\n\\nQuick background\\n\\nMy girlfriend (I\\'ll refer to her as Sarah) and I have been dating for a little over than a year and our relationship has been going very well. We both happen to come from the same town and met each other in college after being introduced by a mutual friend of ours.\\n\\nHere\\'s where the FU begins to unravel\\n\\nLast year for Christmas, Sarah decided to come over and stay with me at my apartment for the holidays. I also had decided not to go home for the holidays either. Plus, all my other roommates were back home visiting family, so we had the whole place to ourselves. It was perfect. \\n\\nChristmas day rolls around, and Sarah had bought the both of us 23andme DNA kits. The thing is, is that we were both conceived by in-vitro fertilization via sperm donors. Both of our fathers were infertile so our parents had no choice. Deep down, the both of us were hoping to find our biological fathers through the service.\\n\\nFast forward less than a month later to today, and both of our results are in. Sarah comes over to spend the weekend and we go through our results together on our laptops. We compare our ancestry and health reports and nothing seems off. I even found out I\\'m 2% Native American. All was well until we arrived at the \"DNA relatives\" section...\\n\\nSarah tightly holds my hand and says \"I hope we both find our fathers\". Then I open mine up....\\n\\nAt the top of my screen, I see Sarah\\'s name.... \"27% DNA shared...half-sister..........\"\\n\\nSarah starts hysterically laughing and tells me to stop joking. \\n\\nI don\\'t react to anything she says, and just stare at my screen in disbelief. \\n\\nI then abruptly grab her laptop and open up her \"DNA relatives\" section. We see the same thing. My name at the top... \"27% DNA shared...half-brother\" \\n\\nAt this moment my brain just completely short-circuits.....\\n\\nI\\'VE BEEN HAVING SEX WITH MY HALF-SISTER. HOLY FUCKING SHIT. WTF\\n\\nMy mind starts going a 100mph and I began hyperventilating, going into a state of shock. I can\\'t even remember what Sarah was doing at this time.\\n\\nIt\\'s pretty self-explanatory by now, but for those of you who don\\'t understand how we could be related, it turns out our moms were probably both fertilized by the same sperm sample. What are the fucking odds, right? The fact that we\\'re from the same town certainly increased the odds but still. \\n \\n6 hours later, just typing this entire post makes my body shiver. There are no words I have to express what my mental state is now. To put it in simple words: I feel traumatized. Part of me still won\\'t stop thinking about how much I love Sarah and then I realize our entire relationship was incest. I honestly feel disgusted standing in my own skin. I\\'ve even been contemplating suicide.\\n\\nSarah and I haven\\'t talked at all since going into shock. \\n\\nRight as I\\'m finishing up this post, Sarah has grabbed her stuff and left my apartment a few moments ago.\\n\\nI\\'m probably not going to respond to any of your comments/questions for now and I honestly want to be left alone in the corner of my room. I really just needed a place to vent all this.\\n\\nTL;DR: Former gf and I are both sperm donor babies and come from the same town. We take a 23andme DNA test and find out we\\'re each other\\'s half-sibling. Meaning I\\'ve been having sex with my sister for over a year. Turns out we both were conceived from the same sperm sample, go figure. \\n\\nI do not give permission for my post to be used in the making of any movie, story, book, etc. \\n\\nEDIT: My mates just came home and are giving me support. \\n\\nEDIT 2: RIP inbox. Thank you all so much for the support. I just logged back in and didn\\'t really expect this post to blow up. Last night was rough. Sarah\\'s friend/roommate called letting me know Sarah was home. As of now, Sarah and I still haven\\'t talked. But after an night of thinking, I believe I\\'ve come to terms with what we\\'ve discovered. For those of you who still think this is fake (I honestly wish it was), here\\'s a screenshot showing our shared DNA (https://i.imgur.com/Z0zm9xi.png).\\nI think the best way for Sarah and I to heal is to go back home (our town) and see how this all began with our families. Only then will we be able to accept the reality. I\\'ll post more updates as things develop.   In a nod to u/prolificshoelace \\'s recent post, I remembered something from my own time in school and thought it was worth posting. This was some time around 2007.\\n\\nI too was a computer geek in school and loved trying to get around the school\\'s restrictions on what you could do. Things like spamming left click to send thousands of outlook emails to other students & crash their inbox etc.\\n\\nOne time in IT class we were working on video editing and I\\'d completed mine and wanted to copy the file to a USB stick. The school used a piece of software called RM Tutor for teachers to monitor, freeze and control students\\' machines. Of course this was normally locked to certain accounts but they forgot to remove a context menu for student accounts when right clicking a media file.\\n\\nSeeing this I knew exactly what power we just found. I clicked \"Open with RM Tutor\" and it opened with full access. I closed the video and began exploring the program. For a test, I froze my friend\\'s keyboard inputs and it worked! Then I used annotate and drew a dick on someone else\\'s screen. All friends so nobody told on me.\\n\\nMy best friend sat next to me was into computers too and wanted to have a poke around so I showed him how to open it. He had a porn video on hand and thought it would be funny to play it on someone\\'s screen across the room from us..... however, he had not messed around with the software as much as I had and had clicked GO before I had a chance to show him.\\n\\nEvery screen showed this girl getting plowed. Not just in our class, not just on students machines, not even just half the screens. It played on EVERY computer screen in the damn school (including the headmaster\\'s). We tried to play dumb and say we had no idea but the school\\'s technician checked the logs and ratted us out.\\n\\nTHANKFULLY because we were top performers for IT and didn\\'t have any bad records they let us off in exchange for showing them how we did it so they could fix it.\\n\\nTL;DR found out how to access teacher software, messed around and streamed a porn video to every screen in the school.\\n\\nQuick edit; from googling it looks like it was RM Tutor 3. I vaguely remember it being not long after they move from an old version. [Here you go](https://imgur.com/gallery/mlGMyZQ)\\n\\nSo here are the pictures of my gunshot injury that you all asked for. The first one is pretty gnarly, and NSFL. \\n\\nThe other pictures are of my X-rays both before and after surgery. I have been blessed with some great doctors and nurses that have kept me going. \\n\\nAlso: for those of you that were dicks, messaging me saying I deserved to die or that I deserved worse than this, you guys have issues and need to develop some empathy. I know I’m just an internet stranger, but I could be you or your loved one. Nobody deserves a gunshot wound for handling a firearm that, while stored in a hazardous manner, was not packed up by me. Shit happens you guys, and you have no idea what my firearm safety habits are like the other 99% of the time I’m handling them. You expect me to be perfect when I guarantee many of you text and drive which is just as dangerous and can kill or hurt you or someone innocent. So try to not be so quick to hate and judge others over a freak accident. The only reason I was so complacent around this gun was because I never store anything loaded, so I had a false sense of security around a gun that wasn’t handled by me last. With that being said, I digress. \\n\\nStay safe everyone, Godspeed, and Rakkasan!\\n\\nTl;dr: shot myself in the leg, uploaded pictures, told people to not be hateful Obligatory this was a while ago.\\n\\nSo it\\'s a known fact amongst friends and family that I always have a poop or fart joke waiting to go. It\\'s just who I am. You can have your turgid penis and voluptuous vagina jokes, I\\'ll take a heaving helping of poop jokes with a squelching mound of fart stories any day of the week. If you\\'ve shat your pants in public I want to know, the more public and embarrassing the better, it\\'s not a sex thing I swear; I\\'ve just always been like that since I was a young child. There is something inherently humorous to a subject so personal and private and that will never change. \\n\\nThat knowledge combined with the events I am about to relay to you make me wonder if perhaps we do live in a world where unseen forces act to maximize the comedic value of my life.\\n\\nSome don\\'t believe me when I tell them this tale but there\\'s a link at the end with video evidence so suspend your disbelief and prepare to be grateful for your moderate home repair issues, it could be far worse.\\nHere we go.\\n\\nMy wife and I bought the house with a few minor problems that were handled during closing like all deals are, we knew there would be a few surprises from what friends and family said so we stashed some money aside and opened a Home Depot card for the promotional no interest purchases. \\n\\nSure enough the floor wasn\\'t insulted in the downstairs and since the crawlspace was hard to get around in to the inspector never caught it. I went ahead and purchased a load of insulation to re-insulate, whatever. It was summer and after getting married a few months earlier then moving we were exhausted so we worked on the interior of the house and the yard for the remainder of the good weather.\\n\\nDuring this time we\\'d get the occasional whiff of something stanky but didn\\'t think much of it. I\\'d buy some Draino and the smell would go away. Ok, the house has some plumbing issues, no biggie, $7 a week until we got the rest of the home under control and we\\'d get a plumber in to take look.\\nIt\\'s the week before Thanksgiving and I finally get under the house to work on that insulation. It\\'s cooler and everything is drying out for the winter. \\n\\nI\\'ve been in some crawl spaces that would gross the average human out before but this place, Jesus fucking Christ this place took the cake, blew a load all over it, force-fed it to a drugged out former child actor then bottled the shit they produced for resale at the local farmer\\'s market as a skin care product it was so evil. I knew right then we were in for a ride, the house had been flipped and if it wasn\\'t visible during a tour it had not been fixed.\\n\\nThat week I found 2 dead cats, an old stereo system from the 80s that had been hulk smashed, a car wheel, a broken window for a bar from New Hampshire (we\\'re in New York) and so much insulation it took fifteen extra large trash bags to remove among other random debris. Even with a respirator my nose still get clogged and I spend the remainder of the day with no sense of smell.\\n\\nAnyone who knows anything about homes will tell you when someone flips a house they tend to buy shitholes and plug them with some spackel to keep the streams of festering shit at bay before selling them to unsuspecting dupes like us. \\n\\nIf you\\'re buying a home that\\'s been flipped negotiate like you\\'re fucking the shit out of a fresh coconut that will be thrown away immediately like any normal person would because I guarantee you that those sellers have been hiding cum filled coconuts in the walls just waiting for you to find as you settle in and attempt to make changes to the home. They don\\'t give a fuck if the place falls apart next year because the reality of real estate law is it\\'s buyer beware. They deserve to make as little as fucking possible for their \"trouble\" so go in fucking if you want to come out satisfied. Then again I\\'m biased as you will come to find out.\\n\\nSo I\\'m under the house two days before Thanksgiving and hauling bags of old insulation out through a tiny hole I can barely fit through. My wife tells me she\\'s going to take a shower and won\\'t be able to help if I need anything. I crawl back under and figure I\\'ll grab another bag or two and call it quits.\\n\\nThen I hear the water. If you\\'re a homeowner the worst sound you can hear is water running where it shouldn\\'t be. That\\'s better than never hearing the water but it still means there\\'s a lot of water where it shouldn\\'t be any and if you don\\'t find it things get messy fast.I didn\\'t know much but I knew that.\\n\\nI hear a splattering that is roughly equivalent of a shower running but it sounds like water is pouring into a pool. I\\'ve owned a home for less than 4 months at this point so everything makes me nervous but this struck fear in my heart. It\\'s even coming from the corner of the crawlspace the inspector couldn\\'t get to because of ductwork making this urgent andsuper inconvenient.\\n\\nI\\'m about 100 pounds lighter than the inspector so I squirm my way over the main sewer line and over the field of nasty old insulation that would still take another ten bags to remove. Clouds of fiberglass cat piss dust are billowing and making it hard to see through my respirator. I wriggle under the main return air duct just barely making, something shifts and the fucker slides about 3 inches closer to the ground making a return from this side of the crawlsapce impossible. I sigh and keep going. My nose is always clogged from the moment I get down there, something about that dust just immediately makes it impossible for me to smell anything for a good couple of hours even though I make sure the respirator fits snugly against my face.\\n\\nThe light of my headlamp illuminates the problem, there\\'s a stream of water pouring from somewhere between the joists. I think to myself \"Great! The pipe broke?!\" and crawl forward to the sparkling stream. I climb over a mound and down the other side onto what I thought was dirt but the moment I touched it the layer of dirt on the water rippled with the water beneath it. I see the brown ripples spreading but it\\'s too late and the cool water floods into my gloves, moments later I realize my entire torso is wet as the water soaks through my jumpsuit. \"What the fuck!?\" this is more than a single shower. This is, like a month of showers in a dusty lake under our house. The water stops running and I decide it\\'s time to just get out of the crawlspace and call the plumber. We put away money specifically for stuff like this, it won\\'t be fun but whatever.\\n\\nI\\'m moister than an oyster at this point and take a soggy second to look over the tangle of pipes and mountains of dirt - weird the floor should be flat but whatever - searching for a path to where there\\'s a space behind the furnace I\\'ll be able to slide through. I see it and start slogging through the sludgy mud trying to figure out what it\\'s going to cost to drain this water so the plumber can work. \\n\\nThe I hear it. A toilet flush. It didn\\'t hit me until it hit me, the better part of a flush splattered across my back unleashing a sub-human scream of disgust and outrage. I turned back to try to see where it\\'s coming from and respirator caught on a random old pipe sticking out of the ground sliding to the side. \\n\\nA whiff of unadulterated corruption made it to my clogged crawlspace dust filled sinuses. Jesus, Buddha, Sagan, anyone with temporal admin rights wind this horror story back and get me out of here. Send me back to the womb, let me start over, I want to start over; we have to go back, Kate!\\nI\\'m sure you\\'re thinking \"Why the fuck would my wife shit after showering?\" I thought same thing, to be honest I don\\'t know, she married me; I livestream jars of meat for my own personal entertainment, I guess she\\'s going to be a little off, too.\\n\\nThe realization of how far up shit\\'s creek I am soaked into my brain at the same speed of that which soaked into my back. The upstairs bathroom wasn\\'t on the tax documents prior to the seller\\'s ownership, it was part of the renovation. Someone fucked up bigly and since the house wasn\\'t occupied after the renovation this is only now coming to light. Holy shit I\\'m crawling through three months of shit, my shit, my wife\\'s shit, my father in law\\'s shit! \\n\\nMemories of every shit I\\'d taken since moving in coursed through a mind imploding with revulsion like some nightmarish montage complete with the disembodied image of some arch nemesis cackling in the corner of the vision. We had numerous taco nights, I had discovered a sale on discount hot dogs a month earlier and had an entirely unrelated case of food poisoning a week after that was so bad I was showering instead of wiping. All of that was down here, with me, on me, soaking into me.\\n\\nThe panic set in and I scrambled up and over the mound that when it broke under my frantic grasping revealed yet-to-decompose toilet paper and slimy fecal matter complete with a visible kernel of corn, the metaphorical cherry on top of this unholy shit-cake that I was scrambling through.\\n\\nFive minutes later my wife comes downstairs and finds me in the downstairs shower, which was also not attached to the sewer, crying hysterically, the stress of finding one thing after another leading up to me crawling through my own waste had been too much. I could only hope that in time the stains burned into my memory would fade.\\n\\nToday we joke about it because what the fuck else can you do? We had it fixed, we moved on. We still can\\'t believe we never smelled it bad enough to think more than a backed up drain. We started taking classes on how to repair your own home and are learning as much about basic home repair as we can. We are wiser and more capable today, this kind of disaster won\\'t happen again.\\n\\nAs promised, video proof. https://youtu.be/tofGWfM6sJA\\n\\nSince I’ve been asked here’s my Meatstream. I think  the heat wave killed the maggots. EDIT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wT2I6vYbCSY Meatstream is back, the heatwave made my laptop overheat. EDIT: Also on Twitch, https://www.twitch.tv/chriswalkerguy\\n\\nTo answer your questions yes we had an inspector and no New York State does not hold inspectors liable for anything but after several other far more expensive issues and discovery of discrepancies in the sale documents an attorney has taken the case.\\n\\nTL;DR I bought a house where the sellers had not attached the pipes to the sewer and the crawlspace prevented the inspector from catching it. I learned about this 3 months after the sale while crawling through the puddle of poops.  Firstly, in my defence, I have been stuck at home for 10 weeks and have forgotten the usual rules of society. \\nI decided to attend to some unfathomably long nipple hairs in my living room. I mean, these suckers were long enough to braid. I was considering donating them to science, but decided instead to pluck them. I have never let them grow this long before. In fact, I didn\\'t know it was possible for nipple hairs to grow this long on a female human with no hormonal problems, but there we are.\\nI should mention, i am a woman with quite sizeable funbags. I love my girls. \\nI have a large living room window, and usually I dont get anyone walking in front of it, as there is a hedge dividing next door\\'s front garden and mine. What I didn\\'t know is that next door have trimmed the hedge over the weekend. \\nSo there i am, baps totally out, contorting them into an Impossible shape so i can get to the hard- to- reach massively long hairs sprouting proudly into the air. I had my tongue poking out, because as we all know, it\\'s easier to concentrate that way. \\nTweezers in one hand, boob in the other, plucking away with tongue exposed, I look up to see the postman frozen in what can only be described as a petrified stare, with a look of total horror on his face. Our eyes met. I froze too.\\nI think he must have taken a short cut from next door, I think I can confidently say he will probably go the long way round tomorrow.\\n\\nTL;DR tifu by plucking my nipple hairs in the living room when the postman walked by and was horrified. This happened 1 week ago. I\\'m a man, my best friend is a woman. It was before class and I had my laptop opened up to chat... \\n\\nShe had said to me, for whatever reason, \"do you wanna see me eat this taco?\"\\n\\nAnd I, being open to and accepting of her antics, replied \"do I ever!\"\\n\\nAfter a few minutes of nothing back, I went up to ask the professor a question. While the professor was explaining something to me I noticed a very dramatic flurry of reactions from those seated around my computer screen.\\n\\nNow, my friend is great but she is also wildly inappropriate and I knew immediately that she had sent something super weird... Everyone was staring and laughing at me. One guys was smiling and nodding. I could feel my whole head turning beat red as I took the long walk back to my seat.\\n\\nWhen I got back my heart lurched as I saw that what she had actually sent was essentially a picture of her deepthroating a burrito while looking directly into the camera... To make matters worse, she had typed \"YOU PERVERT\" across the top in big blue letters, so there was no possible way to interpret it as anything else... I was horrified. How do you explain to your classmates the kind of friendship dynamic that leads up to you getting pictures like that?\\n\\nAfter that point there was no coming back, every single thing I did or said somehow seemed to confirm in everyone\\'s mind that I am just some weirdo dude who gets girls to send him pictures of them choking on food... I am still super embarrassed and probably will be until this class is over.\\n\\nTL;DR: My friend sent me a weird and suggestive photo that my entire class saw and now everyone thinks I get off to girls stuffing food down their throat.\\n\\nEdit: Wow gee thanks guys I was hoping by sharing this amusing story that I would be made to question all my feelings. Simply grand!\\n\\nEdit: I\\'m not gonna show the picture I got too many messages from people who want it for masturbatory reasons. There really isn’t a non-NSFW version of this story but I’ll try to be delicate.\\n\\nI have trouble sleeping, so I generally masturbate before bed and pass out after a couple orgasms. It’s the difference between lying awake for hours and falling asleep in 20 minutes.\\n\\nI use a vibrator that basically acts like a clit sucker; a silicone membrane flexes inside a little cup area and creates a pulsing sensation on whatever you put it on. It’s intended for clitoral use. It’s uh, very effective.\\n\\nThis morning I woke up and went to the bathroom as usual. My clit felt kind of sore but that happens occasionally. I briefly wondered if I had masturbated for too long last night but I couldn’t remember.\\n\\nFast forward to now when I’m tidying up my room and I go to charge my vibrator. It’s usually stuffed somewhere in the covers or I put it next to my glasses.\\n\\nI couldn’t find it and realized I must have fallen asleep using it, so I checked the whole bed. I checked under the bed by the headboard, and there it was—aaaand the silicone part is covered in blood.\\n\\nI momentarily thought “oh no my period is two weeks early, wtf” then I took a peek in the mirror at my bits.\\n\\nYup. I fell asleep masturbating and wounded my clit hood. The battery on a low setting can last for hours so uh, I guess I had a rough night.\\n\\nNow I probably can’t masturbate for several days while it heals. Sigh.\\n\\ntl;dr: I use a vibrator with a sucking feature, tore/cut my clitoral hood in my sleep This didn’t just happen, this was about a year ago when the staff in my office was 95% southern ladies over 65 years old. They were mostly retired, working part time as office staff. And they LOVED potlucks, they lived for them, to the point where we had one pretty much every month. They honestly didn’t need a reason to bring in a ton of food, and I had to problem eating it. The day the fuck up happened was a potluck day, and when I was putting my food in the break room fridge I saw someone had brought in a banana pudding. It was beautiful, covered in whipped cream in a pretty crystal dish, and you know it was made with grandma love. I love banana pudding, and I made a mental note to save room for some. \\n\\nSo lunch time comes, and I’m sitting there with everyone surrounded by all the food, when I remember the banana pudding. I grab a huge bowl of it, and I see that there’s also a layer of sliced banana mixed in with the pudding and wafers and whipped cream, and I’ve never had it with real banana before. So I start eating it, it’s delicious of course, and I tell that to the lady who made it. And then I say “I’ve never had banana pudding with actual bananas in it! You’d think the tingling would affect the taste, but it doesn’t!” Everyone looks at me. Sweet little old lady asks “what tingling?” I’m still focused on food, so I don’t notice the odd look on everyone’s face. I say “you know! That tingling, pop rocks feeling you get when you eat a banana?” Blank stares from everyone. Now I’m starting to feel nervous. I ask if anyone else there feels that. They have not. \\n\\nThen the sweetest, oldest lady of the bunch leans over and pats me on the back and says “bless your heart, I think you’re just allergic to bananas.” For those who don’t know, saying ‘bless your heart’ is southern lady speak for ‘well you’re an idiot, aren’t you?’. I finished the banana pudding, but they never let me live that day down. Sometimes I would come in and they would leave a banana on my desk as a reminder. Jokes on them though, I’d still eat them. \\n\\nTL:DR I thought it was normal for your mouth to tingle after eating a banana. It turns out I’m just allergic to bananas and the old ladies I work with thought I was an idiot.\\n\\nEdit: Wow I can’t believe how popular my fuck up got! Thanks for the gold! I mentioned this to the ladies who are still working in the office and they say thank you for making them internet famous! Obligatory this happened on Monday. So, I have been single for a while and a friend of mine gave me a contact last year, saying you and this girl will probably get along well. And that we did, from December to this month we have steadily been growing closer and having tonnes of fun along the way. Sans sexual flirting though. I even nicknamed her my almost soulmate because things just flowed between us. Until last week Friday when I decided to visit her for Easter (she stays in a nearby city).\\n\\nNow remember I\\'ve been single for a long time.  And my raging-hormone to logic ratio is at an all time high, thanks to a total lack of outlets. So when she said the entire visit should be spent indoors I thought Finally. This is where it happens. I packed 2 condoms to the visit and sprayed deo like a mad man. Got there and things were going great really, until after one hour of YouTube videos I got nervous and then desperate BUT I didn\\'t make a move. For some reason I believed something would magically happen and we would end up in sexy time. You can imagine my inevitable disappointment when I had to leave.\\n\\nSo just before we parted she suggested we take pictures and I said cool but really all I could think about was how I had failed at the only booty chance I had had in a year. Needless to say I didn\\'t look overly enthusiastic, or even remotely happy on the pictures. Which apparently bothered her as she thought I didn\\'t want pics with her because she is ugly (which she isn\\'t) and for the weekend she kept on bringing it up and I kept on saying I was really anxious to travel back home in time. Which of course she didn\\'t buy and eventually I thought hey let me just tell her the truth. So on Monday I sent her a pic of the condoms and explained my disappointment and sexual frustration, trying to reassure her that she isn\\'t ugly.\\n\\nAnd now, well, its been 3 days since we spoke. Thanks, Hormone Monster.\\n\\n**TL;DR: Confessed that I was disappointed we didn\\'t get to sexy time with a good friend and now she won\\'t text me**\\n\\n**Edit: So, this kinda blew up lol. Thanks for the silver, kind strangers! And uhhh as for those suggesting I have zero social knowledge you\\'re absolutely right, had no idea I would receive my awakening from this app. Also thanks to all the kind inboxes offering advice. And I know this is sad but the meta jokes around my post history are killing me! Spray moderate deo y\\'all. Oh and since when is sexy time no longer standard nomenclature??**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**Update**: We are now talking again but it\\'s still understandably slow and too early to tell if the conversation will be sustainable. And yes, I did apologize profusely, she mostly expressed confusion as to why I thought something would happen but that\\'s a whole different story. Thanks to all the people giving advice in the comments, I\\'m hoping it helps me both short and long term. As for the special strangers who rightly sensed that I would be overwhelmed with some of the negativity (honestly its just the people taking my other posts out of context or at least putting them in this context), I am truly amazed at your genuine kindness. I hope to be a similar positive influence one day. OK...I was awakened this morning by my dad saying, \"Hey Dude! You\\'re famous!\" Last night he posted a story about me giving my bully a beatdown. We read through the comments together and I want to say that I am overwhelmed at the support I have recieved, not only for knocking my bully TFO but also for the two surgeries I went through. First of all, I wanted to give you guys some proof because I keep seeing post about this being fake. Here are some pics of me, before and after my surgeries and a shamless karma whoring pic of my dog and family. We are a big clan and we are very close.\\n\\nHere is a link to the original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bvu086/tifu\\\\_by\\\\_giving\\\\_my\\\\_son\\\\_permission\\\\_to\\\\_beat\\\\_his/](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/bvu086/tifu_by_giving_my_son_permission_to_beat_his/)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHere are the pics of me:\\n\\n[https://imgur.com/a/dJ5zlDc](https://imgur.com/a/dJ5zlDc)\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTo clarify, the kid who hit me in the chest was a good friend of mine. He did not intend to hurt me. We were just clowning around. The kid who bullied me would just slap me or punch me. I thought he would stop but he never did. I didn\\'t want my brother to do anything about it because I was scared he would get hurt again. He had a Level 2 Traumatic Brain Injury from a mountain biking accident and everyone is very protective of him. To those of you who say I should have told on the kid. That is a terrible idea. That would just serve to put a bigger target on my back. Then it would have been twenty bullies hitting me every day. \\n\\nAlso, I feel bad for the kid I hit. I feel like his home life isn\\'t all that great. He is always looking for attention. I tried talking to him afterwards but he didn\\'t want to. I did talk to his brother, though, and he was glad I punched him. \\n\\nAs far as the surgey goes, I think I will do a AMA on that because I saw a lot of questions about it from people who have Pectus and are curious about the surgery. \\n\\nTL;DR: My dad posted about me beating up my bully and now I spent an entire sunny, Idaho day inside reading posts and laughing at my dad. This actually happened about 3Yrs ago.\\nOkay, so that title makes me sound like a huge asshole. Let me give some backstory:\\n\\nMy girlfriend B was going to school in a different city from where I lived so I would go to visit her once a month for a weekend. I would stay at her place and we would have a nice weekend before I had to head back home to work.\\n\\nWell, one night we get ready for bed and we both end up falling asleep, I have my right arm laid across her and everything is fine. Then my subconscious mind does it’s thing.\\n\\nI’m having a dream that I have died and gone to heaven. I’m standing at the pearly gates and there is a pulpit with a huge book, an inkwell, and a quill. This is some sort of sign in process before you are allowed to pass through the pearly gates. Well I pick up the quill and go to sign my name, and nothing gets written on the page! I keep trying to write my name so I can get on with things and it keeps not writing! Needless to say, I was getting quite aggravated and my writing becomes more aggressive, I’m talking big ass letters to fill the whole page and still NOTHING! I finally get frustrated and smack the book off the pedestal and wake up to my girlfriend yelling at me!\\n\\nTurns out, while I was asleep trying to write in this holy sign-in sheet, my arm was also keeping up with me, waving all over the place across my girlfriend while she was sleeping. When I smacked the book off the pedestal, my arm followed suit and smacked the shit out of my girlfriends face...\\n\\nI explained to her what was going on in my dream and she just looks at me and dead seriously asks “well did you dip the quill in the ink?” Well as a matter of fact I hadn’t, so that solved my issue and I rolled over and went back to sleep.\\n\\nTl;dr: fell asleep, couldn’t write in a book, smacked dream book and my girlfriend. Carefull if you read on, this is a bit graphical. \\n\\nSo this happened last year.\\n\\nI was sleeping when I woke up because my penis was itching. Hapenes sometimes I guess. So I scratch it and try to go back to sleep, but it didn\\'t stop. So I scratch it again, more vigorously this time.\\n\\nIt worked and I fall back asleep, just to be woken up by some really bad pain down there. I lift the blanket to see what\\'s going on and almost had a stroke.\\n\\nMy penis didn\\'t look like a penis anymore. It looked like an inflated balloon. Like I had a Sack growing out of my usual Sack, making me look like I had two scrotum and no dick. It was red and hot and it hurt so bad I almost puked.\\n\\nI must have screamed or something without noticing cause my roommate nocked at the door to see if I was alright. By then I was crying like a baby. Damn it hurt so bad. I told him to call a cab - I didn\\'t even think of an ambulance my mind was all over the place. Is it going to pop? What if they have to amputate it. When I say it looked grotesque I mean it. Like two avocados joined at the hip, but one avocado was my penis and the other one my balls.\\n\\nSo I put on my baggiest pants and my roommate, God bless, brought me to the hospital where I would have needed to wait if it wasn\\'t for a friend\\'s mom who worked there. We called her on our way and she waited at the hospital door with two nurses.\\n\\nThey put me on that roll table and down we go to what I thought would be my last ride with penis attached.\\n\\nWe get in the room and they check me out. I tried not to look, still crying while three adult women were checking my manhood. Talk about your ego beeing crushed. In the next half hour I had about ten more people check out my condition. At some point I thought they were just coming in to see something out of the ordinary. \"Yo, you wanna see a guy\\'s penis inflated like a balloon?\" \\n\\nOne doctor, and I\\'m not kidding, while asking me, who was in tears, if it hurt, while poking it. \\n\\nAnyway it turns out I had a microscratch and some bacteria came in. They treated me with antibiotics and next day it got worse and I had a sepsis. So now I was almost dying and of course my penis was the reason. Allways be getting me into trouble... \\n\\nTurns out they used the wrong antibiotic. They changed it and had me on an IV of antibiotics and opiates constantly. Took about a week for my peewee to look like an actual penis again and two more weeks to be \"normal\" again.\\n\\nTldr. : Scratched my penis in my sleep, got bacteria in, had a sepsis in the hospital and almost died.\\n\\nEdit: FAQs\\n\\n1. I was informed a couple of hours ago that one is given a broad spectrum antibiotic at first untill the cause of the infection is clear and then you get the \"right\" one. So no malpractice there.\\n\\n2. I also learned that the infection likely was already there and the scratching just exaserbated it\\n\\n3. \"An tomatoe\" was a typo, I swear... Also my first language is German so have some sympathy. ;)\\n\\n4. Obligatory thanks for the awards. \\n\\n5. Wash your hands - got it. Not that I don\\'t, but still sound advice... Especially these days :D\\n\\n6. Cats might have been in nvolved in this, as they always sleep next to me in bed and something might have come on the sheets.\\n\\n7. Medical bills were 13€ including meds for after I left the hospital... Full Healthcare ftw. I\\'m in Austria.\\n\\n8. I\\'ve been asked for pictures so many times even in the dms. I only have a short video, but watch at your own cost, it\\'s disturbing:\\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ So, girlfriend had a long day of work. So I decided to be the good boyfriend and rub her feet. Being an Asian, I gotta pull out my tiger balm whenever I give a massage. It’s this herbal mixture ointment that gives you this extreme 2 in 1 chill & hot sensation. (Side tip, put some on before you go in sauna.\\n\\nAnyway, she’s white and she has never seen that thing. I put some on her feet and rub the usual pressure points and she couldn’t stop “oofing”. I asked her to put some on my back too. Fast forward 20 minutes, she’s on top of me and we are making out. Just the natural progression of massage -> sexy time. \\n\\nI started fingering her. She asked me if I use the hand that touch the paste. Not realizing she was asking about the tiger balm, I continue on fingering her. 30 seconds later she rolled over and said my vajayjay is burning. She ran off to the bathroom while I am sitting in bed typing this up. Oops \\n\\nTL;DR. I sat her vagina on fire while shoving ice cube in. So this happened like 2 hours ago, but it needs some preface.\\n\\nAbout 3 weeks ago my neighbor saw me dressed in all black leaving for work and he asked me, “Who died?” I laughed. He laughed. We all had a good time. Today—I’m heading to my car, and I see him and his wife dressed in all black so I obviously asked, “Who died?”\\n \\nHis wife breaks down and starts HARDCORE CRYING. Turns out her mom had just died. She then proceeds to lecture me about making fun of death as she’s still crying at a 6/10. Her husband never said anything about the fact that he made the same joke 3 weeks ago, which is fine. I wouldn’t have either. \\n\\nSo now I’m gonna avoid her forever. I know it’s not the craziest TIFU, but now I’ll respect death forever.\\n\\nTL;DR I asked my neighbor “Who died?” And it turns out someone had actually died. Got a nice lecture on death. Link to my previous post:\\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/af5h58/tifu_by_finding_out_ive_been_accidentally_dating/\\n\\nSame updated [posted here](https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/am8cr1/23andme_has_just_shown_that_ive_been_accidentally/) on r/23andme.\\n\\nFirst things first, just wow. I can\\'t thank you all enough for the support through the kind comments and messages. I wish I could reply to all of them, but there are just too many. \\n\\nI\\'ll answer some common questions I received towards the end of the post, but I\\'ll first start with where we left off. \\n\\nAfter a long dreadful night full of surprises, I woke up the next morning questioning everything. I called bullshit on the test and immediately called Sarah. She picks up telling me she\\'s already booked an appointment with a Genetic counselor. Good, we\\'re both on the same page.  \\n\\nThe next day, we meet with the genetic counselor specifying in patients who take tests with commercial companies. TLDR of what she said was, while the Ancestry reports can be interpreted with a degree of skepticism, DNA matches are determined directly through the raw DNA data, meaning the connection is either there or it isn\\'t. We asked if there was a possibility that we contaminated each other\\'s samples. She said that our samples would have been flagged by the system (apparently that\\'s easy to spot). Even if our \\'contaminated\\' samples magically made it through the system, we would have been shown to be sharing completely identical segments, while 23andme showed we only share half identical segments. \\n\\nIt was basically confirmed by a specialist at this point and the same feeling of dread I had the other night began to set in again. My friend called an hour later, telling Sarah and I to upload our raw data to a 3rd party dna site online, as extra confirmation. We did just that, and surprise surprise, we\\'re shown as being half-siblings.\\n\\nSarah and I spent the rest of the day calling both of our parents and explaining everything. We all came to the conclusion of Sarah and I taking a weekend trip back home, to see how this all started. This idea came to me the same night when the whole ordeal began. \\n\\nEver since that night, Sarah and I, understandably, haven\\'t been the same. I\\'ve been trying to mentally cope with my emotions. The logic part of me is telling me \"Incest bad, not right, break up\" while emotionally, I still love Sarah. I\\'m having this constant battle in my head, and I\\'m sure Sarah is too. All of this was especially apparent when Friday rolled around. We both packed our bags and hopped into my car. During our ENTIRE drive up North towards home, not a single fucking word from the both of us. 5 hours later, we finally made it to Sarah\\'s house (the agreed meeting destination). Right before we exit the car, my brain decides to short-circuit. I grab Sarah\\'s hand and lean into kiss her. She stops me, looks me in the eyes, and after brief pause while teary-eyed says \"No matter what the outcome of all this will be, I\\'ll be leaving having gained a brother.\" That shit hit me HARD. We both hug each other and start crying. For the first time in nearly a week, I felt some kind of relief while simultaneously thinking \"WTF is going on\". Sarah and I both being the emotional meat bags we are, stop hugging and head inside before one of us mentally breaks down (again). \\n\\n2 hours later my parents arrive, and we all sit down and formally meet for the first time. Oh yeah, did I forget to mention how this is the first time both my parents and I are meeting Sarah\\'s family? Imagine how fucking awkward that shit is. I\\'ll spare you all the cringeful details of all of us trying to make the whole situation a \\'normal conversation\\'. \\n\\nBoth of our mother\\'s brought the sperm donor IDs. For those of you who don\\'t know what that is, when a woman has received a sperm donor sample from a cryo-bank, it comes with a ID that is unique to that specific donor. Our mother\\'s compare the IDs and... they\\'re a match. Sarah and I were conceived from the same donor (which we had already guessed to be the case).\\n\\nThe rest of the night was spent discussing what to do going on. As much as I still had feelings for her, Sarah and I came to the conclusion of breaking up. We decided to go to a bi-weekly counseling therapist, to help us get past all this crap and transition into a sibling relationship. \\n\\nWe spent the rest of our weekend catching up with our families and headed back to uni on Monday. \\n\\nAs of now, 12 days later, Sarah and I are going to therapy together and we\\'ve maintained a friendly relationship, still keeping in touch throughout the week. Mentally, we\\'re both much better but still have a long way to go. It\\'s to early to tell, but I have hope for the future.\\n\\nQ&A:\\n\\nQ: When were you both conceived?\\n\\nA: We were both conceived a month apart, and born 5 weeks apart.\\n\\n\\nQ: Do you guys look alike?\\n\\nA: No, not really. The only thing we \\'have in common\\' are our somewhat similar noses. \\n\\n\\nQ: What were your ancestry results?\\n\\nA: Idk why this was a really common question I got through pm, but [here you go](https://www.reddit.com/r/23andme/comments/am85w9/my_results/)\\n\\n\\nQ: What town are you both from?\\n\\nA: No\\n\\n\\nQ: Why do you both care? You should stay together.\\n\\nA: There\\'s no way that\\'s happening in this society, nor do I want it to happen. We\\'d have to deal with social and even legal problems (depending on the state). Also, we\\'d run the risk of conceiving a genetically unhealthy child if we chose to have kids. \\n\\n\\nQ: Were you two able to find your biological father?\\n\\nA: Sarah and I didn\\'t match closely (in terms of 1st cousins and up) with anyone else on 23andme, and as of now, we no longer have a desire to find our bio-father. The genetic counselor mentioned we should keep an eye out for any future half-siblings taking the test.\\n\\nTLDR: Confirmed incest with specialist, went back home with ex-gf/half-sister, moms confirmed the same sperm sample. Sarah and I have maintained a \\'sibling-like\\' relationship and are currently in therapy. \\n\\n This happened many years ago.  At the time, I was a 6th grade teacher.  I was teaching my students about Darwin and the Galapagos Islands.  The islands are off the coast of South America.  So I wanted the students to understand the geography and I drew South America on my smart board.  I\\'m not good at drawing and didn\\'t really care how it came out because I just needed to show them approximately where the islands were located.  So I very quickly drew South America and it ended up looking like a cock and balls.  Naturally, since this was a middle school, 2 boys in the class started laughing.  After class, I pulled them aside and said how it wasn\\'t appropriate and that it could make people uncomfortable.  Right about then, one of the boys\\' eyes rolled back and he fainted.  I caught him on the way down and laid him on the floor.  Turns out he has never gotten in trouble in his life and has a heart condition.  So the stress of me just talking to him caused his heart rate to rise and he fainted.  Needless to say, it was an interesting day.  He was totally fine.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL/DR: I accidentally drew a cock and balls on my smart board.  Two students laughed so I talked with them after class about why they shouldn\\'t do that.  One of the two boys fainted because he had a heart condition and had never been in trouble in his life.\\n\\nEdit: Just want to add: I was not yelling or mean in any way. Just a chat about time and place. I still regret what happened but want to make sure no one thinks I was shaming them. I was just talking with them so they would reflect on it. I also admitted that it was partially my fault for making such a stupid drawing.\\n\\nSecond edit: I did not talk to the students because I wanted to be strict or was being humorless. I did so because I needed to ensure that my classroom was not a place where sexual humor was allowed. The students were 11. I didn’t think it was a big deal myself, but the  parents of the other students might have.\\n\\nThird edit: Thank you to anonymous redditor(s) who gave me gold!  First gold ever! This fuck up happened yesterday at night time.\\n\\nMy bf and I have a habit of trying to poke our index fingers into each others butthole. (nice introduction to our relationship btw)\\nThis has been fun and games until last night.\\nBefore bed time we decided to clean up the mess we made during the day. So I went into the kitchen to clean some wooden cutting boards. My bf stands behind me judging my washing up skills and walks away. To scare my anxious little arse off, he switches the lights off and crawls really fast towards me to poke my buttocks. Me, being confused because of sudden darkness, turn around, see this unholy shadow creature trying to propably kill me and decide to smack the wooden cutting board I just washed up in his face without hesitation.\\nOne *clonk* sound later I realised this demon was indeed my bf. \\nBut the real fuck up is I destroyed his glasses and opticians are closed because of our best friend COVID-19. At least I didn\\'t hit his face directly. Now he has to fix his glasses with duct tape but he assured me he is not mad at me because he\\'s wanted a new one anyways.\\n\\ntl;dr - Ninja gf has mad reflexes and accidentally destroys bf\\'s glasses by trying to fight crawling demon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUPDATE: \\nWhew, this blew up. I most certainly did not expect that. Thank you, guys! So many people said my bf could buy cheap glasses via various websites which is really nice but we are from Germany and I don\\'t know whether these services even ship here. Also his glasses are somewhat fine. The duct tape situation seems to work for now. :)\\nIn addition to that I wanted to excuse the spelling/meaning errors which may have occured. I\\'m not native to this language. Sorry!\\nTo make this clear: I\\'m often really scared in the dark. Hence my strong reaction to being scared. :) ^Obligatory: ^This ^didn\\'t ^happen ^today, ^but ^over ^the ^summer. ^also ^warning ^some ^NSFW ^language.\\n\\n^TL;DR ^first ^because ^it\\'s ^long: ^Went ^to ^Eiffel ^Tower ^to ^watch ^Euro ^2016 ^finals, ^ended ^up ^in ^a ^[riot](http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/euro-2016-french-riot-police-fire-tear-gas-at-supporters-outside-paris-fan-zone-during-france-match-a7129906.html) ^because ^we ^ran ^late, ^got ^tear ^gassed, ^girlfriend ^dislocated ^knee, ^her ^phone ^stolen, ^my ^nose ^broken, ^and ^our ^passports ^stolen.\\n\\n**BACKGROUND:** My girlfriend (who we\\'ll call Emily) and I were in Paris on the very first day of a month long backpacking trip in Europe. We spent the whole morning smoking hash at Sacré-Coeur with some new friends, who told us that the Euro 2016 final between France and Portugal was that night. They told us to meet them to watch the game at the \\'fan zone\\' at the Eiffel Tower but urged us *not to be late,* otherwise we wouldn\\'t get into the \\'fan zone.\\' \\n\\nBeing jet-lagged and burnt out from the hash, we took a nap before heading down, but overslept by an hour. We figured we\\'d head down to the Eiffel Tower anyway and see what was going on. whoops.\\n\\n**THE FUCK UP:** Arriving at the Eiffel Tower we realize there isn\\'t any fanzone to be found, or so we think. It turns out we are in the [completely wrong place](http://imgur.com/a/8PES8) on the opposite side of the tower from the fan zone, and amongst a crowd of mostly troublemakers that is about to erupt into a riot. \\n\\nThe first signs of chaos are a small group of youths antagonizing police underneath the tower, and when we see a massive line of riot police facing in our general direction, we decide it\\'s time to leave. \\nAs we make our way through the crowd I hear screaming and look up in horror to see a smoking projectile sailing through the sky, headed right for us. The crowd around us scatters, knocking Emily and I down, where a **tear gas canister blows up mere feet from our faces**. \\n\\n\"Get up! We have to go!\" I\\'m screaming at Emily but I notice she\\'s crying & screaming out in pain, not from the tear gas in our eyes but from the fact that **her knee is so broken the thing might as well be on Mars.** I throw her over my shoulder and go sprinting through clouds of tear gas out of the chaos and onto the Pont d\\'Iena bridge, where some guy **snatches Emily\\'s phone out of her hand**. I turn and watch helplessly as the guy runs off into the crowd, Emily screaming \"he took my phone!\" \\n\\n\"Fuck the phone!\" I run as far as my arms/legs allow and then set her down. I need to get her to an ambulance, but I can\\'t leave her to find one, so I need someone to help me. So I start screaming at the crowd around me for someone to help, forgetting that I am amongst almost nothing but riff-raff of the worst variety. Nobody helps me or seems to give a shit, so I pick her up and run as far as I can and set her down again. A crowd gathers ogling my girlfriend\\'s knee and staring at me blankly as I shout shit they don\\'t understand like \"911! AMBULANCE!\" \\n\\nIt\\'s then I am disgusted to notice a hand reaching from Emily\\'s purse to my back pocket, and I slap it away forcefully, standing up from a crouching position as I do so, screaming \"FUCK OUT OF HERE!\" I look into the eyes of the perpetrator, a young African guy who loads up and punches me in the face, **shattering my nose**. As blood spurts out of my nose I look at the guy and say with genuine bewilderment \"are you fucking kidding me?\" He looks at me blankly like he is genuinely surprised to see me still on my feet and spitting profanity at him. I scoop up my girlfriend and start running for our lives. \\n\\nI\\'m now running on what I am convinced is just an infinite bridge of hell on earth. Brawls rage around us as my knees are starting to buckle, my vision blurring. I\\'m bleeding out of my head onto my girlfriend\\'s lap who is screaming in agony from being carried around with a dislocated knee. I am pretty sure we are going to die. \\n\\nSuddenly I\\'m joined by our savior, a very large goofy looking fellow, who begins helping me carry Emily and encouraging us in French or some other language which we didn\\'t speak. It occurs to me that he could be trying to steal from us too, but at this point I don\\'t even care.  Our new friend\\'s intentions turn out to be true, as he and his group of friends helped me carry my girlfriend to relative safety and helped me guard her while they got help. (For a while I couldn\\'t tell this part of the story without getting extremely emotional about this guy and his friends who stepped up to help us when everyone else was trying to take advantage of our situation. I\\'ll never forget him.)\\n\\nA bunch of paramedics pulled up in a station wagon, urging me to stay calm while they waited for an ambulance. As police pushed rioters further down the bridge in our direction, I begged the paramedics to just get us out of there in the car. With fear in their eyes and the situation escalating they finally relented, carefully placing Emily in the backseat while I jumped in the trunk.\\n\\nThey got us to a safe part of the city and asked us for our ID. It\\'s then we realized that, as if we weren\\'t having a bad day already, **our passports had been stolen.**\\n\\nWe ended up at a hospital outside Paris, where they did a great job re-setting my girlfriend\\'s knee and didn\\'t touch my nose which was fine with me. It\\'s still crooked. Luckily we were able to get emergency passports and continue on the rest of our trip which was absolutely amazing. I still smell tear gas sometimes when I see  Eiffel Tower pictures & trinkets. Good times!\\n\\ntl;dr (again): Was late to the Eiffel tower to watch Euro 2016 finals, ended up in a riot, got tear gassed, girlfriend\\'s knee broken, her phone stolen, my nose broken, and our passports stolen.\\n\\n**EDIT:** Since people are pointing out how I mentioned that the guy who punched me was African, which was for the sole purpose of illustrating the scene, I\\'d like to add that my entire day in Paris was spent hanging out with African guys who showed me more hospitality than I have found almost anywhere else in the world. I hung out with these guys that one day for like 6 hours, they talked to me a lot about just how poor and starving much of the African population in Paris is. I harbored a lot of anger towards the guy that punched me for a while but I also understand the context of just how starving that guy probably was. people that are trying to politicize this, or turn it into some racist/anti-refugee talking point, or are leaving comments like \"those thugs should burn in hell\" should have a more nuanced perception of the world.\\n\\nEDIT2: if the Alt-right folks that are trying to make me their racist champion just because I called the guy African would fuck off, that would be great :)\\n I’m currently in bed, huddled under the covers and riding out the shockwaves of trauma from this event. \\n\\nMy first fuck-up was trying to cut out caffeine a few months ago. I succeeded, but also lost my tolerance for caffeine (was drinking an average of 8 espresso shots throughout the day). \\n\\nToday, maybe two hours ago, I went to a doctors appointment. This appointment was in a huge hospital, one that had a food court and of course, a Starbucks. It was a mental-health related program, so I was a bit on-edge afterwards. I saw the sign for Starbucks and the clouds of depression began to life. Oh hell yes, the sweet nectar of life beckons to me. \\nI get in line and order a medium sized coffee, cream and sugar - something tame, I thought to myself. Not tame enough apparently. \\n\\nI got in the car and started to drive home. About ten minutes away, I feel a bubbling in my gut. Oh boy. It’s fine, I say to myself, I can make it home without incident. Oh, how wrong I was. \\n\\nWhile I had been focused on keeping my asshole clenched, I had forgotten that nearly every road and intersection on my way home was clogged up by construction. Detours everywhere. Every time I thought I was getting close to home, I was forced to backtrack and drive a few streets over. At this point, I’m sweating and shaking, my legs are essentially vibrating, and I have no idea how I haven’t passed out at the wheel yet. \\n\\nAnd then it hits me. The cramps. I got my fucking period. IN THE CAR. \\n\\nAny person with a uterus will tell you how bad cramps are until they are blue in the face. I will do the same, because when I ovulate, I get cysts all over my ovaries due to PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome). Needless to say, it makes everything way more awful than it needs to be. \\n\\nMy abdomen tightens up, trying to force all of the coffee-afterbirth and uterine tissue out of me, but I resist. I will NOT shit my car, and I certainly will not bleed onto my seats. That shit isn’t even paid off yet. \\n\\nI get re-routed for what feels like the millionth time, and finally I see it: a road to home with no construction. I step on the gas and swing around every corner with the gumption and moxie of an F1 driver. In doing this, I have fucked up again. \\n\\nI currently have an inner-ear infection, and in my haste I have shaken up all the liquid in my cochlea. Vertigo. Vertigo like you wouldn’t believe. \\n\\nTo recap: I’m holding in a torrent of liquid regret, clenching my pelvic floor muscles to keep as much of my uterus inside of me as possible, and now I’m dizzy enough that I could no longer tell if my eyes were crossed or not. \\n\\nI fly into my driveway, throw my car in park and yank my keys out. I run to my porcelain throne as fast as my entirely clenched body would allow me, all the while bumping into things in my way because the vertigo hadn’t gone away yet and I was effectively as coordinated as a drunk person. \\n\\nWhen I say it was a photo finish, I’m not joking. I started shitting BEFORE my ass even hit the toilet (everything landed in the bowl tho, thankfully). I was sitting there for, legitimately, nearly 45 minutes. 100% liquid. And it didn’t stop for more than three seconds at a time. Once it was over I felt like I had run a marathon wearing lead boots. All of my energy was gone. I crawled upstairs on my hands and knees with the intent of getting in bed, but had to make a mad dash for the bathroom once again and do it all a second time. Finally got myself in the shower to rinse off all of my sweat and potential residue of my poor choices... and then had to stop mid-shower for a third round of misery. I feel another round coming, so this is probably the end of my post. \\n\\nTL;DR - If you’re drinking coffee and have to drive home immediately after, maybe shit before you leave the coffee shop.\\n\\nEdit: Thank you for the gold, stranger!! I’m glad my story was deemed worthy!\\n\\nEdit 2: Thank you for ANOTHER gold and also platinum!! To answer some questions - yes I am staying hydrated. My mom bought me an absurd amount of Gatorade once she learned of my rectal exorcism. I also did not expect this to gain any attention whatsoever but thank you for the upvotes and kind words :)\\n\\nEdit 3: AND two silver? Damn y’all generous. Me and my burning insides thank you <3\\n\\nEdit 4: Tomorrow there may be a second TIFU in which I gripe about not posting this from my main account. Thank you for all the gold and silver and platinum, readers. I appreciate you!! I’m not feeling quite alright, so my father miiiiight be driving me to the hospital. I’m sure I’m fine but it’s better safe than sorry!!\\n\\nFinal update: I went to my primary care doctor. It’s not IBS, but apparently I am very much lactose intolerant. Makes sense now. Just to clarify, I did not kill the mouse. I own a couple of snakes and they eat frozen mice. About two years ago tho, I got a new hatchling for my collection. A really beautiful animal but I had problems getting her to eat.\\n\\nI contacted the breeder that I got her from and asked what I could try. I was told that some snakes just don\\'t accept dead food so I should try and get the mouse to body temperature.\\n\\nMe being a real smart ass thought the best way to do this was to just put it in the microwave for a couple of seconds. I put the mouse in and selected the lowest setting.\\n\\nAs soon as I hit the start button the mouse exploded. I opened the microwave only to find that the mouse was gone. All I was left with was this slime that coated the whole thing from top to bottom. I have never smelled anything like this.\\n\\nWe now have a new microwave. I learned from my mistake and only heat mice under warm water.\\n\\nUpdate: Yes, she ate. She\\'s currently 2,5 years old and even layed a clutch of eggs last month. :) \\n\\nTl;dr I put a dead mouse in my microwave and it exploded. I bought a new one. So I\\'ve been fooling around with this girl for awhile now and naturally we\\'ve cycled through all your standard vanilla kinks and things were starting to wind down a bit. This wasn\\'t a big deal though as neither of us is interested in anything more than casual sex so there\\'s no pressure to keep things fresh and exciting.\\n\\nThat being said, a little bit ago she randomly messaged me saying she has something naughty to share and sends me cellphone footage of her with a vibrator doing some impressive pornography-grade squirting. She goes on to talk about how excited she is for teaching herself how, and we proceed to make plans to explore this further. Next thing I know she\\'s cumming in my face like a chinese firefighter trying to extinguish a burning chemical factory while I\\'m right there dumping fuel on the flames.\\n\\nNow, before I get carried away here, I\\'ll just say, I\\'m a [M] nurse by trade, and I have no delusions about what\\'s really going on. I can tell exactly where her \\'juices\\' are coming from, and I\\'ve made peace with the fact that the girl is pissing in my face while I go down on her, no big deal.\\n\\nSo finally, to the point. She\\'s been squirting in my face for a few weeks now and I\\'ve gotten enough in my mouth to know how it tastes. The most surprising thing about the experience is the fact that her piss didn\\'t taste at all like I\\'d thought it would. Ranging from unflavored Gatorade to that bland tea they serve you at oriental restaurants (that you dump sugar packets into). I thought it was a fluke at first, but after repeatedly testing this observation, I\\'m quite certain that her piss tastes sweet, sometimes blatantly so.\\n\\nThe perverted side of me thought all this was kinky as hell, so I really didn\\'t think on it too much until this morning. I just woke up and had a weird nurse\\'s epiphany about it. Sweet urine. Glucose urine. Glycosuria. Jesus Christ. I\\'m a fucking dumbass. I race over to my bag where I keep my backup glucometer for work, wake her bleary-eyed ass up, and pricked her finger to check her blood sugar. 441. **Fuck!** Recheck. 453. **Shit!!** Asymptomatic, but hyperglycemic as fuck. She\\'s got the Beetus. Diabetes. I broke the news as gently as I could, which was something to the tune of \"Holy shit fuck! That\\'s some serious fucking diabetes! Call your doctor!\" Hysterics ensued. So now she\\'s out to the doctors office and possibly the urgent care clinic for treatment, and I\\'m sitting here trying figure out a good cover story for how I knew..\\n\\nTLDR; TIFU by breaking some bad news to a girl after she \"squirted\" in my face and I diagnosed her with diabetes after realizing her piss was unnaturally sweet.\\n\\n---------------------------------\\n\\nUPDATE: Insert the obligatory \"omg this went supernova!!1\" .. On a serious note though, thanks for the reddit gold~~en shower~~. This has been a long day and I haven\\'t felt this cool on the Internet since that time I used a voice modulator in an MMORPG to convince my guild I was a black guy.\\n\\nTo bring things current, the girl is doing fine now, they\\'ve ran more thorough tests and strongly suspect she\\'s a type 1 diabetic, but it\\'ll take a few days and tests to confirm the preliminary results. She\\'s got a lot on her mind, all I can think about though is how we went from casual fuck buddies to irreversibly connected by the act of getting her piss in my mouth.\\n\\nStill, the response has been hilariously fantastic. While there\\'s a lot of contention on whether this is a fuck up, I\\'ll just say that a couple factors had stuck out to me personally that framed it like that, such as the fact that it took weeks for me to piece this all together, my majorly panicked reaction to it, and the resulting state of hysteria I had caused after scaring the girl half to death. That all kind of overshadowed the lucky guess I made, in my mind anyway. No longer though! Right now I feel like the fucking **man**, thanks for helping me see the cloud\\'s golden lining! Edit: context as requested: am male. Probably bi tbh. Only ever been with women though. Wife definitely bi. Sorry for omitting\\n\\nThrowaway account because yeah...\\n\\nEssentially the wife and I had just had sex, including the use of her new glass three knobbed butt plug. \\nA fantastic time was had, and we eventually made it into the shower, where we and the plug got cleaned up. \\nI thought it’d be hilarious to pretend to put the plug in myself, and going through with my brilliant plot, picked up the glass plug and attempted to hold it between my butt cheeks. \\n\\nWet glass is slippery. \\n\\nIn less than two seconds, I felt it slip from between my cheeks and turned in time to see it hit the tiled shower floor with a loud CRACK!\\n\\nLuckily it didn’t shatter much, but yeah, pieces of this butt plug ended up all over the shower floor. Wet glass is also pretty much invisible on a wet floor, and inevitably blood was spilled trying to clean up the fragments. \\n\\nAnyways, we cleaned up the glass and after exiting the shower and apologising profusely to my wife, I decided to try to cheer her up. \\n\\nMy solution? Attempt to deepthroat her also new silicon dildo. With a bit of gagging, we learned that apparently I can deepthroat more of the dildo than my wife can, much to her amusement, and eventually managed to take the almost the whole thing like a champ. \\n\\nAnd then promptly threw up from agitating my gag reflex too much. \\n\\nSo yeah, my wife was somewhat sympathetic but then insisted I make an alt and share my shame with reddit. \\n\\nHappy wife = happy life so here I am. \\n\\nTL;DR: Tried to use my wife’s sex toys and broke her buttplug and threw up trying to deepthroat her dildo.\\n\\nEdit: Smashed plug: https://imgur.com/a/5qmM10I\\n\\nEdit 2: well thanks to all of you my wife now has plenty of ideas. Its super late now, so I’m gonna go cry myself to sleep and dread reading in the morning In advance: Something similar happened to someone else who then posted here and that made me post this here also.\\n\\nMy daughter and wife were taking a bath. When we do this, one of us waits in the room next to the bathroom, waiting for the knocking sign of the one bathing with our daughter  to come over and take our child out. this takes about 20 minutes and I thought I take my time and do a little solo round because it\\'s the red time of the month. \\n\\nSo I am in the room next to the bathroom. My girls peacefully taking a bath and i take out my mobilephone and start looking for a good video on pornhub. After I finally found one, it didn\\'t take long and my wife shouted for me, which seemed weird because we normally use the knocking sign. I put my mobilephone aside and went to the bathroom, just to realize they had been listening to the porn i watched cause they were listening to music with a bluetooth speaker connected to my phone.(to make it clear, my Phone provided the music they were listening to, thats why i didn\\'t think about the Bluetooth icon) All i thought was \"how the fuck didn\\'t i realize that there was no sound\".\\n\\nLuckily my daughter is way too young to understand anything of the things she might habe heard and my wife still laughs her ass off. \\n\\n\\n\\nTL;DR Watched porn on my mobilephone, which was connected to a speaker standing in the bathroom, where my wife and daughter were taking a bath.\\n\\n/e: Typo, Grammar, Clarification\\n\\n/e2: im fascinated by the amount of anti-porn people in the comment section. if you dislike something, scroll past it lol. why spend energy to comment on something you dislike? Update: please see update at the bottom of this post. I’m fine.\\n\\nBought bone conduction headphones two weeks ago to wear while running. They sit on your cheekbones and conduct vibration through your bones instead of through your eardrums to reach your cochlea. So you’re hearing music “inside” your head but can still hear all of the ambient sounds of cars, etc. \\n\\nMarketed as a safer solution for runners.\\n\\nWhen I got them in the mail, I was surprised at how quiet my music was with these headphones. I had to turn them up almost ALL THE WAY to get even a half decent volume on my runs.\\n\\nTurns out they were actually LOUD, I just couldn’t hear the music over the ambient sounds of the city. Today I tried plugging my ears and listening to them, and THE MUSIC IS SO LOUD inside my head. Unplug my ears and the perceived volume decreases.\\n\\nSo, the fuck up: I ran for an hour a day for two weeks with full volume music in my head. Without knowing.\\n\\nA few days ago I started noticing sound sensitivity, headache, and ringing in my ears. Yesterday I went for another run with music, and developed a headache part way through. Today I woke up to a splitting headache and piercing high-pitched ringing. It’s lasted all day. \\n\\nThat’s when I realized what must have happened. That’s when I tested my theory with earplugs and the headphones. \\n\\nI’ve had mild tinnitus for my entire life. I’m completely freaked that I may have permanently damaged my ears.\\n\\n\\n\\nTLDR; accidentally listened to music at full volume for two weeks, possibly permanent consequences to my hearing\\n\\nDon’t be like me, kids.\\n\\n\\n——*******UPDATE:*******——\\n\\nGood LORD this took off. I’ve never in my life had a post get this much attention. Talk about a welcome to Reddit experience.\\n\\nI want to emphasize that I am just one person and my experience may be coincidental. Maybe it’s allergies. Maybe it’s a migraine. Maybe the isolation of quarantine is finally getting to me. I have no way of actually scientifically determining that my hearing issue has intensified because of the use of these headphones. It just happened to occur within two weeks of me getting them and beginning daily use. I’m no doctor and I haven’t seen one.\\n\\nI have had mild tinnitus for my entire life. I have no memory of true silence, except when I use that temporary “tap your head” trick. I just feel like the high pitched screaming is lot more noticeable right now, and it’s accompanied by a headache. This could be real, or it could be stress induced and psychological because I’m focusing on it and worried about it.\\n\\nI realize I have thousands of people screaming at me to walk myself right into a specialist’s office RIGHT NOW, but it’s a lot harder when I have to consider my current financial situation. Do you understand how expensive specialists are in the US?\\n\\nI will probably visit Urgent Care and speak with a doctor there, have them check me for sinus or impacted earwax, etc. If they rule out other causes, and advise I get further testing, I will have to decide what my next step is.\\n\\nThank you for every one of you for weighing in with concern, advice, and boner jokes. Really. \\n\\n*****If you are reading this thread and are suffering from a sudden increase of tinnitus, and have the means to see an audiologist or ENT, or even visit Urgent Care, it’s probably a good idea. Remember that people on the internet are not a substitute for trained medical professionals.*****\\n\\n——***UPDATE #2***——\\n\\nThe tinnitus continued to increase to the point I was having trouble hearing or sleeping, so I went to Urgent Care. \\n\\nThey looked in my ears and said, “Wow, yep, you have a lot of fluid built up in there. Probably allergies.” And gave me a steroid and a prescription for allergy medicine.\\n\\n***TL;DR*** I got a shot in my butt and my hearing should return to normal soon. It’s 12:45am as I write this so I suppose I technically FU’d yesterday. \\n\\nI’ve been on tinder for a few weeks. Not 100% what I’m looking for, just seeing what’s out there. About a week ago, I matched with a girl called Meg. She seemed nice, we chatted for a bit, and arranged to go for a drink next week, because of how hectic her shift pattern is.\\n\\nAnyway, Meg messaged me tonight inviting me over, but said she had some friends round as well. I wasn’t keen on going to what sounded like a party when I didn’t know literally anyone there, so I made up and excuse about how I couldn’t go, and said I’d see her next week like we’d planned. \\n\\nA few hours later, I got a notification that I matched with another girl, named Georgia. I tried my luck with a pretty direct first few messages, and it paid off because she invited me over straight away. I had a quick shower, called a taxi and set off over.\\n\\nOn the way there I got a bit more detail. She said she was visiting a friend. When I got to her street, she said she’d meet me outside. She brought her friend with her, just in case I was a murderer or something,\\n\\nI’m sure you can guess who her friend was.\\n\\nShe immediately recognised me. It was the single most awkward moment of my life. To their credit, they took it incredibly well, and invited me in for a beer, which I accepted. \\n\\nI had a pretty nice time for the hour and a half or so that I stuck around, drinking their beer. But I don’t think either of them are gonna be in a rush to see me again.\\n\\nTL;DR - Tried to sleep with two different girls on tinder, turned out they were friends who’re staying in the same flat\\n\\nEDIT - A lot of people are extremely mad that I didn’t have a threesome lol It\\'s one of the outright stupidest fucking things I\\'ve ever done, and hopefully the dumbest shit you\\'ll read today.\\n\\nOk, so a couple of weeks ago, my friend and I were looking to get some dinner, and we decided that red lobster would be good. I don\\'t really watch my diet like I should, and we hadn\\'t been there in about a year, so we placed our order and went to pick it up curbside.\\n\\nOnce we\\'d gotten it, we elected to eat in the car. I got lobster alfredo, and it was delicious. Everything was fine and I went to bed a few hours later.\\n\\nI woke up suddenly at around 3am, struggling desperately to breathe.. I was hacking and choking, wheezing and coughing up thick yellowish liquid; I felt like I was going to die.\\n\\nA tiny light in my mind clicked on.. this feels a lot like when I was in the icu last winter.. \\n\\nA second, dimmer light slowly warmed to a glow.. I was in the icu with atrial fibrillation w/rvr, cardiomyopathy, pulmonary edema, and aspiration pneumonia..\\n\\nAfter a little while, as I got back to where I could breathe somewhat normally again (it still hurt and took a lot of effort), the third tiny light in my mind sputtered to life, and I FINALLY remembered (what should\\'ve been) the most obvious fucking thing all along..\\n\\nI have congestive heart failure. \\n\\nMy lobster alfredo had like 5000mg of sodium in it.\\n\\nSodium is a HUGE no-no for people with heart conditions. \\n\\n\\n\\nTLDR: I totally didn\\'t connect the dots and realize that my meal was exactly what I should not eat because it\\'s loaded with salt and I have a serious heart condition \\n\\n\\nAlso, other than the 3 or so days of chest pain (extremely dangerous) after it happened, I feel pretty normal. i have not been to the cardiologist yet, but I do have an appointment coming up. (They take forever to get, this will be my 3rd in like 7 months and the last one was only a phone call)\\n\\nEdit: Those with knowledge tell me that the S doesn\\'t mean that it\\'s a small fuckup, it means it\\'s a short post.\\n\\nEdit2: Thank you all for your kind and terrible words!\\n\\nEdit3: Red Lobster is an american chain seafood restaurant.\\n\\nEdit 4: rBangerz YT has my consent to make a video involving this story So, I like to think i\\'m an O.K mom. I don\\'t smother my son or let him get too crazy. He\\'s fifteen so I always knock on the door, not just to be respectful, but because there\\'s some things a mom shouldn\\'t see.\\n\\nWell, yesterday he left to go to the McDonald\\'s across the street with some friends. I assumed he\\'d be a couple hours so as far as I knew I was alone. I decided to take advantage by putting on some headphones that wouldn\\'t be inevitably tugged on with a \"Mom, can-\" question following.\\n\\nI\\'m doing the dishes, sweeping, trash, etc while Metallica is blasting in my ears. I start gathering laundry/putting it away, and unbeknownst to me my son got home earlier than expected.\\n\\nI decided to toss his gym clothes I just finished washing on his bed while I was putting away my own clothes as our rooms are right next to each other. I DID NOT KNOW HE WAS HOME. I walk straight in without knocking and I\\'m horrified.\\n\\nMy 15 y/o son is...shoving a spoon down his throat and gagging over a cereal bowl. What the fuck.\\n\\nHe instantly jumps, slowly turns over to me, and the spoon almost comically drops from his mouth. I set the clothes down and in my confusion/horror sit down next to him.\\n\\nI asked \"What were you doing?\" and he\\'s extremely nervous and keeps repeating \"it\\'s nothing i wasn\\'t doing anything.\"\\n\\nHe\\'s on the wrestling team and it clicked in my head *oh shit he was making himself throw up he must be body conscious how did i not notice he was doing this to himself*. \\n\\nI start giving a mom speech about how body dysphoria is extremely common in teens and he shouldn\\'t be afraid to ask for help from a trusted adult, that i\\'m here for him, he\\'s perfect just the way he is. \\n\\nHe looks like a deer caught in the headlights and remains adamant he wasn\\'t doing anything. I asked \"Is this something you\\'d rather talk about with (uncle) or (coach)?\" He\\'s exasperated and tense saying there\\'s nothing to talk about.\\n\\nFinally I just have to say \"It\\'s pretty obvious what you were doing and I need you to be honest with me or someone else so we can figure this out.\"\\n\\nHim: \"I wasn\\'t trying to throw up!\"\\n\\nMe: \"Then what were you doing?\"\\n\\nHim: \"I needed to know if I have a gag reflex!\"\\n\\nI\\'m extremely confused at this point and ask why. He blurts, \"I\\'m gay!\" I\\'m completely shocked and he has tears in his eyes.\\n\\nIt clicks.\\n\\nI immediately wish I hadn\\'t done laundry that day and give a quick \"I\\'m sorry, it\\'s okay, I support you completely, I\\'ll just...leave you to that\" and continue doing chores.\\n\\nDinner rolls around and he\\'s refusing to make eye contact but eventually we ease into a conversation about how he\\'s been hiding it for awhile, has a lot of homophobic friends and was ashamed to tell me because \"I\\'m your only son so you wouldn\\'t have grandkids\". He planned to come out in college. I had no idea he thought I\\'d react that way and assured him I\\'d love him no matter what.\\n\\nApparently he\\'s also not planning on...doing anything he\\'d need to practice with a spoon for in the near future...but was just curious and wanted to be ready. I\\'m relieved but mostly want to forget I ever saw that. At least it brought us closer.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR walked in on son gagging himself with a spoon. thought it was bulimia. turns out hes just gay.  \\n\\nThis happened today morning and I am still thinking how to process it. This is gonna be a long rant.\\n\\nI have another account that I use professionally so this is a throwaway.\\n\\nGoing for a stressful period in life and so I often hang out with my cousin and we too are really close in a sibling way. So, coming to today I live in 2 rooms on the first floor - an old room where everything from my previous flat is stocked and is more of a store room and the other is where I work and live 24x7. I woke up early to try clean my old store room and was rummaging through some old dvds and stuff.Also made double sure I had the condoms hidden away in a box and whilst doing so, a client who had been avoiding paying me called - I dropped everything and got into the call which ended with me throwing away my phone and the tempered glass cracks. No worries, I got another one- meanwhile cousin was laughing away hysterically at me. I was trying to get the new temper on and realized I need to wipe it, given how lazy I am I asked her to go get some wet wipes from the other room and told her which box had it. She went and disappeared for nearly half an hour. Given, how absent minded she can be I did not think anything of it and kept the phone aside for now.\\n\\nLater, she comes to the room with a very serious look, somewhat teary eyes and asked me if I really wanted this ? I said \"Yes, I have been waiting forever for this\" and I mimicked her serious tone just for kicks. Next thing I know she has jumped on top of me and is kissing me - not the brotherly kiss btw and I sat there all frozen and for some reason I did not move a muscle to throw her off me. I just froze. she starts stripping and i said something like why/how...its a bit foggy there. She says see saw the strawberry condoms, the adele dvd and the old box had this Pretty please designed on it. strawberry is her favourite and adele is her weakness. So, my poor cousin struggled with the moral dilemma for a good 30 minutes before coming to me to ask me and I stupidly said yes. I put the condoms instead of the wet wipes (both have some bluish covers) That stupid adele album is here favourite.\\n\\nThankfully, before she could disrobe and this went any further, we heard my mother shouting from below that lunch is ready. I quickly made my exit without blinking for a second and had my lunch without choking myself. Mom dragged my cousin to the market for some shopping and my cousin told me with great sadness in her voice \"I am there for you\"\\n\\nI am writing this now knowing I might have messed up my relationship with her forever.\\n\\nI know I will tell her the truth when she comes back but such a series of coincidences is too hard to be believed\\n\\nTL;DR : Sent cousin to get wet wipes, had mixed up old stuff earlier, gave her all the signals that I wanted to hookup with her and she agreed. Kill me now someone pls. A friend knocked on my door today. I don\\'t know him too well, he\\'s the father of one of my son\\'s friends. He seemed quite urgent, so I let him in. He asked if I had a scanner, as he needed something scanned and emailed to him straight away. I sure did!\\n\\nI invited him into my office. Placed the first page into the scanner. Sat down. Opened my graphics software, and declared \"It\\'s easy! Watch!\".\\n\\nUnfortunately the software displayed the last image I was working on; a close-up of my erect penis.\\n\\nIt was a decent photo actually. Great lighting. Good composition. A nice angle, too! I don\\'t HAVE many of those pics, I just took one recently as someone asked for it, and uncharacteristically, I felt like obliging.\\n\\nTwo thoughts went through my head;\\n\\n1. CLOSE IT (which I did)\\n2. Will he think I\\'ve been checking out dick pics, and that I\\'m gay?!\\n\\nNow, #2 is not an issue. I am not, and I don\\'t care if anyone thinks I am. However... recently he\\'s been inviting me to a lot of kids\\' events, and asking questions like \"are you dating?\", \"what do you think of Helen?\" (name changed for privacy reasons). So I\\'ve been wondering if HE is that way inclined, and perhaps had his eyes on me....\\n\\nSo... I then compounded things.\\n\\nTo stop him thinking that I\\'d been looking a close-up pics of other men\\'s penises.. I confidently said \"That was me!\".\\n\\nHe looked around, said \"I think someone called me\", and left.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT: There have been a lot of questions! So here are some clarifications;\\n\\n1. I didn\\'t scan my penis. I scanned his paper documents.\\n2. I took the photo of myself with a DSLR+tripod\\n3. The photo editing I did on the photo of myself was limited to cropping (removing background stuff) and resizing the image itself (from \\\\~4000px to \\\\~2000px).\\n4. All 3 people mentioned in this story are single. We all live in the same townhouse complex.\\n5. The software I use (paint.net) is used both for the editing (cropping, resize) and for acquiring images from my flatbad scanner\\n6. No, unless we have a pre-existing relationship, you can\\'t see the photo. Thanks for asking, though!\\n7. This happened at my home office. \\n\\nTL;DR accidentally showed a neighbour a close-up photo of my erect penis, then proudly said \"that was me!\" So my toddler was hungry, I was in the middle of making dinner (that she probably wouldn’t eat anyway) so I gave her some popcorn and cut up an apple for her, then returned to the kitchen to finish dinner. \\n\\nEverything seemed fine until she was about to go to bed for the night, when she just started crying and pointing at her nose. I shined my flashlight up there and she had shoved a god damn popcorn kernel up her nose. It was obvious that tweezers would only make it worse so I took her to the ER in our town. \\n\\nThe whole hospital staff thought it was pretty funny. The doctor came in and told me the popcorn kernel removal procedure is something called “the mothers kiss” and told me how to do it. I had to hold down her clear nostril, lock my mouth over hers and blow hard into her mouth. I did this and the popcorn kernel came shooting out like a fucking snot covered bullet and ricocheted around the room. We never found its landing place, we were all just happy it was out, even if I was covered in boogers. \\n\\nTLDR: My 3 year old thought it would be fun to put a popcorn kernel in her nose when I wasn’t looking. Google “the mothers kiss”. This happened a couple months ago, but I ran into my former boss today and she informed me that she still watches the video footage of my fuck up whenever she needs a good laugh. \\n\\nFor the past five years I’ve worked in childcare with primarily one and two year olds. I’m very affectionate and am known to spoil the kids by holding them and cuddling them all day. I often have multiple toddlers coming to me needing to be consoled at the same time so I’ve gotten very good at multitasking. \\n\\nOne day, this little boy named Luke was getting picked up by his dad early. It was snack time and Luke was not happy about having to leave and have his snack taken away from him. I took the screaming Luke and set him on the edge of the half door counter thing in front of his dad. His dad put an arm around him and bent over to sign him out. \\n\\nLuke was still crying loudly so I reached out my hand to smooth his hair back and touch his cheek. At the same time as I’m doing this, another little boy starts crying my name because he’s just fallen down, so I turn around a little bit to face the other child. At this point, I’m still caressing Luke’s face almost subconsciously while also kneeling down to talk to the other boy that’s crying. \\n\\nAfter several moments of touching Luke’s face, I realize that it’s surprisingly hairy and then realize that he’s a baby and shouldn’t have a hairy face. My hand freezes and I slowly turn my head to see that not only am I face to face with Luke’s dad (because I was kneeling and he was bent over the door signing Luke out) but that I also have my hand on his face instead of Luke’s. \\n\\nI sat there shocked for several seconds before I realized that he had the biggest grin on his face and it finally clicked in my brain that I should move my hand. I stood up and immediately started apologizing and trying to explain myself. He just chuckled and said, “Don’t be. Your hands are very soft and I do enjoy being pet.” \\n\\nThe thing about Luke’s dad is that he is one of the most stunningly beautiful men to walk this earth. All the women I worked with had crushes on him and I’m pretty sure he knew it. He’s also very charming and sometimes flirty, but not in a creepy inappropriate way. \\n\\nSo when he said this to me, my jaw dropped and my face felt like it was about to burst into flames from how much I was blushing. He saw my face, let out a big belly laugh, and said, “Relax. I’m just messing with you. It’s ok, really.” He then winked at me before chuckling some more and leaving with Luke. \\n\\nA couple minutes later, I hear some roaring laughter coming from the Directors office. My Director came down the hall cackling and asking who wanted to see me make a move on Luke’s dad. Of course, by the end of the day everyone had seen the video of my fuck up. \\n\\nThe next day, Luke’s mom came into the room and said, “I heard you made a move on my husband yesterday” and then erupted into laughter. Apparently he called her as soon as he left to tell her all about what I had done. When my director saw that Luke’s mom was there, she called us into her office to watch the video together. It’s even more embarrassing watching it happen because of how absurdly long I was touching his face. Luckily, Luke’s mom found the whole thing hilarious and hugged me and laughed the whole time we watched the video. \\n\\nThe rest of the time I worked there I was teased about what I’d done. And apparently my Director still watches the video and even shows some of the new employees. It is quite funny now  but was super embarrassing in the moment. \\n\\nTL;DR- I accidentally caressed the dad of one of the children in my class and am now known as the teacher who “made a move” on a parent. This happened around 2010 when I was roughly 24 years old. I still lived at home with my Mom who always had a sweet tooth. Now, by this time she was suffering from some early onset dementia and did not work, so she had a lot of time on her hands. She liked to call customer service numbers and give them a hard time about little things for some human interaction, in my opinion. She had been calling Nabisco several times about her opening brand new Oreo packages and finding the center row of the tray  almost completely devoid of Oreos. I knew this because she had mentioned it and would leave notes from her phone calls around. I rolled my eyes as I was used to her being a little nutty. According to her, it kept happening and she began taking photos of the Oreos each time it happened to try to prove to Nabisco that she wasn\\'t making this up. I assumed she was eating them and forgetting.  One day, I\\'m in the kitchen and I open up a brand new package of Oreos and grab several from the center row.  As I start walking away, it hit finally hit me! She didn\\'t realize that Oreo had updated their packaging to having the Easy Open Pull Tab on the top! She was still opening the side of the package and sliding the tray out. I was the Oreo thief the whole time and didn\\'t know it! We had a good laugh over it. My Mom died shortly thereafter in January 2012 and my sister bought me an Oreo Christmas ornament. I smile as I recall the Oreo Incident when I decorate my tree each year. \\n\\nTL;DR - I was using the new Easy Open Pull Tab on the top of Oreo packages while my mom was still opening the package from the side and sliding the tray out which led to her thinking Nabisco was shorting us Oreos. I was using a Bluetooth adapter in my car to be safe and not use my phone while driving. I asked Siri to play a song called “make me wanna die” and to my surprise, instead of playing the song she said something along the lines of “ if you’re feeling depressed the suicide hotline can help you, would you like me to call?” I screamed “ NO DO NOT DO THAT” soooo of course she did anyway. I didn’t want to hang up because idk what happens if you hang up on the suicide hotline? So some lady who had much more important stuff to do answered and I low key yelled “IMFINESIRIGOTCONFUSEDIMSOSORRY” based on her reaction it wasn’t he first time it’d happened but I was still totally mortified. \\n\\ntldr: I asked Siri to play a song and she called the suicide hotline instead This happened around 5 years ago when I was still in university. \\n\\nI was not the most forthcoming 5 years ago, I didn\\'t know how to \\'be\\' around women, let alone, god forbid, have sex with said women. \\n\\nAs surprising as it may seem then, I was going through quite the \\'dry spell\\' that year, and had resigned myself to studying instead and little else. \\n\\nHowever, as with all things in life, the moment you stop you looking is the moment you find it. \\n\\nI found myself back at this girl\\'s house who was studying in the UK for that year. She was from Slovenia (somewhat unimportant detail other than those Brits who voted \\'Leave\\' and now see me as part of the EU problem somehow) and absolutely gorgeous. I was punching way, way above my weight and thought I should relish every one of the seconds I knew I was going to enjoy with this girl. \\n\\nAgain, unsurprisingly, I did not quite go the distance. I was however, in a state of absolute delirium - that post-orgasm \\'fuzz\\' where everything in the world seems grand, and nothing could take that away.\\n\\nApart from me, of course. \\n\\nShe, rightly so, tried to, y\\'know, get me going again, for my first attempt was so poor. \\n\\nHowever, in my state of delirium, and ultimately recovery, I was in no fit state to do so just yet. \\n\\nAs she goes to sit atop of me, my brain goes into a strange autopilot. \\n\\nI gently push her to the side to stop her sitting down on me. Ok, that\\'s bad enough, but it didn\\'t stop there.\\n\\nI, for entirely unknown reasons say the words \\'That\\'ll do pig, that\\'ll do\\'. In exactly the same way as that immortal final line from the kid\\'s movie called \\'Babe\\' (about a pig, funnily enough). \\n\\nAs it transpires, this movie was not a hit in Slovenia, and no amount of me pleading \\'IT\\'S A KID\\'S MOVIE\\' at her seemed to help as she slowly got dressed and opened the door for me. \\n\\nTLDR: Ended a dry spell with a knockout girl, refused round two by calling her a farmyard animal.\\n\\nEdit 1 - thanks for the Gold. You\\'ve taken my gold virginity, in fact. That\\'ll do, pig, that\\'ll do. \\n\\nEdit 2 - to all those all knowing sex gods on Reddit telling me that sex doesn\\'t end at the male orgasm. Yeah, thanks guys, I know. I was in a state of bewilderment. I just needed a moment. I had plans. But then I fucked up. Hence why it\\'s here on TIFU. Who woulda thought it or thunk it? So today I woke up at 5 a.m. (about an hour ago). I open reddit before I start getting ready for work. I notice a TIFU [post. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/c4i94n/tifu_by_explaining_my_synesthesia_to_my_boyfriend/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) It has a lot of upvotes, so I figure it must be a good one.  \\n\\nAs I’m reading through the post and comments, I realize that have never been able to visualize something or someone. I only see black.  I did not realize that this is not normal. Apparently it’s called aphantasia and it’s relatively rare. Most people see clear images and colors when they’re visualizing something. I’m 22 and did not know this was a thing until I read that post.  I’ve been trying to test myself for the last hour to see if I can “picture” anything. Turns out I can’t. So now I’m sitting here having an existential crisis about all the things I’ll never be able to “see” again.  \\n\\nTL;DR I read a reddit post and discovered I have aphantasia.\\n\\n\\nEDIT: a lot of people are asking if I can dream or not.  The answer is sort of.  I do have dreams occasionally and supplements (melatonin/other sleep pills) sometimes make them more vivid, but I don’t recall them at all. The only time I know I have dreamt is when it’s a shocking/scary/exciting dream. I feel something after I wake up, I just can’t recall a damn thing that happened. Sometimes I can remember the premise of the dream, like if it was me working or traveling somewhere, just can’t “see” what I saw when I dreamt.  I think I dream maybe once or twice a month.\\n\\nEDIT 2:  I understand the difference between visualizing and actually seeing something. *seeing* is just the best word I have to describe what I can’t do in my head.  From memory, I can tell you what something looks like. I just can’t *see* it in my minds eye.   \\n\\nWhile reading a book, the descriptions do nothing for me.  I read for the plot. My husband and I adopted my parent\\'s parrot this spring after my dad passed away and my mom moved into assisted living. We got a backpack carrier for him last month so we can visit and my mom can still see him (the parrot, not my dad).\\n\\nSince we have the backpack, we decided to take him for nature walks instead of always keeping him in the house. For now we\\'re putting the backpack in a baby stroller so it\\'s less of a jarring bumpy ride until he gets used to standing on a moving perch. It\\'s got screen mesh on three sides so he can see out, but it\\'s a little hard to see into his pack from more than a foot or two away. It just looks like we\\'re pushing a stroller with a large backpack in it.\\n\\nSo yesterday we went on our first walk in a local park. The bird\\'s quiet, or calmly chirping, or occasionally saying \"Hello, youuuuuuu\" and we respond back in kind, a call and response thing he likes.\\n\\nThe park\\'s mostly deserted - until the local high school track team runs by for their after-school practice run through the park. A bunch of teenage boys, shirtless. And one lags behind. As the lone boy, maybe 15 years old, runs past us, the bird calls out the loudest wolf whistle ever. And my husband and I burst out laughing, as the boy runs away from us faster.\\n\\nEdit because of photo requests: \\n[Bongo in his backpack](https://i.imgur.com/Ju2VLVI.jpg)\\n\\n[parrot in stroller](https://i.imgur.com/egNdLN2.jpg)\\n\\nEdit 2: a few people are asking about the backpack. The one I have is a \"pak-o-bird\" from celltei.\\n\\nEdit 3: I stopped by the high school front office, with the parrot in the backpack as proof, and dropped off this letter: \\n\\nMay 7, 2019\\n\\nAn open letter of apology to the track coach and team at Stevenson High,\\n\\nYesterday I went for a walk in the woods at Dodge Park when members of what I believe were your track team went running by me. One of the team members was lagging behind, and I inappropriately chose that moment to let out the loudest wolf whistle possible.\\n\\nAt the time I was sitting in my backpack carrier in a stroller, being pushed by my owners. They broke out in loud laughter. The person I whistled at probably didn’t see me and thought my owners whistled at me to sexually harass me, and then were laughing loudly about it because they were jerks. That’s not what happened, and while they didn’t need to laugh, the whole incident was entirely my fault. I was acting inappropriately.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nBongo, a poorly behaved parrot who needs to learn boundaries.\\n\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: Our hidden parrot sexually harassed a young shirtless boy and made my husband and I look like pedophile bullying assholes. This story actually took place around this time last year, but because it\\'s embarrassing nature, my coworkers haven\\'t stopped reminding me about it. \\n\\nOur office does a small secret Santa goft exchange every year, that we typically arrange in November, and give out gifts in December. You write your name on a slip of paper, along with some gift ideas, and whoever gets your name generally gets you some kind of gift, without you knowing who got it for you. The budget for these gifts is $20, so it\\'s not like anyone is getting something super fancy.\\n\\nNow, generally speaking, I\\'m pretty indecisive. Ask me what I want for Christmas, I\\'ll probably say I don\\'t know. Ask me what I want within a $20 budget? I definitely have no idea. I remember writing on the slip \"IDK, something cool?\" beneath my name, expecting to maybe get a gift card or something generic. \\n\\nWhen I get to my desk on the day of gift exchange, I see a can of Coke with an image of Santa on the can, sitting beside a card. I remember thinking to myself \"Well, this is what I get for not being specific. May as well be appreciative of what I\\'ve been given.\" \\n\\nI open up the card, which contains an cheesy line, fitting of the sense of humor of the people in my office. \"If you put me in the fridge, I make a \"cool\" gift!\" My eyes scan down the card, and I read the next line. \"P.S. I\\'m almost twice your age!\" Now, this should have been my first clue. However, being the youngest person at my office (I\\'m 20), I took this line to be a clue as to who my secret Santa was! After all, half the fun was trying to figure out who got you the gift. Never in a million years would I have thought that line, was to be taken from the perspective of the can. \\n\\nSo, I crack open the can. As I go to take a sip, I notice the metal on the outside smells off. I\\'m not sure how to describe the smell, aside from how one might imagine an old garage would smell. This should have been my second clue, but instead I picture someone keeping their soda in a second fridge in their garage, something I had known many of my friend\\'s fathers to do. Of course, these were sodas we weren\\'t allowed to drink, so I rationalize to myself that this particular can perhaps sat in a fridge in someone\\'s garage long enough to soak of some of the, erm, garage smell? After a moment of hesitance, I remember once more that I should be appreciative of the gift, and take a sip. \\n\\nNow, it feels important to note here, that I don\\'t really drink Coke. If anything, I drink Pepsi, but I\\'m not really the biggest fan of dark sodas. I\\'m generally a Sprite or even Mountain Dew kind of guy. The first sip, as far as I\\'m concerned, didn\\'t really set off any alarm bells. Maybe I was just in denial, but it wasnt until a few sips in that I truly became aware the soda was... Off. I think to myself that it\\'s the odd garage smell of the can that\\'s got the soda tasting strange, as smell is a big part of taste, right? So, deciding I don\\'t want to offend whoever it was that gave me the gift, I chug down the rest of the can as quickly as possible. \\n\\nNow, it isn\\'t until about an hour later that one of my supervisors approaches me, presumably for something unrelated, and looks in absolute horror at the can on my desk. I\\'m confused of course, until they explain that they collect Coke memorabilia, including some of the older unopened cans with specific designs. They point out the PS on the card that was, apparently meant to indicate the age of the can and not the age of the person... I try to laugh it off, but, the judgement in the eyes of my supervisor is clear. After googling around, I managed to find the exact Santa can. If I recall correctly, it had been about 35 years old, give or take a year.\\n\\nThe bright side is, surprisingly, the soda didn\\'t make me sick at all. The downside is, even a year after the fact, I have yet to live this down. Everyone in the office knows I drank this ancient soda, and even our new hires are quickly filled in. I wouldn\\'t say it\\'s what I\\'m known for at the office, but it\\'s definitely still present in the minds of my coworkers!\\n\\nTLDR; someone gave me a collectible can of coke for secret Santa, and not wanting to be impolite at the odd gift of a soda, I drank it. My roommate and I are pretty close and have an open policy about going into each others\\' \"bedside drawers\" (need condoms, lube, etc.) As far as I know, neither of us has used this liberty until now. My roommate is out of town for a few weeks for a marathon and vacation and I am kind of lazy when it comes to certain things. \\n\\nDue to improper planning, I ran out of personal lubricant so I took a visit to my roommate\\'s drawer to see if he had some. He did, as well as some other things. One of those things was what I can only describe as a [triple cock-ring] (https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/3178JrK6a1L._SY355_.jpg) contraption.\\nFor context, my roommate is a 6\\'2 black guy and I\\'m a 5\\'10 ginger. Naturally, I assumed that, if anything, this device would be too big for me. I was woefully wrong.\\n\\nI was in the mood so I didn\\'t think through the possible consequences of placing my most precious parts in this stainless steel death trap. Almost immediately after wriggling my naughty bits into this thing, I realized my horrible mistake. \\n\\nWithin 30 seconds, my twig and berries transformed into a grotesque set of eggplant and plums. As with any bad situation, I figured my best way out was to power through. I took the aforementioned lube and went to town.\\n\\nAfter what felt like a lifetime, I began to approach climax. For my trouble, I was hoping for an intensely pleasurable orgasm. Again, I was wrong. \\n\\nInstead of a powerful release, I was met with an intense pain in my perineum and nothing came out. This thing was so tight that there was NO ejaculate. I freaked out.\\n\\nI figured once I got this nonsense torture device off my situation, things would resolve themselves but again, I was wrong.\\n\\nThe caricature emoji that was my junk, remained fully engorged.\\nI continued to freak out. I didn\\'t want to go to the ER and have some firefighter saw this horrifying mistake off my adult parts, so I did the next logical thing. \\n\\nI filled a bowl with ice and water, dunked my bits and hoped for salvation. After 15 minutes, the swelling subsided to the point that I could manipulate the affected area out of the contraption.\\nAfter another 20 minutes of icing my genitals, I went to relieve myself and proceeded to pass, what I assumed to be, a frothy mixture of man milk and urine.\\n\\n2/10 Do not try.\\n\\nTL;DR: Use a flexible cock ring, and don\\'t be racist obligatory this was a few months ago disclaimer\\n\\nthis story starts as all tragedies do, with a heartbreaking moment - I was playing a game on my phone and accidentally dropped it behind the couch. very frustrating but not a big deal, i’ll just grab it from behind the couch, right? oh no, I was so so wrong. I reach behind to couch, and i’m pretty short, so i’m sort of just swinging my arm around hoping to make contact with my phone. suddenly, my arm catches on the back frame of the couch between the couch and the wall; specifically, the side button on my apple watch got stuck. \\n\\nfor those that don’t know, the apple watch has an emergency sos function. if you hold down the side button for a few seconds it’ll bring up the emergency screen. then, it starts a 5 second countdown before calling 911. it makes a siren noise and starts vibrating pretty aggressively, then announces that it is calling 911. I heard the siren, but didn’t register what was happening until I heard the announcement. I suddenly am hit with a rush of adrenaline and yank my arm out of the couch frame trap. however, it was too late. the dispatcher was on and i’m screaming at both her and the watch that “i’m ok, please don’t worry I am ok!!! no, I don’t need help or an officer, i’m really really fine!!!” however, i’m informed that an officer has to come out and check just to be sure. \\n\\nthere are about 15 cops who live in my neighborhood, so the officer who shows up was actually one of my neighbors who I had seen in passing. I open the door, very red and pretty out of breath. he says, “ma’am, are you okay? we received an emergency call from this location” and I have to bow my head and explain to him that yes, I am fine, I just got my arm stuck behind the couch and the apple watch called 911 for me. at first, he just stares, and he’s kind of confused. but then his lips twitch and I see that he was doing his best not to laugh. he explains that people accidentally calling 911 on their apple watches is pretty common, but he’s never directly experienced it, and that this is one of the funniest moments of his career. fortunately he is a very nice guy, but now every time I see him around the neighborhood he says “hey, apple watch!”\\n\\ntldr; dropped my phone behind the couch &amp;amp;amp; accidentally called 911\\n\\nediting to add:\\n1- wow this blew up! sorry I was on a plane all day and just now checking back on it and it went from 16 upvotes to over 10k\\n\\n2- thanks for the award random kind stranger!\\n\\n3- I know I should have been more calm and it would probably not have been such a big deal, but I live in a state where if they get a call, they have to send someone out no matter what. also, I have only called 911 once for a bad car accident I was in, and I think it was drilled in my head so much as a child to never call 911 unless it’s a “true emergency” and that’s why I freaked out. but noted, next time i get my arm stuck behind the couch and accidentally call 911, I will remain calm and explain the situation to the operator. \\n\\n4- i’m really loving reading everyone’s accidental 911 stories, please keep ‘em coming! \\n\\n5- thanks for not judging me :-) So this morning I smoked a joint then went to the store with the intention of only getting a couple things. As I walked through the store though, I started to get a little paranoid about the virus. With me touching the cart handle, seeing people in masks, plexiglass in front of the cashiers, announcements over the speakers to maintain distance from people.. So I started stocking my cart up with produce, cans, and frozen food.\\n\\nThen when I\\'m approaching the cashier I suddenly remember that I fuckin walked there and that\\'s why I was only going to get a few things. And since i was already approaching her and made eye contact there was no turning back. So I carried a shit ton of bags of cans and frozen meat to the house a little over a mile away, my shoulders still hurt. Oh and it started drizzling on my way home. \\n\\nTLDR: got paranoid about coronavirus and stocked up on heavy food, forgetting I had to walk home. Brief summary:\\n\\nI was recently prescribed an amphetamine medication. I took some and expected the typical described results. What I did not expect was to experience a sharply increased sex drive coupled with an unfortunate effect of impotence - however this would not deter me from my goal of achieving sweet release. I was on a mission to give my brain what it wanted, apparently at any cost, and my rocksteady mental fortitude was nothing short of a fully loaded freight train without brakes.  \\n\\nTen minutes of sweet loving turned into half an hour in the blink of an eye. Confused, yet dedicated, I proceeded onward. The next glance at the clock revealed that three hours had gone by. \"How could this be happening?\", I thought, but I was far too invested at this point to give up. The next three hours went by as quickly and autonomously as the last, but after a total of six hours, the deed was done, and the ensuing moment of clarity was a grim moment indeed as I considered the consequences of my actions.  \\n\\nMy little man has receded mostly into my body and is now simply a swollen nub which stands stoutly as a monument to man\\'s arrogance. Also, the entire member feels harshly chafed and my entire pelvic region is sore. I\\'m not looking forward to the next 24 hours.  \\n\\n**AFTERMATH: WARNING NSFW(no blood)**\\n\\n[Album of what once resembled a fairly normal penis.](http://imgur.com/a/msz2i)\\n\\nI\\'m anticipating a few questions so I will address them here:\\n\\n* Were you ever erect?\\n     * I achieved at most half-chub intermittently for less than 50% of the entire session.\\n* Did you finish? \\n     * Yes\\n* Was it worth it?\\n     * Absolutely not\\n* Did you use any lube?\\n     * No\\n* Does it hurt?\\n     * Terribly\\n* Why did you do it?\\n     * Because apparently I have no self respect.\\n\\nTL;DR: Got high and beat my dick like it owed me money for six consecutive hours - excruciating pain and shame ensued.  \\n\\nSo like every other post this didn\\'t happen today and this story will be kept as vague as possible while still telling the story because I don\\'t want people to find out who i am lol..\\n\\nIn order to understand why this all happened I have to explain that I was in high school and was dating a girl we will call Samantha, well when I started dating Samantha I was friends with her sister Joselyn beforehand and it turns out that Joselyn had a thing for me that I was oblivious to. Anyways I thought she had gotten over it as me and Samantha had been dating for over 2 years already and there never seemed to be any sort of bad blood between the three of us. This is where the fuck up happened.. One day in school my girlfriend and I decided to skip class and were walking in the halls when we saw that a teacher had left their room open (Without going too much into detail this teacher had the biggest room due to the type of class they taught.) so we decided to go in there to skip class and being horny teenagers we started doing more than just talking and hanging out... After that Samantha decides to tell Joselyn what we did because it was super crazy and full of adrenaline... This is how I found out that Joselyn was still holding resentment after all this time. She told her parents about what Samantha and I did in that classroom and her parents called the school which lead to an investigation on the teacher to see if he was leaving his door unlocked on purpose to allow the students to go in there and do as they please, the whole investigation put a strain on an already weak marriage the teacher was in which lead to a divorce and the teacher was found \"At fault\" for not locking his door and condoning this behavior so he was forced to resign and basically the teacher wont be allowed to teach again in our district.. the teacher is now working at a local grocery store baking cookies and basically I will always remember this shit as I feel AWFUL and dont know what to do or fix it.\\n\\nTL;DR - Had sex in a teachers classroom which lead to the teacher having a divorce, and being forced to resign.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nP.S formatting is trash because I wrote this on phone sorry.\\n\\n&#x200B; Hi all, \\n\\nMade myself a Reddit account just so I could share this story with you all.\\n\\nThis happened back when I was in 5th grade, but remains a great story to this day. My father was a general contractor, and I would occasionally tag along and \"help\" him work by basically doing all the jobs that he didn\\'t want to do. One such job was to remove a large amount of poison ivy from a fence at a client\\'s house. He gave me gloves and other such protective equipment and firmly instructed me not to get any of the poison ivy on my skin. \\n\\nShocker: I got the poison ivy on my skin. A lot of it.\\n\\nFor weeks I was covered in poison ivy, head to toe, and constantly scratching. The fun part is that head to toe included my 5th grade dick and balls. I eventually found out that itching down there felt good. Really good. Much better than itching anywhere else on my body. One day, after several minutes of itching in the bathroom of my tiny little weiner, I started to feel exceptionally good, and eventually some sticky goo came out. It\\'s important to note that at this point, I had not yet had sex ed, nor had my parents really instructed me on anything in that realm. So I thoroughly indulged for weeks of this new found pleasure. \\n\\nEventually (this is where it gets good) my poison ivy went away. My smart little 5th grade mind figured that I couldn\\'t feel good on my trouser snake like that without the poison ivy. Lucky for me, my family lived deep in the woods. \\n\\nDesperate to get that feeling back, I wandered out in the woods and found myself some poison ivy. I snuck it back in the house and locked myself in the bathroom (I didn\\'t know what I was doing, but somehow knew to be ashamed) and proceeded to rub it ALL OVER my family jewels.   \\n\\n\\nWhen I had gotten it before it wasn\\'t through direct contact, so after a couple of days, my sensitive skin swelled to the point of blisters. Blisters. On my 5th grade schlong. It cracked and bled so much that I actually didn\\'t even want to touch it, regardless of how good it felt. Agony for weeks and I didn\\'t even have the opportunity to enjoy it. \\n\\nA couple of months later, I was reading my bible (my parents were missionaries and this was a common occurrence, not because of my shame for what I had done) and I came across a passage that said something along the lines of \"then so-and-so spilled his semen\". I didn\\'t know what semen was, much less what spilling it meant, so I asked my dad and he explained. That\\'s when it clicked on what I had done.\\n\\nTL;DR: I intentionally gave myself an allergic reaction to poison ivy in order to masturbate. Throwaway for obvious reasons.\\n\\nHoly fuck I can\\'t believe i\\'m writing this.\\n\\nTo give you some context, my mom used to be an adult actress. She has been pretty open about it in the past, and my family doesn’t really judge her for it. She stopped about 5 years ago after she got pregnant with my sister and hasn’t looked back.\\n\\nToday I was doing the five knuckle shuffle to one of those compilations (I don’t want to be judged, so I won’t say any more). You can probably see where this is going. Just as I was about to bust a nut, it cut to an old video of my mom. I could definitely tell it was her because she looked directly at the camera for a second, but the machine was already in motion. I tried everything I could but it was too late.\\n\\nLater on I went downstairs to watch TV and I couldn’t even look at my mom. This is definitely gonna be an awkward few months. One thing’s for sure, from now on I think I’ll just use my imagination.\\n\\nTL;DR I accidentally ejaculated to an old clip of my mom when she used to do porn. Now I can’t even look at her. I feel so embarrassed even typing about this even though this happened like an hour ago. I still can\\'t believe I can be this stupid. Me and my friend had  decided that we would meet at a certain point so that we could go have lunch to a place which was close to that point. He told me that even his sister would come along with him. And I was fine with it.\\n\\nNOTE: The problem was that I couldn\\'t seem to remember how she looks because I rarely see her as she stays away from the family.\\n\\nSo back to the present, after sometime I hear someone say Hi and I turn back to see who it was. It was my friend\\'s sister who was walking towards me with her arms outstretched. I commit to the hug because if I didn\\'t it would get awkward. So I hug her and it seemed she really wasn\\'t into it. So I step back from her and check what\\'s wrong.\\n\\nNow I realize I did two mistakes. 1. She wasn\\'t my friend\\'s sister. Because my friend was exactly behind her and with him was a girl. And she was already laughing about it. 2. She actually wanted to hug a person who was behind me and that\\'s why she extended her arms.\\n\\nAfter that they were kinda shocked, I couldn\\'t really tell what their emotions were because I just walked away.\\n\\nAfter that embarrassment I hugged my friend and \\' his sister \\'. And they mocked me until our lunch got over.\\n\\nTL;DR : Basically hugged someone else thinking it was my friend\\'s sister.\\n\\n\\nEdit : After seeing the reaction maybe this was not as embarrassing as I thought it would be. This happened about 45min ago. Some background info: my colleague, let\\'s call her Karen, just got back from mat leave and apparently has been proactively emptying her jugs at lunch time using a breast pump.\\n\\nSo about an hour ago, I started fixing up my daily post-lunch cup of joe when I opened the staff fridge. To my horror there was no more dairy (typically myself and another colleague take turns  supplying cream/milk for the entire office because we\\'re the heavy coffee drinkers). After shuffling around food for 30seconds or so, on the back shelf, I saw a bottle (not quite a baby bottle) filled with some kind of milk. Now I wasnt about to drink my coffee black like some kind of psychopath, so without any hesitation, I grabbed the bottle and loaded my coffee up. Despite the coffee tasting a hint more sweet, I thought nothing of it.\\n\\n15min later, cue Karen going into the fridge and noticing her bottle has moved. Not just that, her superhuman attention to detail has noticed the bottle isnt as full as before and proceeds to go on a witch hunt around the office, yelling \"who the fuck drank my breast milk???\".\\n\\nTL;DR unknowingly added my colleagues breast milk to my afternoon cup of Joe and am now hiding in shame as my colleague is on a witch hunt to find the culprit.\\n\\nEdit: a word\\nEdit2: Thank you to whomever took my gold and silver virginity! Thank you kindly to those who didn\\'t rip me apart! And for those that did... I hope you have a friggen amazing day!\\n\\nUpdate: Holy shit this blew up. I\\'d just like to take a moment to defend myself a little. 1) We have a office rule of unless you label your food, its communal. I didnt think an unlabeled bottle of milk would be breast milk, this leads me to my second point... 2) I have another colleague who occasionally brings milk from home in a water bottle, so I didnt really think much of it. And 3) I\\'ve seen breast milk bottles before, this one was a little taller and didnt have any super apparent volume markings on the side so i didnt second guess anything (I\\'m 26M, not like I see a lot of breast feeding women/bottles anyway).\\n\\nAfter reading how hard it can be to produce breast milk, I feel like absolute shit.  This happened a little while ago but I think it fits here well.\\n\\nI have a friend in Australia (I am Canadian) and we like to send each other candies and care packages every once in a while. He still lives at hope with his very religious mother and his absolute psycho of a sister. It’s not the best situation so sometimes I like sending him funny things to lift his mood.\\nOne day I came across a website that would anonymously and discreetly send anyone you wanted a bag of candy shaped like little penises.  The website geared this toward sending your enemies bags of dicks but I thought this would be funny for my friend seeing as though he’s bi and has a boyfriend that the god fearing mother very much doesn’t know about. Upon checking out, an advert popped up that I could add in a fun confetti surprise along with the dick candies so obviously I obliged and purchased the confetti upgrade.\\n\\nA few weeks later I was in a group call with him and some other friends when he starts telling us about the strangest thing that happened that day.\\nHe was at home and somehow his psycho sister had stolen his mail and left with a friend somewhere.  His sister is 15 or so and was being driven by the Jesus fanatic mother someplace. \\nSister decides to open his mail in the car and what should happen except an absolute explosion of penis shaped glittery confetti all over the interior of the vehicle and right in sisters face.  The girls screamed, the mother probably said some Hail Marys and everyone involved was perfectly mortified. \\nI like to imagine they still find a glittering confetti penis in their car every now and then as a little dick Easter egg. :) \\nMoral of the story is don’t take mail that doesn’t belong to you otherwise you might get a face full of cock-fetti.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR- I sent a friend some penis candy with an explosive dick confetti trap upon opening and his sister took it and opened it in the car with their very religious mother. Cock-fetti EVERYWHERE. Good times. Don’t take other people’s mail. :)\\n\\n\\nEDIT: I can’t believe I forgot to mention that my friend ended up getting in trouble because of it. Religion mom blamed him for “having friends that send him that type of stuff”, not the sister that (illegally) took his mail with his name on it and opened it herself.\\nMy friend had no hard feelings though. He agrees that it’s his sisters fault and she got what she deserved :)\\nAlso thank you to whoever gave me the sticker! That’s so cool!\\n\\nEDIT 2:\\nHoly shit thank you for all the likes and rewards!! \\nThe website I used I believe was dicksbymail.com thought I’m not 100% sure. 🤗 This is a throwaway for obvious reasons, even though this story takes place almost 15 years ago. \\n\\nI was new to having sexual relations with boys, as previously it was only ever my girlfriends who I explored with sexually before boys. So I didn’t have a whole lot to go on as I didn’t have regular internet access to view porn or search sexual questions. \\n\\nSo anyway, my boyfriend and I are getting busy in his basement bedroom. I’m smart enough to be on the pill, and also we had both just gotten tested for STDs before starting to go further in our relationship. Because of these clean tests we decide to bareback the sexy times and he opt to pull out as well, just in case.\\n\\nHe aims and blows his load on my stomach. Except we can’t find it to clean it up.  We looked everywhere and could not find his little splat of spunk. Then we hear the front door unlock and open and the sound of his younger siblings and parents. We quickly get dressed, I spray myself with body spray (good old Calgon) and head upstairs to pretend like we didn’t just bang. \\n\\nI’ve only met his parents a couple times, and they are pretty easy going, especially as they let us sleep over in the same room. I have an uncommon female name and I’m often misnamed. So she reaches in for a hug and doesn’t bother with my name, and then points out that I have a wet spot on my T-shirt. \\n\\nI have always had large enough breasts that I cannot see my tummy by just looking down. I have to lift my shirt. Well stupid me forgets the fiasco moments ago and I lift my shirt slightly to investigate this wet spot. Shining in the afternoon sun, is a long snot like string of jizz attached to my shirt from within my belly button.  His mum gives me this look and says I must have dropped my hair product or something and leaves it at that. I think I’ve gotten away with it. \\n\\nAfter dinner sometime as we are putting away dishes, she takes me aside and hands me a WAD of condoms. Not a word is said, just a handful of condoms. \\n\\nNow I occasionally see her walking in the mall and make awkward eye contact with her and she gives a weird smile. I know the only thing she thinks when she sees me is “bellybutton full of cum”\\n\\n\\nTLDR: boyfriend pulled out and lost his load somewhere, but don’t worry, his mum found it for me. \\n\\nEdit: front page and RIP inbox. I just woke up so I’ll find a ruler for the belly button picture. \\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/K1VsTZe  said picture. Some of y’all seem to think that’s 4 inches. That is 4cm.  This happened 2 hours ago.\\n\\nI was emailing a .txt containing the latest installment of my fanfiction to myself because I\\'d written it on my laptop and I wanted to edit it on my desktop.\\n\\nBut I typed in my work email by accident. It\\'s extremely similar to my personal email, but my work email automatically forwards every incoming message to everyone in my department. Didn\\'t even think about it.\\n\\nI\\'ve never actually gotten physically sick because of a mistake before. The panic has died down a little. I\\'ve begun to accept that this is my life now.\\n\\nIt\\'s not even tame porn you guys.\\n\\nI\\'m going to resign tomorrow, early in the morning, by means of a letter; leave my keys to the building in the envelope; and go back to get a different degree. I\\'ve been thinking about doing it for a while. Guess I don\\'t really have a choice now.\\n\\n**TL;DR:** Sent a chapter of my Harry Potter porn to my coworkers earlier today. Going to resign in disgrace tomorrow.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**EDIT:** Thank you guys for all the advice and reassurance you\\'ve offered. You have no idea how much I needed it. I feel a little more human now, but this thread has gotten away from me. \\n\\nI still plan on resigning. I liked my job, but my boss will hear about this one way or another and as much as I appreciate all of the lies you\\'ve suggested, I honestly can\\'t lie to her. I\\'m a shitty shitty liar and she\\'s a very sharp woman. I won\\'t get fired, she\\'d never pay unemployment as long as she lived, but I can\\'t hope to move up in this particular company after something like this, and my life could get very difficult where I\\'m at.\\n\\nI intend to go back to school. It\\'s what I\\'ve been wanting to do for a long time, but I never had the courage to move forward with it. Fortunately the nearby college has a good nursing program and I\\'m taking steps to register for Fall.\\n\\nNow if you\\'ll excuse me I\\'m going to go lie in bed and stare at the ceiling.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**LAST EDIT:** I know there might be at most 3 people who see this but I felt the need to update. It\\'s very anticlimactic.\\n\\nI calmed down before going into work Monday and decided not to resign right off the bat. I just walked in like everything was normal and tried not to look at anyone. I sent out an email stating that my personal account had been compromised, and to please delete any messages from my personal account, as they may contain viruses. I felt like a dumbass trying to lie, but nobody approached me or acted strangely all day. My boss didn\\'t even speak to me.\\n\\nThese last few days have been the same. Maybe they read it, maybe they didn\\'t, I have no clue. My guess is \"no\" but that might just be wishful thinking. Either way, my life is going on somehow - but I\\'m definitely never going to email myself porn again.\\n\\nAnd for those of you who were curious, it was a HG x LM fic set 5 years after the last book, so no, there was no cp or any other kind of nonsense going on, just regular ol sex between adults, although one is much older than the other. So don\\'t worry. The children are safe. Obligatory this happened 2 weeks ago\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI had been dieseling through a handle of cheap vodka every other day for over a year. I\\'ve never been much of a drinker, but several traumatic events had transpired in a very short amount of time, so I began drinking more to help me cope. I would never consider drinking during the day or before work, but it helped me get through the day. Mixed drinks slowly gave way to straight shots of vodka. I would wake up at 7 am, feed the cat and take several shots. This continued well into the evening until I passed out on the couch or my bed. I started working at a local department store and the schedule was perfect as I didn\\'t have to be in till1pm so I could wake up early, take several shots and sleep on the couch till noon then get ready for work; taking a couple of swigs on my way out the door. I\\'d get home around 10 pm and drink until I passed out.\\n\\nThis past February is when the shakes started, usually near the end of my shift. I\\'d get home, have a few shots and everything would be fine. What was disturbing was my memory loss. I was repeating stories, unsure of what day is was and I even forgot to pick up my nephew from school. Dusk and Dawn were the worst, it took me a few minutes to figure out if was day or night. I knew something had to change. Two Saturdays ago I bought a handle in the afternoon and it was gone by Sunday evening. I woke up Monday morning feeling awful. I was shaking, queasy and terribly off balance, but I didn\\'t drink. By the afternoon I was feeling better and I figured I would get through this. I went to visit my sister and was having a glass of wine and a cigarette out on her back porch when I began to vomit all over her back deck. It was then that the shakes returned with a vengeance.\\n\\nI went home and crashed on the couch. I woke up around 5 am and spent 20 minutes dry-heaving in the bathroom. I tried drinking water, but my hands were shaking so bad that it took both of them to steady the glass. I went back to the couch and drifted in and out of sleep for the majority of the morning. Sometime after noon, I went to get my cat some water, but my hand began to convulse uncontrollably. I tried to steady it with my other hand, but I spilled water everywhere; that was the last thing I remembered. I was laying on my stomach on the living room floor when I noticed a Police Officer standing over me. I had no idea where I was or what had happened. I tried to get to my feet but collapsed onto the couch. My coffee table had been completely turned upside down and its contents were strewn all about the room. My mouth was in so much pain and I saw chunks of blood on the floor where I had been laying. The Officer helped me get my shoes and coat on and assisted me out into the hall.\\n\\nThere were 2 more Officers waiting outside and the helped me down the stairs to an ambulance. The paramedics were asking me questions, but I couldn\\'t answer their questions. once in the Emergency Room, the Doctors and Nurses bombarded me with questions that I could barely answer. My main concern was the throbbing inside my mouth. One of the nurses explained to me that I had chewed off part of my tongue as that was one of the effects of having a seizure. I was admitted later in the evening and that was my sister and nephew came to see me. I could tell by the look in her eyes I was in very bad shape.\\n\\nI was hooked up to several different machines with IV tubes in both arms and a blood pressure cuff that sat snuggly on my left bicep that inflated every 15 minutes; I was on the brink of complete coronary failure. Over the next 3 days and nights I was a prisoner to my bed. There were sensors that would trigger an alarm if my legs went to far over the bed, if I tried to sit up it would set them off as well. If had to pee, they brought me a plastic jug and I had piss in the bed with an audience. Every 30 minutes the blood pressure guff would inflate and take a reading followed by a nurse coming in and injecting medicine into my IVs. The worst part was I couldn\\'t eat and barely drink because of the pain in my tongue. My speech was incomprehensible as my tongue was so swollen. Everyday my sister came to visit and told me she had gone to my apartment to check on my cat and make sure everything was locked up; she even cleaned up the chunks of tongue off the floor.\\n\\nBy Friday afternoon I was stable enough to go home, but with strict limitations. No driving, no strenuous tasks and lots of medication. This past Friday I finally started eating solid food again; after 2 weeks of pureed food it was like heaven to eat a chicken salad sandwich. Everyday I get a little stronger and feel a lot better. I still have trouble with my memory, but I think its good that I don\\'t remember too much about the last year. I spoke to my neighbor; the one who called 911. He told me he had heard me fall and came banging on my door. When I didn\\'t answer he went around to my back door and saw me laying on the floor. He said I looked at him and my face was covered in blood, that was when he called 911. I gave him a hug and he checks in on me daily. My tongue will never heal, but it\\'s a small price to pay to remind me never do that again.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR TIFU by attempting to detox, I suffered a seizure and chewed through my tongue. If my neighbor hadn\\'t been home to hear me fall, I would\\'ve died.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B; I want to start off with saying that AMBIEN is the strongest drug/hallucinogen i\\'ve ever tried and you should not fuck with it.\\n\\nanyways, one night i just couldnt sleep, so i decided to take 4 10mg ambiens (im an idiot) and I had an engagement ring in my drawer than i traded for some other jewelery because i buy and sell stuff on craigslist. anyways, long story short i woke up and she was wearing the ring on her finger and had explained what had happened and i was just shook because i couldnt remember shit. I go on my facebook and apparently my ambien drugged brain changed my relationship status to engaged and it got 150+likes before i fuckin saw it. I had not planned on being engaged with my girlfriend for another year and a half and probably wouldve gotten her a better ring but ambien sped up the process ten folds.\\n\\nWarning: if its 3am, and you can\\'t sleep ,DO NOT TAKE AMBIEN.\\n\\nTL;DR - Took ambien because I couldnt sleep and ended up proposing to my girlfriend that night.\\n\\nedit: Read the comments and I really appreciate the health concerns.  So much so that I\\'m never going to take them again and look for an alternative option for my insomnia. You guys are the best Tbh\\n\\nedit2: apparently taking ONE of these a day is worse on your body than smoking A PACK A DAY. DEFINITELY NOT TOUCHING THEM AGAIN. i\\'m 25M and have been working abroad for the last 3 years. have a girlfriend, dogs and a cat back in the country i work in and have decided to settle there for good. i returned home in april as my parents, both in their early 60\\'s, were tested positive for corona virus in the same month and i wanted to help out with the due processes for treatment. although they recovered quickly it seemed as if i was gonna be stuck at home as the borders closed. initially, my parents and i didn\\'t make it a huge deal but rather viewed it as an opportunity to have a good family time since i was their only child. all good for the next half year - work from home, girlfriend calls me every day, parents love her, i manage to keep a job amidst a massive lay off; so far so good, right?\\n\\nas a wise man once said, \"all perks come with a clause\" and this time it was me becoming retrospective of how i had a tough time through my parents\\' mid-life crisis during which they didn\\'t know whom to blame for their unfounded woes and ended up pointing the finger at my teenage angst. as a way to elude this looming distress in my head, i challenged my parents to a session of rummy after dinner - a casual activity we did as a family when i was younger. nevertheless, this only exacerbated my thoughts on familial grievances one goes through as a teen and we couldn\\'t keep ourselves from exchanging words regarding whose fault it really was that they almost got divorced a little under a decade ago. jacky d\\'s on ice in our hands didn\\'t help either. at a certain point we realized that we were all drunk and it would be best for us to retire for the night and so we did, but not without the last act of slamming our cards and stumbling our way out of the kitchen.\\n\\ni walked out to the porch for a smoke while my parents were still in the living room; knew this because i could hear my mom sobbing. entering the house, i decided to sleep in the couch itself as my room was upstairs and i didn\\'t wish my life to be as anti climatic as falling down the steps to break my neck. at this point i had thought that both of them had gone to bed in their ground floor bedroom, so i fell flat on the couch.\\n\\nto my surprise, a full ten minutes later i heard whispers behind me, whispers in my parents\\' voices by the fireplace and it sounded remorseful. remorseful of mistreating each other and feeling sorry for each other. i let them be, without disturbing them because i thought i owed them at least that much, so i ensured not to disturb their moment by making it known that i wasn\\'t asleep. my mom seemingly playing the sympathy card, somehow turned the conversation sexual and next thing i know they were getting undressed! RIGHT BEHIND ME! even then, a cautious prick that was my dad, hesitated and clearly mentioned my name, but my mom assured him, wrongly, that i had passed out since i hadn\\'t apparently answered a call on my vibrating phone on the coffee table by the couch.\\n\\nMOM, NO! i couldn\\'t stop the inevitable and it happened. my parents had sex in the same room that i was in and i could have even wished to have died instead. i couldn\\'t take it at one point and the alcohol in me found its way out as i hurled my guts out on the coffee table WHILE THEY WERE STILL ON THE F TRAIN! after this, i heard them scurry their way back to their bedroom and the bedroom\\'s door shut. that\\'s when it dawned on me that i wouldn\\'t have broken my 5 year-long non-puke streak had i simply answered to my dad\\'s beckoning or even as my mom said, \"passed out\".\\n\\nwoke up in the middle of the night, cleaned up my mess and walked upstairs to my laptop to type this story while still being drunk. so excuse any error. my worst fear is reading another story in this subreddit from a parent\\'s perspective on how they fucked up by having sex literally behind their son. i don\\'t even know if either of my parents has a reddit account. i do not wish to know. certainly not that way.\\n\\nTL;DR: got drunk and pretended to have passed out in the living room while parents were having sex by the fireplace causing me to spew on the coffee table. Normal physics class and just after our trials examinations. We were all trying to discuss our papers in the class while the lecturer was explaining to the few who personally asked her at the front desk. We had the choice to listen to her explanations or do our own studies to prepare ourselves for AS examinations. I was too focused on my own mistakes, the first few parts of the papers.\\n\\nAfter some time, she was explaining a question which got the majority of the class. It was a cupboard supported by a nail which is against a wall. The following question was \"How much weight can the cupboard support before it falls?\" It was a multiple choice question with the answers being something around 12kg, 22kg, 220kg and 2200kg. It was 220kg.\\n\\nMy friend was really bugged about it and proceeded to rant to me about it. Keep in mind, I was not paying attention at all towards her or the question as I was a dumb idiot trying to understand simple questions.\\n\\nFriend: This doesn\\'t make any sense. From my point of view, a cupboard can\\'t hold that much.\\n\\nMe: It\\'s Physics, what else do you expect.\\n\\nFriend: A nail can\\'t withstand that much weight.\\n\\nMe: It kind of did for Jesus.\\n\\nI felt a slight tap and saw my friend pointing to the front. Only after I saw my lecturer\\'s face, I realised what I said. My lecturer was in a serious mood during these past couple of weeks as our examinations were coming soon. Also, she is a pious Christian. On the bright side, the weather outside the classroom was lovely.\\n\\nTL;DR: A friend asked how a nail help a cupboard support a big weight. I said it did for Jesus. Lecturer heard and sent me out of class.\\n\\nEdit: Accidentally typed \\'he\\' instead of \\'she\\' This occurred about a month ago, my girlfriend was in the kitchen cooking, unbeknownst to me, my 4 y.o son was sitting at the dining table having a snack. I walked out of the bedroom, up to my girlfriend and gave her a good ‘attagirl’ slap on the rump.\\n\\nMy son immediately perks up, “Hey you hit <gf’s name>, why?!”. Thinking I was a bit of a wit that can straddle the line between innuendo and educating my son I replied, “She’s a bad girl. Sometimes bad girls need a slap” while giving my gf a sleazy old wink.\\n\\nMy son nods sagely while my gf just rolls her eyes. End of story as a far as I’m concerned.\\n\\nNot so, the next day my ex-wife got a call from pre-school asking both parents to come in and see the principal.\\n\\nApparently, my son’s poor old teacher had told him to put away the toys as it was time for another activity. Unsatisfied with this direction my son went up to his teacher and gave her a big whomp on the cheek. When asked why he did that, my son’s reply was, “Because you are very very bad girl! You need a slap”.\\n\\nCue awkward explanation of my domestic habits to my ex-wife and son’s principal. I welcome self isolation.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL:DR Had to explain why I slapped my gf on the ass to my son\\'s principal and ex-wife.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT:I appreciate those who see this scenario as what it was. I know I fucked up, I acknowledge as much by posting in this sub.\\n\\nHowever, I disagree that somehow that makes me a bad parent. A few of you have taken the opportunity to message me to tell me that I\\'ve failed my kid, I should lose custody or that I routinely go around slapping women because I\\'m some misogynistic ass bandit.\\n\\nOur family have a great sense of humor and I routinely mess around with my son. He\\'s smart enough (usually) to get when I\\'m being serious or when I\\'m just messing around.\\n\\nWe\\'ve since had a good chat and now my son knows that the incident is just a joke between my gf and I, but that I shouldn\\'t have done it in front of him and he certainly should not do it to anyone else. He gets it. All parties are happy. Not the end of the world.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHope you all are keeping safe and staying isolated! For context, my mum moved houses and during the move she and my sister found a huge box of expired condoms in my old room. I haven\\'t lived at my mum\\'s since I was 18 and at the time I didn\\'t have a girlfriend. So they were quite shocked.\\n\\nI had to tell them the story how I acquired my collection of unused protection. When I was 14 years old, me and a friend went on a first holiday trip without any parents. It was on an island on the coast of my home country. Believe me, it is not as cool as it sounds...\\n\\nAnyway, this freedom gave me the courage to go and try out a condom. You know, because I want to be prepared for when the day would come. So I said to my friend that I would go to the store and do some groceries. On the island there are only two supermarkets and either one is on the other side of the island. Once I got to the store I was very nervous. I thought it must have looked very strange: a 14 year old kid buying condoms. So I did the age old trick of buying a pack of gum to seem less suspicious.\\n\\nOnce I located the condoms I saw something I didn\\'t suspect. It was a box with 12 smaller packets sealed inside. The cleric should have unsealed the packets, and I should have known this wasn\\'t normal! But what did I do? I took the whole box!\\n\\nI waited a bit so the conveyor belt was empty, and so that no one could see what I was buying. There, a cute cashier that was a few years older than I was, greeted me with a smile, which soon turned in confusion and disgust once she saw the huge box of condoms.\\n\\nI just wanted to get out of there as fast as I could. She scanned the gum, €1.15 alright. Then she scanned the box, €4.30.. However there was some confusion. She didn\\'t trust it fully and tried scanning it again. Then the cashier requested backup. This sadly took a moment and by the time backup came to help her, a huge line accumulated behind me: the thing I didn\\'t want to happen. The backup, a girl in her early twenties gave me the same awkward greeting as the younger cashier. In the end she figured out how to scan the huge box and gave me this horrific sentence: \"That is then €52,75.\"\\n\\nI should have just said that this was a mistake. That I just wanted one packet. That I was not going to need them until I was much older. But what did I do? My 14 year old stupid ass took my wallet. And PAID! Red as a tomato I took the plastic debit card and pushed in my pincode. While tears were welling up, I rushed out the store but then remembered that I said to my friend that I would go grocery shopping! Fuck! I had two choices: either go back and face the girl again. Or cycle all the way to the other side of the island and do my shopping there. Of course I chose the latter.\\n\\nIn the end I had to tell the whole story to my mum and sister. I hope you got some of the same enjoyment out of this story like them..\\n\\nTL;DR My mum and sister found out that I paid way too much for unused condoms when I was a kid. So I’ve always hated feet. My feet, others feet, sandals, flip flops, if I see toes I’m out. \\n\\nEver since I was a kid I’ve always worn socks. It’s just a thing I never thought about. Way better than running around with nasty black soles like the others. \\n\\nSo like 5 years back I started struggling with dry flaky skin around my toes. No big, I’ll just moisturize more. Didn’t work. No big, I’ll just keep everything dry and change socks.  Dry skin and so itchy... no big I’ll get a pedegg or something. \\n\\nWell apart from being moderately itchy and occasionally rubbing skin raw, it wasn’t really a bother so I left it. For 5 years. \\n\\nAs an adult time really does fly. Things that aren’t in your face don’t seem to be a big deal. No partner ever said anything because things were always covered by socks. \\n\\nOne day I was at Walmart and saw the gross foot section (which I always ignored because FEET) and I saw the medications for athletes foot. Surely... I can’t be this dumb.... right?\\n\\nWrong. Within a WEEK of using this athletes foot spray, it cleared by 90%. A couple weeks later, no more dry flakey skin. No more raw areas. No bad footy smell that I always thought that’s how gross nasty feet smelled (it’s not, apparently!).\\n\\nI still hate feet, but please take care of yourselves. Don’t fuck up like me and not take care of an easily treatable with OTC medication fungus. \\n\\n\\nTL;DR had athletes foot for over five years, eventually figured it was athletes foot, cleared up within 3 weeks\\n\\nEDIT: to all the people experiencing the same thing, go to the store now!!! If you’re embarrassed, that’s why god invented self-checkout. F U N G U S. GO NOW!\\n\\nEdit 2: I used the Equate Antifungal Spray from Walmart, and when that went out I switched to the Equate Antifungal cream since it was easier to get in the (barf) nooks and crannies of the toes... I almost threw up writing that, please don’t make me talk about feet any more...\\n\\nEdit 3: IM NOT GONNA PEE ON MY FEET STOP RECOMMENDING IT PLEASE\\n\\nEdit 4: thanks for the gold and awards but I still hate feet This happened on Friday, and I\\'m just now able to relive it without experiencing Tourette-like outbursts of random noises and profanity from my extreme discomfort from the embarrassment.\\n\\nI\\'m sitting on the toilet in the downstairs bathroom (which is right by the front door of our house), I have the door mostly closed, but it\\'s not latched. Doorbell rings, my wife answers it, it\\'s her friend Jen. Jen comes in the house. I should mention that Jen is a friend/neighbor we\\'ve known for just under a year and I don\\'t really know her that well, which, for me, makes this worse.\\n\\nI\\'m just finishing up, getting ready to wipe. I pull on the first piece of toilet paper, and as the toilet paper unrolls this big, and very fast spider comes running from behind the roll, brushing against my hand. Instinctively, I jump up and away from this spider, as I do this, the door to the bathroom opens, there\\'s Jen, we both scream, me because my fight or flight (in this case flight) response automatically kicks in from my lizard brain thinking I\\'m getting attacked by this spider, and Jen seeing her friend\\'s husband with his pants and underwear down between his legs leaping toward her screaming.\\n\\nA lot of apologies and light uncomfortable laughter afterwards, and I haven\\'t slept well since.\\n\\nTL;DR: TIFU by exposing myself to my wife\\'s friend when I jumped from a spider while sitting on the toilet, right when my wife\\'s friend walked into the bathroom.\\n\\nEDIT: Wow, my first silver and first gold! Thanks!! I had to stop reading these for awhile today, I tend to keep replaying embarrassing things over and over my random noise Tourettes started acting up. Tonight is definitely an Ambien night. First thing you should know is this happened yesterday right before I left for work and I’ve had an urge to tell someone since then but I was unable to find a better outlet than a bunch of internet strangers. \\n\\nSecond thing you should know is that I am female. \\n\\nThird is that my dog is doing fine without any signs of trauma, unlike the rest of the parties involved. \\n\\nSo yesterday started as a normal day. I woke up with my boyfriend by my side, took my morning shower, returned to bed and did our usual dirty to start the day. \\n\\nI continued with the usual routine; get dressed, let the dogs out, make coffee, and lastly, do my make up in the down stairs bathroom... that’s when thing took an unusual turn.\\n\\nI’m finishing up my makeup in the mirror of my tiny 1/2 bath when my boyfriend is watching at the door. He comes up to me ready to go for a second round to which I, disappointingly, reply that I would be late for work if we went for round two. His response was that it was going to be a quick one and just to grab it. He comes closer into the small bathroom and grabs me and I grab him.\\n\\nI start to get into it, I kiss his neck, he starts to get close pretty fast so I’m kind of angling it away from me to the side of my right hip so that I don’t have to get dressed for work twice in one day. By the time I realize it’s actually happening, it was too late. In the heat of the moment, neither of us realized that my 50lb pit mix has wedged her way past us in the cramped space, or was patiently waiting for an exit the whole time. I have no idea how long she had been in there. All I do know, and what will forever be burned into my memory, is that I realize the moment is happening and I look down to try and catch it and not get it on my clothes when I see my dogs adorable innocent face looking up at us in absolute horror as she gets the money shot of all money shots. \\n\\nI gasp as she’s looking up at me with one eye open and one eye trying to open but failing at this point. Her tongue starts to come out and that’s when I see the last bit stretching from her nose to the tip of my boyfriends dick and thank god my boyfriend snaps into action at this point and grabs it before my precious fur baby ate a shot of protein for breakfast. The last thing I’ll remember is my boyfriend chasing her around the house with a piece of wadded up toilet paper. \\n\\nSince then, we have all had to all go about our days like we weren’t forever traumatized by our unwanted bestiality threesome. \\n\\nTLDR:  Gave my boyfriend a hand job that ended up on my dogs face.\\n\\nEdit part 1: Thanks strangers for the Reddit awards! My first ever!\\n\\nEdit part 2: Enough people have commented on how I showered before sex so I guess I’m going to clear it up for everyone. Sometimes I shower before, sometimes I shower after. Not every sexual encounter is like crazy dirty and sweaty. If I shower before he usually pulls out and catches it with a tissue so I’m not dirty for work...that’s when you know it’s true love? And I guess to clarify, my house isn’t full of bodily fluids. \\n\\nThanks everyone for reading, I’m viewing the world a tad bit different now that this post is the most seen thing that has ever happened to me. This  fuck up was over the weekend. It occurred Saturday, but I didn’t find out about it until Sunday. I am  working with my plumber on a bathroom remodel, and needed to send him  details on the fixtures and fittings needed. I had a list of things that  I had taken a photo of.  I wrote up the email on my phone and at the  bottom, inserted the image I needed to send him. I saw the correct  image pop in and then hit send.\\n\\nToday  I get a response to my email, that simply asked if I could provide him  with the quote number. No mention of my fuck up. I start to scroll down  to look at picture I sent to him, and as I scroll past the correct  picture, I see my wife’s head pop into view. This was a picture we had  taken Friday night. The one next to the image I correctly sent in my  photo album (hadn’t had chance to make hidden yet). I started to panic,  thinking maybe it was just a technology glitch, referencing wrong image  somehow, but I opened up my original email to him, and there my wife  was, pleasuring me.\\n\\nThere was no  way he didn’t see it in the email, but he clearly responded, including  the images, to politely let me know about my fuck up.\\n\\nI  sent a response back, acknowledging my fuck up and apologized. Kindly  asking him to delete the email. He responded saying he had, and all I  can do is trust that he did.\\n\\n———————\\n\\nUPDATE: So I took the advice of a small number of you and sat down with my wife this evening to sheepishly explain what had happened over the weekend. It was only right, since she was in the picture and as much as I’d love to trust my plumbers word, I needed to be honest and open.\\n\\nWhen we first sat down, she was having one of those... oh shit... a serious talk moment. I could see the nervousness on her face. I assured her that what I was about to tell her was not as bad as she may be expecting. She asked if she would want to divorce me... I said, hopefully not.\\n\\nI began to explain the story above about how I had been emailing the plumber, and I could see the confusion building on her face. I said that I had attached a photo, and somehow a second photo had attached. It took her a moment before things clicked. \\n\\nFirst question. Which photo? I grabbed my phone and pulled up the photo in question. There was a little bit of relief on her face. “Well, my face isn’t 100% clear, could be any asian”. To be honest my photography skills are a bit shoddy, but her face was somewhat visible. Luckily, her naked body wasn’t visible. This added to her relief.\\n\\nAs we talked more, she started to laugh a little, mostly at my stupidity. I then said we needed \\nto talk about what to do about the plumber. She assumed that I was the one uncomfortable with our plumber now, but I said I was fine, but happy to decline his services if she felt in any way uncomfortable. She said she was ok with the situation, but may try to avoid being around. \\n\\nSo, looks like we still have a plumber for now.\\n\\nI even showed her my post here on TIFU, and she was amazed how quickly the story blew up. She even joked that I had sent the wrong picture to the wrong person. She would have preferred if I sent to our roofer instead.\\n\\n\\n———————\\n\\nTL;DR Sent plumber a picture of my plumbing TIFU, and it actually happened today. I was driving with my 12 year old daughter. We got caught at a red light next to a restaurant. I glanced at the restaurant and saw a kid walking in the parking lot by himself. It looked like my daughter’s friend Gabe. I said to her, “is that...” and before I could even finish, she said yes. \\n\\nSo I suggested we say hi to him. I rolled down my window and screamed “Gabe!” The kid turned around, and that’s when I realized it wasn’t Gabe. It was a younger boy, maybe 9 years old. \\n\\nSo here’s the thing. This kid isn’t Gabe. God only knows if he’s even heard the name Gabe before. And it’s a busy intersection, so it’s noisy. \\n\\nThe kid had such a puzzled and embarrassed look on his face, and he ran to his car. And that’s when I realized, this 9 year old kid thinks a middle aged woman just rolled down her car window, screamed “gay!!!” at him, and drove away. My daughter laughed her ass off at me. \\n\\nTL;DR: I called an elementary school kid gay while stopped at a red light.\\n\\nEdited for a typo. The kid was walking. Not waking, not wanking. Just walking. I work with a known drug addict, who uses intravenous drugs regularly. He is HIV+, and has a few other diseases from sharing needles. I arrived at his home to pick him up, and found his door wide open.\\n\\nOK, weird, I thought. I call his phone about 5 times, no answer. I call his name verbally, no response. At this point I decide to walk into his home, something in technically not supposed to do unless he\\'s with me, but obviously something is wrong.\\n\\nI step into the doorway, and can hear a faucet running, it\\'s coming from the kitchen. I call his name loudly, asking if he\\'s hurt or something, silence. I go into the kitchen and the sink is running full blast, with water all over the floor, and a trail of what appears to be water mixed with blood leading out of the kitchen.\\n\\nFollowing the trail leads me to his bedroom door, slightly open, TV on. I knock first, thinking I\\'m about to walk in on a murder scene or something. He\\'s on the floor, drool dripping from his mouth. Completely unresponsive to me. He\\'s partially covered in a soaking wet blanket, so I reach to pull it off of him, and immediately feel a sharp pinch to the side of my hand. I jerk my hand back immediately, think it was maybe a broken bottle or something, and could see that I was bleeding just a teeny tiny bit.\\n\\nI use my foot/shoe to move the blanket around, and a syringe hits the ground, half full of blood/drugs mixed together.\\nMy heart immediately dropped, and I went into full panic mode. I starting screaming his name at this point, and he moved a little bit, slowly coming to. I asked him repeatedly if he had just used the needle, but he was high out of his mind and couldn\\'t even talk properly.\\n\\nI decide I\\'ve done enough, and call an ambulance. I sit with him until they arrive, and give them all the details. This literally happened this morning, so I\\'m still in Limbo as far as whether I\\'ve contracted anything from his needle.\\n\\nAs you can imagine, I\\'m pretty fucking scared right now, but I was given a drug at the hospital that supposedly helps minimize transmission after an exposure. I can only hope to God that it works. He was taken to ER, and allowed to detox, presumably he\\'ll be fine. I\\'m no longer going to be working on his case after this incident.\\n\\nTl;dr: I accidentally stabbed myself with my clients HIV+ contaminated needle. Let’s start off by saying I’m a single dad and my son is in kindergarten. His teacher sent out a message yesterday that said “Tomorrow for Pi day we have a parent bringing in a snack.” I had only glanced at it. Ten minutes later, I got a message from my son’s mom asking if I have a matching set of Pjs for him to wear. I replied yes, and then never looked at the teacher’s email again.  \\n\\nFast forward to this morning, and I dress my boy in his favorite Pjs and take him to school. As I approach, I notice that no one else is wearing Pjs and my son is trotting around in bright red spider man pajama pants. So I get him to the door of the school, send him in, and immediately pull my phone out to look at the email. I had to read it twice before I noticed that it didn’t say “Pj Day” at all, but fucking “Pi Day!” \\n\\nSo I sent an email to his teacher explaining the mix up and asked her to make him feel comfortable today. She said she glossed it over with the other kids and made it a non issue. Luckily, they are only 5-year-olds in kindergarten with little self awareness. \\n\\nSo sorry, son! Here’s a little lesson on being different!!\\n\\nTL;DR - Sent my son to school in his pajamas because I had misread “Pi Day” as “Pj Day” in a school email. His teacher made it a non issue in class and it didn’t scar my son for life, hopefully. \\n\\n\\n\\nUPDATE: His mom picked him up and said that he immediately asked to call me to let me know that today was not pajama day.  He said that his teacher let him slide because he had enough classroom points, but he knows that it wasn’t Pj day. Lol. His mom took part of the blame. Thank goodness he’s so young. This would not have worked out as well in first or second grade. \\n\\nEdit: Wow! My first gold and silver. Thanks everyone!! I’m glad you enjoyed my story. \\n\\nEdit 2: Sorry for my choice of wording. But let me clarify that there wasn’t any blame or consequence by the teacher.  I was self blaming, if anything. The teacher just used the classroom points as a hollow excuse to lighten any ridicule or confrontation from the other kids. I think she was just trying to bring it forward in a positive light and then get past it and move on. No blame or consequence. Just the teacher spreading sugar and me feeling like an ass.  So I\\'m Korean-Canadian but was born in Canada and have grown up here my entire life. I \"speak\" Korean but it\\'s about at the level of a talented ten year old with a funny Canadian accent.\\n\\nFuck-up happened yesterday. I’m walking down the sidewalk and who I assume are a man and his daughter (who appears around my age) are puzzling in Korean over a directory sign. I ask (in Korean) if they need any help. The dad seems excited to meet someone who speaks Korean. The girl seems shy and doesn\\'t say much besides \"thanks.\" They’re looking for a nearby mall so I offer to walk them over there since the train station I need is nearby anyway.\\n\\nThe dad asks me where I learned to speak Korean so well. This is where the fuck-up begins. I\\'m pretty insecure about my spoken Korean, so when the dad asks where I learned the language, it sounds like he thinks it’s obvious I’m not “actually” Korean. It doesn’t help that his daughter is ridiculously pretty, and I want to impress her for some reason. So, I lie. Stupid idea. I say I’m actually Chinese and learned Korean on my spare time, changing my skills from “mediocre for a Korean person” to “impressive for a Chinese person.”\\n\\nAlas, the dad immediately switches to Mandarin which I can’t speak a word of. This would have been the time to come clean. Instead, panicking at having been exposed, I do my best confused face and then pretend I misspoke and said the Korean word for “Chinese” (Jung-guk) when I in fact meant “Japanese” (Ilbon). Ha-ha, sorry, my Korean isn’t very good, right?\\n\\nOf course, the daughter suddenly bursts into fluent and excited Japanese, which I also can’t speak a word of. I’m in too deep at this point and can’t tell them I’m Vietnamese or some other variety of Asian without making myself even more suspicious, so I do the only logical thing and say I am indeed Japanese but don’t actually speak Japanese (but learned Korean cuz lol I’m a traitor to my Japanese heritage).\\n\\nWe reach the mall and I’m all too happy to bail at this point, but the girl, who suddenly seems super interested in me, asks (now in practically perfect English – damn polyglots) what I do. I say I go to the local university. She excitedly tells me that she’s starting at the same university in September, and that she has just arrived in Canada from Korea. Her “dad” seems just as excited by this news and asks me to take care of her once school starts and he goes back to Korea.\\n\\nIt turns out that the girl is actually Japanese but went to some exchange program in Korea for a few years, and that the “dad” is actually her Chinese-born Korean teacher/ sponsor who accompanied her to Canada. So, not only did I pretend not to be Korean to two people who weren’t even Korean, but I pretended to be Chinese to a Chinese man and have now convinced a Japanese girl that I’m Japanese.\\n\\nSo I exchanged contact information with the girl and we’ve been talking a lot online since yesterday. Turns out she’s super nice and funny and interesting and accomplished. We have a ton in common too. We have the same major, and we’re the same age, though she’s three years behind me because of her exchange program. She seems super stoked to be friends with me since she doesn’t know anybody in Canada and has been talking to me a lot. I’m becoming increasingly aware that I can’t pretend to be Japanese forever to this girl and I need to tell her I’m actually Korean, but early on she asked me about my family and I went even deeper into the lie, telling her my parents are from Kyoto (picked a random city), etc. I\\'ve done fucked up, Reddit, and I feel terrible about it.\\n\\n**TL;DR:** Am Korean, pretended to be Chinese to a Chinese man, then pretended to be Japanese to an awesome Japanese girl and am now her first friend in Canada (based on a dirty lie).\\n\\n\\n**EDIT:** OHHH FUCK I THINK SHE JUST ASKED ME OUT BUT I\\'M NOT SURE AND I HAVEN\\'T COME CLEAN YET HELP\\n\\n**EDIT 2 (Night of the 2nd Day):** Thank you all for the sage advice. I have not yet perished of seppuku as some have feared, although it is increasingly seeming the most promising solution. I\\'m sure she\\'d oblige me and do the beheading part.\\nAnyway, I do think we\\'re going on a date tomorrow and I thought I should come clean in person rather than over text. Will keep you all updated (unless I die). I haven\\'t even been on a date in over two years so that\\'s already blowing my mind, especially her asking me out. As some have pointed out, I am kinda concerned that she\\'s only interested in me because she thinks I\\'m Japanese, but I think that\\'s more to do with her being more comfortable in a foreign country (Canada) when her first friend is a fellow Japanese person. Maybe I\\'m terrible at social cues and she just wants to hang out as a friend. In any case, I\\'ll explain it all to her tomorrow in the hopes of being a little less of an asshole (there\\'s no solving that completely). Wish me luck in as many languages as you can, Reddit. Gamsahamnida.\\n\\nAlso: they don\\'t use Reddit much in Japan and Korea, do they? I\\'d hate to be busted via a Reddit thread Q_Q\\n\\n**EDIT 3 (Still Night of the 2nd Day)**: OH FUCK GUYS I FUCKED UP AGAIN. I was afraid she might stumble upon this post so I asked her if she has heard of Reddit cuz I\\'m a fucking idiot and she said no, much to my relief, but then she asked if she should check it out and I just realized this is going on the front page at this rate and she\\'s gonna find it somebody order an airstrike on me why am I so stupid.\\n\\nDON\\'T LIE, KIDS. LYING IS VERY VERY BAD.\\n\\n**EDIT 4 (Still Night of the 2nd Day):** Okay I think crisis averted for now. She just went to sleep without any sign of having read this. I\\'m also going to attempt to sleep and hope I wake up Japanese. Will update. Sayonara, Reddit. This happened about 7 years ago. I am South African and was dating a Dutch girl at the time. For those of you who don’t know my home language (Afrikaans) and Dutch are pretty similar. Linguistically speaking, we have about a 70% overlap in vocabulary (words) however the meaning of the same word in both languages sometimes mean something totally different. \\n\\nI was dating this girl for around 9 months. She flew down to South Africa, and I took her to one of our national parks on one of the weekends. On the last evening of her visit, we were sitting next to a large open lake. \\n\\nAs I looked at her, a sudden rush of emotions occurred. I took her hands in mine, looked her in the eyes… and said (in English): “I love you”. This was the first time Ive said that.  For a moment I thought I caught her off guard but she looks at me with a straight face and says in Dutch: “Ik hou van je” (which in Afrikaans means “I LIKE you”). I felt this strong pain hit my chest as we had already talked about moving in together etc. This hit me so hard, that I couldn’t look at her. \\n\\nStill needing to keep face, I said I think we should go back to the hotel. Over the course of the next few hours I became ever increasingly distant. She wanted to initiate sexy time, but I kept rejecting her attempts saying “that I am not in the mood”. \\n\\nThe next morning we checked out and we drove to the airport. Upon arrival, I dropped her off departures gate and thanked her for a lovely time. Told her that things have become clearer to me over the course of the evening, and that I don’t think we should see each other anymore. She (of course) burst into tears, took her bags, and left my car. \\n\\nWe didn’t text for two days. On the third day she sends me a text asking why I broke up with her… I explained that it hit me really hard that I declared my love for her and my feelings weren’t reciprocated. Perplexed, she phones me… And the mature asshole that I am, I rejected the call. She sends me a voice note saying she doesn’t understand… As when I said I loved her, she said it back. \\n\\nLong story short: Apparently the word “hou” (i.e. “Like” in Afrikaans) means “Love” in Dutch. \\n\\nMan did I fuck up! In the end we could laugh about it, and decided never to speak in Dutch again :P (We only lasted another 8 months after this incident though for other reasons)\\n\\nTL;DR: I declared my love for my Dutch Girlfriend, and she responded in Dutch with “I like you”. I broke up with her the next day, and was only later informed that the word “like” in Afrikaans means “love” in Dutch.\\n\\nEDIT 1: For some context, there were other (more serious) issues that occurred and this was the straw that broke the camels back. One was that she was actually in a relationship with someone else and I was the \"side guy\" as she didn\\'t think I would leave my job and life in SA to move to NL.\\n\\nEDIT 2:  What happened afterwards some people  asked. Well, I moved to the Netherlands for her and she then moved in with me... She didn\\'t work, and well lets just say she really liked Africans, had alot of spare time while I was at work and one apparently one African wasn\\'t enough to satisfy her. This just happened about 30 minutes ago. Not by me, but my girlfriend (she doesn\\'t have a Reddit account) and I was involved.\\n\\nThis  morning I came downstairs to join my girlfriend in working at our  dining room table together, as we do every day during stay at home. As I  was coming down the stairs, she was wearing headphones and was leaving a  voicemail on the phone of a vendor that she works with. Once she  stopped talking and turned her attention to me, I told her I didn\\'t  sleep well and that I was starving. I asked her if she wanted a parfait  with the strawberries we got and we started a short conversation about  them going bad and needing to eat them...\\n\\nAs  I start cutting the strawberries and speaking with her about them, she  tells me \"Your voice is all deep and sexy. It\\'s making my pussy all  wet!\" Just then she looks down at her phone and realizes that she never  hung up on the voicemail she was leaving and in a panic hung up  instantly. Mortified, she told me what happened and tried to laugh it  off. I told her the voicemail was way too long and it most likely shut  off.\\n\\nCue to about 10 minutes after  that. The vendor calls her back and they have a lengthy conversation  about the business part of the voicemail. My girlfriend thought she\\'d  gotten off the hook until the vendor said \"So can I tell you something  off the record? I heard that voicemail you left and you said something  pretty lewd. I just wanted to let you know in case something was wrong  on your end.\" My girlfriend went bright red and profusely apologized and  said she wasn\\'t aware that the voicemail was recording etc. The woman  on the other end was really cool about it, but my girlfriend started her  Friday in possibly the worst way she can think of.\\n\\n    TL;DR Left a voicemail on a vendors phone telling them my pussy is getting wet. Thought I got away with it, but got called out later by the vendor. Have you ever done a dumb thing out of spite? Buckle up.\\n\\nI have an ongoing zoodle infatuation because zoodles are a low-guilt sauce converyor belt to my mouth. \\nI\\'ve stocked up on pasta sauce and I\\'m taking mealtimes SERIOUSLY. Nothing is wasted, leftovers are used, end of story. So a couple days ago when my boyfriend, let\\'s call him David, found an open bottle of vodka sauce I autopilot shoved in the pantry-\\n\\nDavid: \"This has to go in the fridge. It\\'s probably no good now.\"\\n\\nMe, not openly questioning my partner\\'s judgement, but also knowing that he does not count the forehead as part of the face so I cannot put blind faith in everything he says: \"It will be fine. I opened it, like, yesterday. Or, two days ago.\"\\n\\nDavid: \"It should have been refrigerated. I really don\\'t think you should eat this.\"\\n\\nNow, I\\'ve watched David put sesame oil in the fridge. He thinks soy sauce belongs in the fridge. We have very different ideas on what belongs in the fridge. But should the vodka sauce have gone in the fridge? Probably. Was I going to throw it away, both wasting food and admitting he was right? Absolutely not. \\n\\nThe vodka sauce goes into the fridge instead of the trash.\\n\\nCut to yesterday night, where I have already eaten dinner but I am an emotional binge eater and I had to fill the sad with food, you know how it goes. What will make the sad go away? Zoodles with the opened Vodka sauce.\\n\\nIt was only until after I had made everything did I notice the perfect, circular fluff of mold growing on the lid of the sauce jar. But it\\'s only on the lid, right? If I tell David about this, while he would never say, \"I told you so\", he would sit on this in quiet triumph for the rest of our lives. Mr. Forehead-isn\\'t-part-of-the-face guy.\\n\\nIt\\'s fine. The food is fine, I think as I eat it. I tell myself that it doesn\\'t taste off in the way that you tell yourself that vegetarian sausage tastes like the real thing. \\n\\nThe vodka sauce quietly goes into the garbage.\\n\\nCut to midnight, where we are watching a movie. Things are feeling off in my stomach, and there\\'s some major gurgling going on. Then there\\'s a shift, and pain explodes through the red carpet of my intestines for a good long while until I have no choice but to explain to the love of my life why I\\'m basically fetal. \\n\\nDavid does not say \"I told you so\", but I know he is secretly balancing the checkbook of arguments he\\'s won. He rubs my belly while I cry. I love him.\\n\\nIt\\'s now 3AM and I\\'ve been farting for what feels  like my entire life? Once upon a time, I had a life and a job and could go outside, and now I have no life and no job and my knees are at ear-level while I\\'m on the john, seranading my septic system with a cacophony of rich bass and tenor farts. I\\'m sweating harder than I do when I work out. I\\'m probably working out harder right now than I do when I work out. I am shitting my lungs out over a bad bottle of sauce and a hill I really shouldn\\'t have died on. \\n\\nDon\\'t be like me, kids.\\n\\nTl;dr: I gave myself food poisoning and turned myself into an ass trumpet to win an argument. Lost the argument anyway. Years ago I set up some [Google Alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts) for some random things I was interested in at the time. I started getting a lot of alerts so I created a folder in my inbox where emails from Google would get automatically routed. After a few months I lost interest in those alerts and stopped checking the folder.\\n\\nA couple years later I applied for a job a Google. I never heard back and just forgot about it, figuring they weren\\'t interested. So about a year later I decided to clean up my email folders and inbox. I found an oddly titled email in the \"Alerts\" folder that didn\\'t match the usual alert format, so I read it. It was from Google asking me what day I might be available to come in for an interview. This was back when Google was growing like mad and I would have gotten stock options. FML.\\n\\nTL;DR: I missed an opportunity to work for Google because I thought I was being clever years earlier. So, I work in IT repair. PC, tablets, Mobile phones, that sort of thing. Which means, as anyone in the field can attest, means giving free tech support to family and friends. \\n\\nSo about 2 weeks ago, I\\'m at my wife\\'s parent\\'s house, taking a look at their sick desktop in return for having my Father-in-Law service my car. (He\\'s a mechanic)\\n\\nAnyway, FiL comes back inside for a coffee break, and is asking me questions about how to sell stuff on eBay. I fire up a browser window, head to eBay and log into his account. My eyes immediately lock onto the fact in the \"recently viewed\" items are an assortment of horse riding crops.\\n\\nMy mind logs this as odd, somewhere in the back of my brain, and moves on with the tutorial, my Father-in-Law finishes his coffee and heads back out to my car.\\n\\nI return to cleaning up his PC and scans, etc find a few things that are tied back to a bunch of BDSM / Fetish porn sites, spanking videos, etc.\\n\\nNow normally, after a decade of dealing with people\\'s PCs, I have a very \"no judgements\" stance with this sort of stuff. At least the eBay searches for riding crops make sense... \\nBut my mind chose that moment to remind me that my wife has (somewhat) recently revealed that she\\'s kinda into that sort of thing. We recently had a \"dirty weekend away\", where she revealed that she had recently purchased an assortment of paddles, whips, restraints, and things that vibrate (Thanks Fifty Shades... I guess...?)\\n*Not complaining - lf it gets her off, I\\'ll try just about anything at least once. *\\n\\nAnd now, from that day forward, whenever things have gotten a little... spicy in the bedroom, there\\'s a part of my brain that\\'s thinking \"Do you know that your parents are into this stuff too?\" 🤔\\n\\n(I\\'m sure my wife does NOT have any knowledge of this, and to learn of it would mortify her to the point that we\\'d never have sex again.)\\n\\n\\nTL:DR - Fixing my In-Law\\'s PC, I discovered that they\\'re into the same Kink as my wife... now wondering if my wife\\'s sexual appetites are genetically inherited, or learnt subconsciously.  Yeah, TIFU (last night) royally.  I was watching the making of  \"Our Planet\" last night and got about 50 mins into it and paused to let my GF in my apartment.  If you haven\\'t seen it, I highly recommend it!  Incredible behind the scene documentation of how the videographers set up shots, traveled to exotic locations, survived in insane climates...ending with an unannounced scene of walruses falling to their deaths from a fucking **80 meter cliff**.\\n\\nMy girlfriend comes in, we start cuddling on the couch, resume the doc, and then really sad music starts playing out of nowhere...  I have never seen this documentary before and everything else leading up to it was wholesome af, so this was a little alarming.  Before you know it, these god damn walruses are tumbling down giant cliffs because WHO THE FUCK KNOWS.  Even the camera crew was like \"WHY ARE THEY CLIMBING SO HIGH?!\"  For god\\'s sake, the footage was in super slow motion and we can clearly see these poor animals\\' skulls and tusks cracking with every tumble with their bodies curling over one another into a dead walrus stock pile.  It was truly awful and heartbreaking to watch.\\n\\nMy GF immediately separates herself from me, tears silently streaming down her face and says \"I\\'m going to bed\"; It all happened so fast.  She was upstairs crying and I\\'m staring at a screen filled with dead fucking walruses while camermen and biologists continue crying on screen.  Guilt welled up in me because it was my idea to continue watching when she arrived.  It didn\\'t help that she made it clear she is extremely sensitive to any sort of animal death early on in our relationship.\\n\\nI went upstairs and cuddled up next to her while apologizing.  She understood and wasn\\'t mad at me, although I still felt like a jerk.  Before you know it, we were back to laughing and making jokes after a few minutes, so all was well.  We made a deal to NEVER watch any wild life documentaries together ever again (bless you, Sir David Attenborough).  Funny enough, we made plans to go to the zoo on Saturday earlier in the week.  Avoiding the walrus exhibit at all costs.\\n\\nEDIT:  Reminder that we were watching the MAKING of the documentary.  A bunch of y\\'all missed that part in the beginning.\\n\\nEDIT Part 2: Apparently some believe all zoos are evil and are comparable to animals getting their heads bashed in by a rock.  Interesting.\\n\\nEdit Part 3: I appreciate all of the love and hilarious comments!  And then there is some of y\\'all that take this internet thing waaaay too seriously.  Yikes!\\n\\n***TL;DR***  I accidentally made my girlfriend cry by watching walruses fall from an 80 meter cliff.  We are going to a zoo on Saturday and are avoiding the walrus exhibit.  Sir David Attenborough is a universal treasure.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nArticle related to this scene:  [https://people.com/pets/netflix-our-planet-walrus-death-scene-explained/](https://people.com/pets/netflix-our-planet-walrus-death-scene-explained/) TIFU by ordering a book. \\n\\nSo, a few months ago I (24F) placed an amazon pre-order for a book that was due to be released in a couple months. I was in the process of moving, so I put my parent’s address down for shipping, not thinking much about it. \\n\\nMonths go by (I’m talking I ordered this sucker November 19th), and this week I get a notification that it shipped. Yay! I wait for it to arrive at my residence. And wait. Finally I check the mail again today with no book to be found.\\n\\nConfused, I check my account and find it was shipped AND delivered to my parent’s house. (Cue panic)\\n\\nI text my mom, trying to be nonchalant, saying a package for me arrived at their place and to not worry about opening it, but wanting to confirm it was received. Her response? \\n\\n“That came a couple of days ago. It was opened. 😂”\\n\\nThe book’s title? \\n\\n“Tell Me What You Want: The Science of Sexual Desire and How It Can Help You Improve Your Sex Life”\\n\\nKill me now.\\n\\nTL;DR: Ordered an educational sex book. Mom opened it. As usual, this didn\\'t happen today. This happened over 20 years ago and only recently am I noticing the impact. Don\\'t stare at the sun kids...\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhen I was around 11 I was fascinated by science, I still am. In particular I loved astronomy and the sun is a pretty cool object. I had heard that Galileo had gone blind by looking at the sun through a telescope, so you should never look at the sun. My intellectually curious mind noticed that when the sun is high in the sky, around noon, it is nearly impossible to look at without squinting or closing your ones. It\\'s very bright and the rays emanating from it prevent you from clearly seeing its edges as a circle. However, in the morning as the sun raises and soon after you can clearly see the sun is a circle and it doesn\\'t appear brightly. It seems you can look at it without any issues.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAs an 11 year old, I decided I was going to stare at the sun after it rose for as long as I could and see what happens, you know... for science. I did just that I stared at the sun after sun raise while waiting at the bus stop for school. It didn\\'t seem to be impacting my eyes at all. I tried to avoid blinking as much as possible, but of course I blink a bit. I wound up looking at the sun for approximately 12 minutes. When I looked away there was a clear grey/black circle in the middle of my vision where the sun had once been. What\\'s more the colors of things seemed to move around as my eyes looked around. The sky had a reddish color and the concrete around me went from room to blue. It was almost like there was a filter differentiating where the sky had been and a different filter where the ground had been superimposed on my vision. Those two filters and the black circle where the sun had been were fixed in my field of vision, and the color of everything I looked at was distorted by those filters. I can only describe it as what I imagine a drug trip to be like. Everything was funky colors because of the way their original colors were impacted by the filters in my vision. It\\'s similar to the negative photo optical illusion [https://www.verywellmind.com/the-negative-photo-illusion-4111086](https://www.verywellmind.com/the-negative-photo-illusion-4111086), as an adult, I have come to the conclusion that what I was seeing was the negative after image of the colors of the sky and ground that I looked at when I looked at the sun. This after image followed me around all day.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nWhat scared me is these filters (after image) and this black circle remained strongly in my vision past lunch. Then over the course of the afternoon the filters and black circle gradually began to fade and the world returned to its normal colors by the time I got home. If I looked at something fast enough or darted my eyes I could still see the dark circle.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nOver the years I forgot about this experiment and recently went to an eye doctor a couple of years ago because my vision has gotten blurry over the years. They took a picture of my retina and pointed out that my macula, I believe that\\'s the word, the point where light focuses on the retina appears to have had how amounts of light exposure for someone my age. They noted it down and said if it gets worse there could be problems. I thought immediately to that long forgotten experiment where I stared down the sun and it won.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIn the last year or so I\\'ve noticed more and more the black spot where the sun once was. I will quickly dart my eyes and see it for a second. The brain an the eye are amazing in the that brain will hide or fill in any gaps in the vision with information around the gap, similar to your blind spot, [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/brain-adapts-in-a-blink/#:\\\\~:text=A%20similar%20phenomenon%20called%20%22filling,falls%20in%20the%20blind%20spot](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/brain-adapts-in-a-blink/#:~:text=A%20similar%20phenomenon%20called%20%22filling,falls%20in%20the%20blind%20spot). Try this out to see what I mean [https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/eye-blind-spot#1](https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/eye-blind-spot#1). I\\'ve also noticed that in editing sentences I will miss a mistake, I assume because it was filled in my by my brain  making the sentence look correct. If I look at what I have written side ways out of the corner of my eye I catch mistakes easier. My personal belief is that my brain is filling in these missing details where the gap in my vision is, where the black circle where sun was would be if my brain wasn\\'t filling it in.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIt\\'s interesting how one stupid \"experiment\" as a kid can come back and reveal the stupidity of it years later. Always wear sunglass, never look directly at the sun even if it seems like you can, you are doing damage to your eyes.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: Yes, I blame the spelling errors on the blind spot. I read through the post 3x before I posted it (even the title) and there were many more issues before I posted it. None of them were intentional as some may believe. I will leave the spelling issues as an example of the how the blind spot effects me. Besides seeing the black spot every once in a while, my atrociously written emails at work are the main day-to-day issue from my \"experiment.\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: Don\\'t blame the parents. They told me not to look at the sun. Or blame them they encouraged my scientific curiosity.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: Many of you have asked about my eye prescription. I\\'m near sighted with astigmatism.\\n\\nRight Eye (OD): -2.50 -0.50 x 107.0\\n\\nLeft Eye (OS): -3.00 0.00 x 0\\n\\nI don\\'t have floaters or visual snow. I may have a mild form of night blindness. As the post implies I have a small sun sized blind spot in the middle of my vision.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: I intended on this to be a throwaway account so people that know me, didn\\'t know my stupidity, but the karma has far exceeded my normal account.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: For people that are wondering. I love science and do work in a STEM field.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL,DR: I started at the sun for 12 minutes 20 years ago. Now I\\'m discovering the effects of that day. I\\'m not blind but have a small sun sized blind spot in the middle of my vision that my brain has filled in. I don\\'t notice it unless I move my eyes quickly. Don\\'t look at the sun kids, no matter how much it seems you can look at it without an issue. Always wear eye protection. The sun is damaging your eyes even if you don\\'t notice it or feel it. This just happened this morning.  My wife and I are both working from home due to covid.  My wife, a marketing manager, has three direct reports.  We all get along quite well.  We all meet out for drinks, we go to each other\\'s houses for dinners, we\\'ve gone on vacations together.  All a fun close work group.\\n\\nThis morning my wife was sitting at the kitchen table having a zoom meeting with one of her reports.  They were talking and laughing, having a good time.  I went to the fridge and got a beef stick for a snack.  Looking to add to the work party my wife and her report/friend were having, I walked over to her and said, \"Here, choke on my beef stick\" and stuck it into her mouth as she was talking.  I started laughing, and I expected laughing to come from the computer screen.... but there was no laughing.  My wife angrily grabbed my arm and threw it away from her face, she then turned to me and gave me a horrible evil stare.  I looked over at the screen to see what her friend was doing....and it wasn\\'t her friend.  Wasn\\'t even anyone I knew..... Had similar voices, and looked somewhat the same.... but definitely not her.\\n\\nTLDR; Made a sexually charged joke about a beef stick and stuck it in my wife\\'s mouth in front of her work friend, but it wasn\\'t her work friend. This was a while ago, but I\\'ve only just now thought to share it with the People.\\n\\nMy husband and I were chatting, the way spouses sometimes do, about bedroom likes and dislikes and eventually the subject of our \"solo habits\" came up. My husband was really proud, because he said that he hadn\\'t watched porn in several weeks and it was helping his daily focus.\\n\\nAt this point I congratulate him and chime in with how I, too, had not watched anything in many moons. \"But it doesn\\'t really make a difference,\" I said, \"because I still pull up my mental spank bank all the time.\"\\n\\n\"Your what?\"\\n\\n\"Mental spank bank, you know, like you remember pornos you\\'ve watched in the past and visualize them to finish the deed?\"\\n\\n\"What on earth are you talking about\"\\n\\nAfter a great deal of back and forth, we discovered that my husband CANNOT VISUALIZE IMAGES IN HIS HEAD. Apparently there is a term \\'aphantasia\\' for this.\\n\\nI was totally gobsmacked and asked him dozens of questions to follow up. Apparently he always thought that when people said \"picture this\", they meant it figuratively. Apparently if I leave the room he can\\'t even picture my face??\\n\\nHe\\'s been low key bummed out about this ever since this discovery, because he feels like he\\'s missing out. At least now I know why he is literally incapable of finding objects in the house - he physically can\\'t picture the last place he put them.\\n\\nTL;DR Told my husband about how I visualize sexy things when I\\'m lazy, turns out his whole life he\\'s been incapable of visualizing anything at all. This happened last night, not today, but still less than 24 hours ago.\\n\\nSo my husband LOVES birds, all kinds of birds.  He thinks they are great.  He is especially fond of ducks.  Last night while he was in the kitchen prepping a snack, I thought it would be fun to change the desktop photo on his laptop (he had left it open on the couch).  I found a cute duck picture, made it his desktop background, set the laptop back on the couch, and made my way innocently back to the kitchen table where I had also been having a snack.\\n\\nMy husband finishes his snack a little while later and heads back to the couch while I remain at the table. He pulls his computer towards him and goes, \"OMG honey look!  Ducks!\" As he stands up holding his laptop and tries to come to me, he trips and falls over the glass end table we have, shattering it. If that wasn\\'t bad enough, he fell onto his macbook, smashing it completely open and crushing it.  If that also wasn\\'t bad enough, he also broke his wrist because of how he fell on it since he was holding the laptop.  \\n\\nI feel like a terrible person, but my husband still loves ducks.\\n\\nTL;DR: My husband got so overexcited over a picture of ducks I procured that he broke himself, a table, and his macbook. This happened all of 45 minutes ago, and yes, it still hurts a bit.\\n\\nTo start, some context. I always take incredibly long showers due to me getting sidetracked by random things, such as spinning in circles in order to get an even distribution of hot water, trying to scratch that damn itch, and the fascination that is my penis.\\n\\nAnother thing to note is that I always take a comb with me to the shower as I find it helps \"rub in\" the shampoo, except this time, there was a new [comb](https://i.imgur.com/MdY4S21.jpg) that I hadn\\'t seen before. \\n\\nNow that that is out of the way, let\\'s get into the Fuck-Up. My shower started off as usual, rubbing a bar of soap absolutely everywhere while trying to use my fingernails to carve designs into the bar. After about five or so minutes of soaping, I moved to the hair process, which also went as planned. This is where I dun goofed. Upon seeing this new comb, I decided to use it, as it had finer teeth. After using said comb, I realised that it also had a ^^much sharper/thinner handle. \\n\\n>The following actions have been made by a fucking idiot, and is NSFW. Proceed with caution.\\n\\nWhen I saw the handle, for some unknown reason, I built the thought process of \"This handle is so thin, I bed I\\'d be able to stick it up my ass and not feel it.\" Was it sensible? No. Was there reasoning behind it? Nada. Was it a good idea? Absolutely not.\\n\\nThat thought was immediately followed up with \"Why the hell not,\" which was then followed by a comb, of which I had never seen before, going into my ass. Now obviously, with nothing ever being in my ass before, there was a small brown patch on the end of the handle upon removal, and for some reason, I got the god awful idea that I should clean the inside of my ass. How, you ask? Stab the handle into a bar of fucking soap, of course. \\n\\nWith the handle now soapy, I returned to my ass and was immediatly greeted with a slight stinging feeling. \"Whatever, thats probably the soap cleaning away and is bound to only be temporary,\" I thought. I. Was. Wrong. The stinging only got worse once I pulled the comb out. I then spent the rest of my shower rubbing my ass in hopes to get rid of the feeling.\\n\\nFast forward to nearly an hour later and I am still feeling the consequenses of putting a hair product in my arse.\\n\\nOver all, 1/10, would not penetrate again.\\n\\n>TLDR: I stuck a soapy comb handle up my ass in hopes to clean it. Not a good idea.\\n\\n>Edit: Too many people are reading about me using a comb to sodomize myself, go away!!\\n\\n>Edit #2: My ass feels fine now. I\\'ve eaten a massive cheeseburger, however, so the visit to the bathroom later should be interesting.\\n\\n>Edit #3: A lot of you seem to be concerned as to where the comb came from/whos it is, which is so be expected since I forgot to specify that I had bought it a few months ago and only today found it again. No, thankfully, it was no one else\\'s hair product that became my booty stabber. \\n\\n>Edit #4: #Alright, who did it? Who guilded the booty stabber?\\n\\n>Edit #5: It was the soap causing the pain (the pain lasted less than 90 minutes), not the comb. The *buttfuck retarded comb abuser lives to shit another day!\\n\\n>**Also, the comb was mine, don\\'t worry. I had bought it a few months ago because of the finer teeth and had forgotten about it until now.\\n\\n>Edit #6: Yes, I have ADHD, and yes, it is treated. I am a happy, yet easily distracted curious Charlie! A little backstory: i’m a nurse (27F) in a small emergency room. Over the years you sort of gather a repertoire of things you say to patients, like saying “anything else you need right now?” before leaving a room or saying “little prick” as you draw blood/place an iv etc. \\n\\nSo one day a patient (approx 50M) comes in stating “i’ve been peeing a lot of blood”. We get a urine sample and it looks more like blood than pee so the thing to do in this situation was place a “two way” urinary catheter to wash out the bladder. The guy also needed iv fluids and most likely antibiotics so he also needed to get an iv. \\nNow when i walk into a room with a tray full of scary looking things i have little sentence i say: “i’m sorry theres some unpleasant things we need to do, but your cooperation will help things move along much easier and swifter” and then explain all the things i need to do and why. \\n\\nSo this is not what i said to this man. I walked into the room with my tray of horrors and he stikes up an immediate conversation so i couldn’t say “my line”. We talk for a good 5 min while i prep a sterile field, arrange all my materials and explain to him what is going to happen etc. I start to prep him for the catheter and suddenly remember i didn’t say my line. So there i stand, 26F nurse, with this guys penis in my hand and my brain comes up with “i wish there was more pleasant things i could do” as i shove a rubber tube up his junk. \\nHe had a good laugh and i turned the reddest i’ve ever been and profusely apologized. \\nHe told all the nurses and doctors about it and now i’m jokingly know as a catheter fetishist and can never quite live that down. \\n\\nTL;DR i’m and ER nurse and placed a catheter on a male patient and as i was doing that said “i wish there was more pleasant things i could do”. Patient told all my colleagues and i will never live it down\\n\\nEdit to clarify: i am 27 now, was 26 when this story took place. English is not my mothertongue, this dialogue happened in german where “prick” = “stich” which does not in any way mean penis, so something def got lost (or added) in translation Edit #2: I can’t handle all the requests to see the photos, so [here](https://giphy.com/gifs/middle-finger-mister-rogers-fred-44Eq3Ab5LPYn6). They’re not anything special. \\n\\nEdit: Jesus Christ. 1) I admit I was dumb and fucked up, yo. Hence this sub. 2) The officer said he wouldn’t have gone if he had other things to do, so I didn’t exactly waste his time. He said it was unsafe for a stranger to have the compromising photos of me so he understood why I wanted them back. 3) A boudoir shoot is actually a pretty common thing. It is not “porn” and I can’t believe some of y’all are defending this creep. \\n\\nThis happened a few months ago. Sold our entire bedroom set because we were getting a new one to a nice man in his 60s. He picked up, paid, and all was well. \\n\\nA few hours later he messaged me on Facebook asking if the pictures were of me. Holy shit, I’d forgotten to clean everything out of the nightstand, which still contained a boudoir photo shoot I’d given my husband for our wedding. \\n\\nHella embarrassed, I explained what he’d found and that I would be willing to meet him to pick up the album. Except now he starts being a creepy asshole and sending wink faces and saying he wants to keep it. The back and forth angry messaging was doing no good. He stopped responding after I threatened to get the cops involved. \\n\\nSo I call the cops and they say there’s not really anything they can do unless he starts actively harassing me; as I sold him the nightstand with the photos in it, they were technically his property. Eventually an officer went to his house as a courtesy to me and asked if he’d be willing to return the pictures, which he did. The officer drove to my place and returned them, saying the man was quite drunk and upset that I’d sent the police over. \\n\\nTL;DR: I sold a nightstand to an old drunk pervert with my semi-nudes still inside it and things got awkward. The police were called. My kid is stubborn as shit. He\\'s 3. He\\'s his own boss. Anyone who has encountered a toddler knows that they give absolutely zero fucks. My son? Pretty sure that kid gives less than zero, if that\\'s even possible.\\n\\nAbout 6 months ago, he started showing signs that he wanted to potty train. So we started by just putting him on the potty every 30 mins. No luck. We tried the \"Oh Crap\" method. Nope, didn\\'t stick. Tried waiting a month and trying again. Nope. We Googled a shitload of potty training tricks that didn\\'t help. We went to our (super chill) pediatrician who said he was probably ready and gave us some ideas, and nothing worked. My son, mind you, is a fucking beast of a child and most people think he is 5. He has outgrown the kind of diapers you can buy at normal stores, and we have to special order larger sizes that are expensive as fuck. So we had some motivation to potty train, although we didn\\'t want to force him.\\n\\nTwo weeks ago, I take him back to the pediatrician who asks about how potty training is going. I just looked up and said \"it\\'s not fucking good dude, maybe (son) is not ready yet. We might just wait a little longer.\" The pediatrician was like \"Well, you do you, if the little shit isn\\'t ready then he\\'s not ready. But hey, there\\'s one thing y\\'all haven\\'t tried yet.\" I know what\\'s coming. \"Hey listen, I know you\\'re trying to help, but I\\'m reading that giving a reward for using the potty is not cool\" and he goes \"I know I know but listen, you tried literally everything else, and your bitch ass kid still isn\\'t using the potty. I promise it\\'s okay just give it a try.\" (I may be paraphrasing a bit here)\\n\\nSo I go to WalMart and buy a pack of 250 gold star stickers. This fucking kid LOVES stickers. I\\'m not happy about it, but this is probably going to work, and I really don\\'t want to keep buying those diapers. I come home, and I figure I gotta model this shit so he knows what\\'s up. So I take him to the potty with me, do my business, and then I start cheering and clapping like \"YEAH SON I USED THE TOILET NOW I GET A DOPE AF STICKER\" so I go get myself a sick gold star sticker and put it right on my fucking forehead like hahaha look at \\nmy sticker you little shit. This kid gets all wide-eyed and I swear he started vibrating at the speed of sound like \"I WANT A STICKERRRRRR\" and I\\'m like yeah I got it! This shit is gonna work!\\n\\nSo right away he starts trying to use the potty. This is fucking great! First day he only has 1 accident. He actually uses the potty. I\\'m thinking why tf did I not do this shit sooner?! By day three this kid is a pro. Every time he uses the potty, he gets a sticker. Sounds great, right?\\n\\nSo then I start noticing that he\\'s peeing in small spurts. Like, just a little dribble. And way more frequently. I\\'m still giving him the stickers, because shit this kid is using the toilet and I like that, but I\\'m a little concerned that maybe he\\'s got a UTI or something. He\\'s acting all happy because we are cheering him on about using the toilet and he\\'s getting his stickers. I call the pediatrician who has us collect a sample and all that. We send it out and it\\'s all normal, but this kid is still only doing a little at a time. I ask if we can test it again, comes out normal a second time. This kid is still happy as a damn clam cause he\\'s got all these stickers. And then I realize.\\n\\nTHE STICKERS.\\n\\nThis little shit has been stopping himself mid-tinkle so he can get a sticker, and then going back and doing it again, all so he can get a shitload of stickers. I realized that this kid had extorted us out of the whole fucking pack of stickers in a matter of 8 days. He\\'s a sticker-loving genius. There are stickers everywhere. This kid\\'s got a golden sphincter gifted to him by the Gods. Holy shit, even just thinking about the level of sheer dedication required to stop yourself mid-piss multiple times per day, all for some goddamn potty stickers... I\\'m blown away. This kid is going to rule the world one day.\\n\\nTl;dr - My son has infinite willpower and taught himself to stop mid-pee so he could extort stickers out of us\\n\\nEdit: Wow, thanks for the gold and advice! Yeah we realized that a huge part of our fuck up here is the constant rewarding every time (hence, TIFU) and will be trying out some of the suggestions. We are so grateful!\\n\\nEdit 2: Nobody in the story actually for real swears at my children (myself included)\\n\\nEdit 3: I gave consent for rBangerz YT permission to use this story in a video One of my favorite things to do is go down on my wife. I have a talented tongue and I like to use it. Last night I decided to make that experience even more mind-blowing for my wife by grabbing the dildo and fucking her with it at the same time. Fun times were being had by all and things were getting very hot and very wet. Then my wife started to orgasm and my hand slipped and the dildo shot out of her vagina and directly into my right eye. I pulled away and she asked what was wrong. Not wanting to stop there I told her not to worry about it and I would tell her after. We finish and I go to the bathroom to rinse my face (and eye) and tell her what happened. We both are laughing hard at this but I tell her jokingly \"your vagina just gave me pink eye!\"\\n\\nWell, today my eye was red, itchy, burning, and gross. I just left urgent care with drops for pink eye. My doctor thought it was hilarious and burned my ass on the way out saying \"now go to the pharmacy for your vagina drops!\"\\n\\nI always thought my first lesbian sex injury would be a broken finger.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR - While going down my wife the dildo popped out of her vagina and hit in the eye resulting in pink eye.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: Thank you for the upvotes, silver, gold, and kind words to most of you. I\\'ve answered some questions about positioning, cleanliness, etc in the comments. Sorry if you feel like this wasn\\'t the right place to post this. I\\'ve had the account for a while, but just started really using it. Back to lurking! A few weeks ago, I was in my final class of semester, the night before the exam. \\nI am a student paramedic, and the mental health of our cohort is very carefully monitored by the school, for obvious reasons. \\n\\nAs the class ended, the tutor spoke to me to thank me for my effort during the semester, and to say she hoped to see my name on her class list. \\nJokingly, I responded, “They have a list for all the students that throw themselves off the church tower, right? Look for my name there!”\\nMost of us have a dark sense of humour in our field, and my tutor was no exception. She laughed with me, then frowned. \\n“You know I have to report you for saying that..”\\nI thought she was joking, and laughed again.\\nThe next day I was contacted by the university’s therapist offices to book my first mandatory session. \\n\\nTLDR: made a stupid joke, got stuck on suicide watch, required to do therapy this semester This happened two years back, still haunts me to this day.\\n\\nI was travelling alone in Japan as a backpacker and going from town to town. I knew onsen (hot spring bath) were a thing and very much enjoyed going to them as they were extremely cheap and I enjoyed baths much more than I enjoyed the showers in the hostels. And with that I tried going to as many onsen as I could.\\n\\nOne day one of the hostel staff i was staying at (in Osaka) mentioned the existence of \\'Spa World\\' an onsen on 5 different stories. Obviously I was extremely pumped and directly headed there as it wasn\\'t too far away. I only took a very small towel as is customary in onsens. At this point I also think it\\'s necessary to mention that men and women do not bathe together in the same rooms or baths.\\n\\nUpon arrival I got completely naked and headed to the many baths present in Spa world. As I went from bath to bath I started feeling uneasy as i thought some random guy was staring at me. I was the only non-Asian person present so i thought it might just be because of that. But even with me thinking that i started to feel really uneasy so I decided to go to the sauna room thinking \"If i go in there and that person also comes in I\\'ll at least be sure that he is following me, but other people will be in the sauna so it\\'s fine, what\\'s the worst that can happen...\" \\n\\nAnd with that I made my way into the sauna, around 5 men were present in the sauna so I was feeling quite reassured, and as I sat down next to one of them the person whom I thought was following me indeed entered. I felt quite uncomfortable, but other people were there so it was fine. But as he sat down literally all the other men took their leave, and with that my stalker and I were alone in the sauna.\\n\\nIn a matter of seconds he got very close to me and started small talk, he was struggling with English but he tried his best so I just answered to be polite. And then after asking me where I came from he asked me out of the blue if he could see my genitals that were covered by my small towel. At that moment I got quite concerned but the stupid innocent me thought he was just wondering what a European dick might look like, which would be understandable, and with that my extremely stupid younger-self took away his towel for a brief moment to show his dick. After seeing that, my stalker immediately asked me if he could touch it. That was finally the moment that I snapped and directly said no while putting back my towel on my genitals. He asked why I wouldn\\'t let him touch it and I just told him that I wasn\\'t interested and wasn\\'t gay. That\\'s when he told me that this specific sauna was actually a meet-up place for gays. I started getting extremely uneasy and got up to leave. And as I left my stalker CLAPPED my ass so hard that his hand was engraved on my butt for a while. \\n\\n In the end I left as quickly as possible and have never been to a sauna ever since. \\n\\n TL;DR - Went to a sauna to relax but some random guy tried to touch my dick and slapped my ass thinking i was gay. Happened yesterday at 2am. \\n\\nSo my wife was pregnant. I work from home in internet marketing so don’t get out too too much, but she heard of a cool local tech conference and thought I should check it out. (Important detail to remember)\\n\\nThe conference was 2.5hrs away in a neighbouring city. \\n\\nAnyway.  She was 37 weeks pregnant (babies are typically cooked at 40), and has been feeling great so didn’t see any issue with me being gone one night. Like, what are the chances?\\n\\nSo me and a friend packed up and left for the conference at 1pm Thursday for the evening networking. \\n\\nFast forward to 11pm, we’re having a beer before heading to bed after the networking is over, and I get a call from my wife:\\n\\n“I think my water broke.”\\n\\n“Umm.. what?!?”\\n\\nWe’re still 3 weeks early so I say no you’re probably not, go back to bed. Did some quick searches and Dr Google said that because she wasn’t having contractions, and she was otherwise feeling fine otherwise, it might just be pee from baby pressing on her bladder. No need to alarm. \\n\\n10 minutes later I get a text, “contractions started and they hurt like hell. Going to hospital now.”\\n\\nShe’s home alone and has no way to get to the hospital so is thinking of calling an ambulance, so my friend says his wife will go pick her up and take her. I tell my wife what’s going on and she agrees (she’s almost incoherent at this point and can’t talk or stand during contractions).\\n\\nMeanwhile, we grab our shit and hit the road. 2.5 hours, we should be able to make it in time for the birth. Labors usually take 6-12 hours. No big deal. \\n\\nShe gets to the hospital and they tell her that she’s fully dilated and baby’s already crowning. \\n\\nAt this point they get her straight into a room (too late for an epidural), my friends wife gets me on FaceTime, and I watch in the passenger seat of a car via FaceTime my daughter being born in record time. \\n\\nTotal time from water breaking to delivered child: 2.25 hours. \\n\\nI missed it by an hour. We get there and come cruising in and I got to meet my exhausted wife and beautiful baby daughter. \\n\\nSo good news, I have a beautiful, healthy baby girl, bad news is I wasn’t physically there. But she can’t get me in trouble because she sent me to the conference! \\n\\nTl;dr: wife sent me to a conference, didn’t think we’d have a baby that early, ended up having a baby that early and I missed it. Reddit, behold the story of the most embarrassing moment of my life:\\n\\nHappened last month during the school break, I was with my friends and we decided to make a bet, whoever decides to deepthroat a banana for 1 minute gets a pizza slice from the school café.\\n\\nI was the only retard to do it, and found out that I\\'m pretty good at blowing bananas, around 35 seconds in I hear the voice of my English teacher and I panic, making me choke hard on that banana, then I let out some weird sound that my friends describe as \\'\\'A chicken being strangled at midnight\\'\\', so yeah, teacher heard that nasty sound and thought someone was dying or something. She walked in just to see me with a banana half-way through my throat, I still remember her words \\'\\'Oh shi-\\'\\'.Locked eye contact with her then I managed to exhale that banana out, teacher acted like she saw nothing and just walked away, so fucking embarrassing.\\n\\nI try to forget this but it all keeps coming back when I see a banana, and I\\'m sure that teacher won\\'t see me ever again as the same student. But hey, guess what, I got my fucking pizza slice, and it was NICE.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL:DR; Made a bet with friends to see who deepthroats a banana the longest, I did it and got caught by a teacher who locked eye-contact with me then left like nothing happened.\\n\\nEDIT: I\\'m a dude, not sure if that makes it better or worse A few years ago now, my birthday, treating myself to an all you can eat sushi dinner. It was my first time at an AYCE sushi place that used the round based ordering system, which I didn’t understand. I was by myself and the waitstaff was busy and didn’t speak English very well so I didn’t get any clarification. So I ordered way, way, way too much sushi by mistake. I marked my ordering card wrong, not knowing how it was meant to be done. \\n\\nMy first clue was that the chef seemed a little perplexed by my order when I handed him the card, and asked if I was sure. But again, crowded, noisy, language barrier, the fact that I had ordered an unholy amount of food got lost in translation. I knew that there was a 15 dollar surcharge if you didn’t eat everything, but when I submitted my order I didn’t yet realize my mistake. After I got through round one I was immediately plated with a round two of equal size. Round one was a full meal’s worth of food, and now I had to start over, and had a third round to look forward to after that. I’d already ordered, it was too late, and I did not want to pay that surcharge. So I bent to my task and ate.\\n\\nAnd ate.\\n\\nAnd ate. \\n\\nI felt bad for the restaurant staff. I have no doubt they made a loss on me that night. I felt like the quintessential gluttonous American. Not only was 15 dollars on the line but my dignity was too, I had to save face or admit I was a sushi ignorami, and I wasn’t about to beg for mercy. \\n\\nI got through three quarters of round three before I simply could not swallow another bite. My arms literally would not respond to the order to put another piece of fish into my mouth. My whole body rejected the prospect of eating more. Thankfully the staff took pity on me and declined to charge me that fifteen extra. I wouldn’t have blamed them, the amount of food I ate. \\n\\nI left the restaurant literally waddling and with a terrible stomachache. Needless to say my time on the shitter the following day was not pleasant.\\n\\nTL;DR: Didn’t know how to order at a sushi restaurant, received three thousand calories of food, made myself sick trying to eat it all. This happened last night. My wife and I were settling down for the evening and sat down on the couch to watch TV while our 13-month old played on the floor. After a short time he apparently decided he wanted to cuddle up on the couch with us. He climbed up on the couch and crept up close to me with a smile and the lates his head down flat on my thigh. It was close to his bed time so I didn’t give it a second thought.\\n\\nWe were both really into the show we were watching when suddenly I felt a sharp pain on the top of my penis. I mean like a turtle had just reached out and latched on. I screamed in pain at first and looked down to realize my son had shifted his head slightly against the shorts I was wearing, and just chomped down. He may still be a baby but he has some sharp ass teeth.\\n\\nI grabbed him to get him off and my wife didn’t understand what was happening. She thought I was just randomly in pain and trying to throw our son. It looked like that, well, because he wouldn’t freaking let go. I finally tugged him away and to the floor and he screamed crying as my wife went to console him and I got up and cupped a hand to my crotch and paced back and forth with a feeling I’d never felt before.\\n\\nI walked outside to get away from the crying for a moment and stinging pain wasn’t stopping. After a few moments I returned inside and looked inside my pants to survey the damage. My penis was bleeding from the tip. He left a freaking indention with his teeth. Still hurts today every time anything brushes against it. I’ll be way more cautious going forward about where he’s laying his head. My wife later laughed and called him amazing birth control.\\n\\nTL;DR Let my kid lay on my lap and found out how sharp his teeth are. Now I’ve got a cut and sore penis. Technically, my fuck up was last night. Let me start by saying, I rent a beautiful home in the country on 200 acres of land. I have a horse, dog, and 3 cats. My horse lives in a field in my backyard. 6 acres of beautiful grass, hills, a stream, and a huge 20x10ft stall, all properly fenced.\\n\\nLast week, my horse bruised his foot and was limping. I decided to put up a temporary fence in my yard and keep my lame horse in my backyard where the ground is soft and the grass is greener. He could barely walk so there was really no concern over him escaping. He was beyond over joyed.\\n\\nYesterday, I had the ferrier come and fix his shoes as he was no longer limping. Here\\'s where the fuck up  begins. I loved having my horse in the backyard. It was like having a giant dog hanging out with me. So I figured, what\\'s the harm in one more night?\\n\\n6 am, my phone is ringing. It\\'s my landlord. There are 12 state trooper at my house trying to wrangle my horse who is leisurely strolling down the main road. He was fine, they had fun, my horse made friends with a super sweet lady trooper who was giggling the whole time she was walking him back home while he was nuzzling her face.\\n\\nNot nearly the worst of fuck ups but I thought everyone might enjoy something that doesn\\'t involve sex.\\n\\nTLDR: Treated my horse like a dog for a week while he was injured, only to have him escape when he felt better, causing a closed road and a bunch of state troopers a fun morning playing cowboy.\\n\\nEdit: Thank you for teaching me how to photo on reddit. Here are some pics of my ridiculous old man and the lovely property we live on. \\n\\nMy Old Dude, Stan The Man https://imgur.com/gallery/zeS4gso\\n\\nEdit 1: OH MY GOD! Thank you everyone for the gold and silver and all the lovely comments. I\\'m so glad I shared this. TIFU has been becoming a shit show lately and I just wanted to share some goodness with the community. Also, to those of you who think I need another horse, I promise you I don\\'t. He\\'s very happy with the peacock and chickens that live in his paddock. He doesn\\'t have any issues with running or pacing. He wasn\\'t out looking for a friend. A section of temporary fence fell down and he walked out my front yard. To start off this is my wife\\'s story and  it happened at the beginning of the year. \\n\\nSome back story we have 2 kids a 10 year old and a 2 year old. Why 8 years apart well me and the mrs tried having a kid for 7 years before she became pregnant.  So the 10 year old helps out a lot and is a great kid. We are truly lucky to have this child. \\n\\nWell at the beginning of the year the two year old had started to potty train him self. Telling us he had to go potty and then going potty. So we get him some pull ups and start that phase. We also have a 3 bedroom home and the boys share a room (the 10 year olds idea not mine). \\n\\nCue the day of said FU. The 2 year old had been playing in their room just out of ear shot of the wife. She would check on him every few minutes just to make sure he was all right. Well he comes to her and says (we think) mommie slim yucky. \\n\\nOh no my wife thinks and calls for the oldest. Hey, oldest the 2 year old got into your slime can you clean It up for me while I make lunch. So the oldest goes into the room to clean it up and my wife picks up the two tear old to clean him up. It\\'s at this time she sees the 2 year old doesn\\'t have his pull up on, and after a few minutes my oldest calls out, \"Mom! Can slime go bad?\" She walks into the room to she my 10 year old trying to clean up a huge pile of runny poo that is all over the floor with his bare hands. \\n\\nSo after a few screams and laughs from my wife she tells him to go take a hot shower and she cleans the mess her self. Then let\\'s him play on the switch for the rest of the day. \\n\\nTldr: 10 year old tries to clean up runny poo with hands thinking it was slime.\\n\\nEdit. Holy shit ( no pun intended) this blew up. You guys have me in tears laughing on my lunch break. Thanks so much. \\n\\nBut to answer a question or statement I have gotten in dms. No my oldest doesn\\'t baby sit but does help out around the house. Keeping his toys picked up and out of reach of the little one. Normally he does a great job. Is just one of said responsibilities.\\n\\nEdit #2 got gold? Thanks it means a lot. You guys have made my day. \\n\\nAlso my wife and kids did this DIY slime thing and at one part you add food coloring to make it the color you want. My son made his brown. Cause he added multiple colors. So when the little one runs in saying slime yucky it wasn\\'t a weird thing and he has gotten into it  before. My oldest wasn\\'t playing in it. He was trying to clean it up.  And the whole thing was over the span of a few minutes. So he wasn\\'t in there for that long trying to clean it up. \\n\\nAnd I forget not everyone knows things. But if you google Slime it should clear up confusion. [This guy](https://i.imgur.com/uU57bdj.jpg)\\nUsually Parsley is a **huge dildo cat**, always wanting food and pats, biting if he doesn\\'t get what he wants, sitting on my face, **big dick energy** without the balls.\\n\\nThis morning when I woke up later than usual he was not up in my grill wanting food, weird but okay. He\\'s sleeping curled up on the couch, when I say good morning he looks at me like - __- and gets up. Tries to jump of the couch, stumbles, lands **face first.**\\n\\nI laugh he gets up and he starts walking weird, not limping just uncoordinated. Usually he\\'s **pretty vocal** too especially when he\\'s hungry but he was **completely quiet**, his sister smacked him and he barely even **reacted**\\n\\nNow I\\'m **freaking out**, thinking he has a **blood clot or a brain tumor** or something. I book him in for an urgent appointment at the vet in half an hour.\\n\\nI keep an eye on him while we wait, at one point he tried to scratch his ear with his back leg and **missed several times.** When he tried to loaf he was sort of **wibbling wobbling.** He didn\\'t seem interested in food until I started feeding his sister, Shenanigans, but luckily he ate so I was feeling a bit better.\\n\\n**At this point I\\'m crying thinking the motherfucker is gonna die on me like a bitch.**\\n\\nWe take him to the vet, he goes into his carrier calmly without incedent which is very unusual. Vet tests his legs, stretching them out and rotating, nothing there. He often gets abscesses from fights but nothing like that. Vet checks his gums and teeth, his gums are a bit pale which is an **indication of onion toxicity which is fatal**. We\\'d had nachos the night before which has a bean mix with onions. I tell them he might have gotten some from the pan since we didn\\'t clean it up straight away. If the onion toxicity is bad enough he might **need a blood transfusion to save his life.**\\n\\nHe\\'s also slightly overweight and middle aged which makes him **at risk for diabetes** which can cause nerve damage when left untreated. \\n\\nHe\\'s kept at the hospital for the rest of the day for observation and blood tests. Vet gives me **brochures on possible household toxins** that are harmful to cats. I go home in tears thinking my cat might be **dying** and blaming myself for not cleaning up the **freaking nachos** last night.\\n\\nI read some of the brochures to calm down. I go through them thinking maybe he got to some lilies in a neighbours backyard or he licked bleach out of toilet. Then there was **the last entry.**\\n\\n**Marijuana. Oh fucking shit fuck.**\\n\\nMotherfucker I\\'d made some **super strong cannabutter** last night in prep for a Patrick swayze move night this weekend. That pot had a cup of butter and **a quarter ounce of hydro, simmering for 3 hours**. Parsley also **loves butter** and the smell of weed doesn\\'t put him off. \\n\\nParsley has always been **terrified of stoves** though, from when he touched it while it was on so he doesn\\'t go near them while they\\'re lit. I\\'d strained and refrigerated the cannabutter quickly after making it but I\\'d left the dirty pot in the sink over night. I decide to check it and\\n\\n**that bitch is suspiciously clean.**\\n\\nParsley isnt fucking **dying** he\\'s just high as a **god damn kite.**\\n\\nI have to call the vet and tell them my suspicions. His blood test came back negative for anything scary. He\\'d had **6 serves of chicken** while at the vet and **napped** almost all day, played with some dogs and snuggled with some kittens. Motherfucker had a **great time. **\\n\\n\\n**TLDR I made dank cannabutter, left out the dirty pot in the sink overnight, stupid cat licked it clean and had a real good time on my dime. I should charge him for it. **\\n\\nEdit 1: boy, this bold keyword thing is very contentious huh\\n\\nEdit 2: can now confirm after making caramels that the cannabutter is strong\\n\\nEdit 3: there were some people worried that I would be letting Parsley eat his fill in the future. I assure you I will not, I did say it was a fuck up after all\\n\\nEdit 4: Shenanigans and various cat photos\\n[Shenanigans and parsley ](https://i.imgur.com/EkK0cb3.jpg)\\n\\n[https://i.imgur.com/rtTRLWL.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/rtTRLWL.jpg)[Batcat](https://i.imgur.com/Ymm4Owg.jpg)\\n\\n[https://i.imgur.com/S7A4WdO.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/S7A4WdO.jpg)\\n\\n[https://i.imgur.com/XCW3vPS.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/XCW3vPS.jpg)\\n\\n[https://i.imgur.com/MqbRzVQ.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/MqbRzVQ.jpg)\\n\\n[https://i.imgur.com/EeM7G1u.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/EeM7G1u.jpg) This happened literally a few minutes ago, currently sitting in shock and burning up with embarrassment.\\n\\nSo thanks to all this quarantine business, lectures have gone online.\\n\\nWell, I was in bed like a good hour before this lecture started, just waiting on my phone to pass the time. One thing leads to another and I end up watching some...intimate stuff.\\n\\nAnyway. So eventually I get an email with the link to the chat room for my lecture. It\\'s sent half an hour early, so I opened up the link and decided I\\'d just leave the chat room open on my laptop until everyone comes in and the lesson starts, and in the meantime, I\\'ll continue watching...what I\\'m watching. See the thing about these lectures is that the default setting when entering as a student is mics off, camera off. I even gave a brief look at it before entering the room and was *sure* I saw they were both off.\\n\\nLecture starts, and I am just NOT in the mood for this class. I decide to just leave it on in the background to count for attendance, and I\\'d catch up on my own time later. Now keep in mind, I\\'m home alone, so of course, I\\'m blasting this porn at a fairly loud volume in my room.\\n\\nAbout half an hour in, the professor pauses the informational video they\\'re playing for us.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nYeah, my mic wasn\\'t fucking off.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTLDR: Was blasting porn while having a live lecture play in the background- turns out my mic was on and everybody heard.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT! \\n\\nAright y\\'all, few things I guess I should point out cause I don\\'t wanna keep repeating myself in the comments.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**1**\\\\- I completely understand how some of you find it hard to believe that the professor let it go on for a good 30 minutes. I will clear that up- they were basically talking a whole lot, and playing a couple of videos for us, all of which were at a fairly decent volume. My guess for what happened is that my mic wasn\\'t loud enough for them to have registered it as a separate source of noise until there was a lull in their speech. That being said, I don\\'t know if it was the same for the students. I\\'m hoping it was, obviously, because then the outcome isn\\'t so bad, but when you fuckup like that you kinda freak out and think up every possible nightmare scenario, ya know?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**2**\\\\- So, I was watching stuff for a really long time, yeah. But I wasn\\'t doing anything about it, if you catch my drift. Just to put a little perspective on the whole thing- it was a slow day, and I was browsing the internet going down one rabbit hole after the next, and somehow ended up at the stuff I was watching. This was after hours of going through other random stuff. It was purely a dopamine chase. I dunno- I didn\\'t realise that\\'d be hard for people to believe? But I think I can understand why, because I suppose it\\'s not normal for everyone to be dopamine chasing to that *degree*, and with the added taboo of the medium I happened to be browsing, it\\'s bound to turn some heads and raise some questions. \\n\\nSo, I know that stimulating your brain with dopamine is a thing everyone does, but I will mention that with ADHD it\\'s major amplified. Consequently, a lot of things come into play there- trouble with impulse control, being unable to pull away from sort of quick-burning dopamine... basically your brain drifting towards whatever\\'s most stimulating. I was kinda hyper-focusing on going down this rabbit-hole of obscenities, and I guess my brain just didn\\'t pull away from it when it needed to. I mean, obviously, lol. I\\'m not some pervert who gets off to watching porn at bad times, I was just \"hyper-focusing\" I guess and that\\'s the rabbit hole I happened to be going down. It could\\'ve very well been \"how it\\'s made\" videos or articles about snakes. Like, I was just going- \"Oh- that thumbnail looks appealing. No, wait, that one looks appealing. Woah, that one looks weird. Huh, the person in that thumbnail looks like someone I know. Oh shit, now that thumbnail is-\" sort of... ad infinitum. Until I stopped, of course. Your brain can kind of switch off its awareness of anything outside of what you\\'re hyper-focusing on with ADHD, which is kinda what happened here. It just unfortunately happened to be porn. Go fucking figure.\\n\\n**Now to be very clear**\\\\- I really *really* don\\'t mean to bring this ADHD thing up to try and gain sympathy points or whatever. In all honesty I don\\'t think I care enough about this post to go to *those* lengths, lol. I just thought maybe it\\'d help explain some of the behaviour that got me into this mess, since that seems to be something a lot of people are questioning.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnyway, sorry about that huge lame chunk of text. There\\'s probably a lot more stuff but this edit doesn\\'t need to go on any longer than it already has. It\\'s literally longer than the original post. I\\'m not even sure it helped at all, generally I do a pretty bad job at explaining things and for all I know I just made things worse, lol :P Thanks for the cool shiny awards! I REALLY didn\\'t expect this to blow up the way it did and now I\\'ve got Reddit premium for a month and I\\'m in like two exclusive subreddits on an account I probably won\\'t ever touch again.  Obligatory - This actually did happen today.\\n\\nMy family and I live in the sun-blasted hellscape that is central Arizona, USA.  The whole area is a hot, dry desert, and if you live outside of the city (as we do) it\\'s common to see relative humidity in the teens, and single digits are not uncommon.  For those who don\\'t live somewhere that\\'s anathema to life, that\\'s very dry.  Since we aren\\'t a family of kangaroo rats, we keep the air in our house comfortable with an evaporative humidifier.  Basically, a pump drips water on an absorbent pad, and a fan pulls air through that pad to blow out more humid air to the house.  It\\'s one of the full household-sized jobs that will humidify your air with twelve gallons of water a day.\\n\\nFor various reasons not apropos to this TIFU, the humidifier hadn\\'t been maintained well for the last few weeks.  Today I decided to change the filter and give it a good cleaning.  Possibly inspired by another recent TIFU, I also decided to attack the calcium buildup with a 1/3 vinegar solution.  While cleaning, though, I noticed a sliminess that made me think that there was bacterial growth.  \"No big deal,\" thought I.  Eventually a biofilm will grow on something that\\'s always wet, no matter what precautions you take.  I scrubbed off the biofilm, cleaned the calcium scale with my vinegar solution, and reassembled the unit.\\n\\nHere\\'s where the TIFU really starts.  Some parts of the mechanism aren\\'t accessible - they are in the pump, water lines, etc.  I decided to run my vinegar solution though for a few minutes to dissolve some calcium deposits in places I couldn\\'t reach.  \"But,\" thought I, proving that too much thinking causes trouble, \"there\\'s probably bacteria in there, too.\"  I figured I should add something that would kill the bacteria and what, I figured, is better at that than bleach?\\n\\nRight now, readers with some chemistry are thinking, \"Uh, dude...\" Yeah, I know.  Or, I should have known.  But I didn\\'t think it through, so I poured some bleach into the humidifier, followed by the remains of my vinegar solution, and turned it on to pump the mixture into the water lines.  Almost immediately thereafter, I took a whiff and started coughing.  At that point the little voice that remembered my college chemistry finally was heard.  Turns out mixing a sodium hypochlorite solution (like, say, bleach) with a weak acid (like, say, vinegar) creates chlorine and chloramine gasses, both of which are very toxic - like, they have been used as actual chemical weapons toxic, and I\\'d just put them in a goddamn distribution system.\\n\\nI immediately unplugged the humidifier and carried it to the bathroom, turned on the vent fan, and poured my ersatz chemical weapon down the bathtub drain.  Of course, the pouring process gave me another good snoot of the offending vapors.  So now the house is airing out, the wife, son, and dog are playing in the backyard for a bit, the wife is trying to mail back my engineering degree, and for the next few days I\\'ll be coughing like I\\'ve got the black lung, Pa.\\n\\nTL;DR - Tried to clean my humidifier, accidentally tried to kill my family trench warfare style.\\n\\nEDIT - Words\\n\\nEDIT 2 - Front page, neat.  It has been pointed out that there wouldn\\'t be chloramine, just chlorine - I think this story shows that chemistry isn\\'t my forte.  Finally, to those giving me shit for making sure to mention that I\\'m an engineer, I have to - if everyone doesn\\'t know, I\\'m just some guy with a lot of student loan debt.  Can\\'t have that.\\n\\nEDIT 3 - Lot\\'s of fake internet points AND my first gold!?  It\\'s almost worth the war crime!  Thanks! Mandatory this didn’t happen today, it happened Saturday night.\\n\\nSo me and my friends have a Saturday night poker game, and this time we decided to spice it up and play for money. We all brought in 100$ to  start. Now this is where I fucked up. I bought these new pair of aviators that I really liked and made me look really cool. So I decided to wear them to the game, which was inside. I hoped it would improve my poker face, which is lacking. It was also sunset, and the sun was hurting my eyes as I was facing the window. I proceed to have the worst game of my life. They knew exactly when to call my bluff and when to fold. It was like magic, I couldn’t get it. I went out super quickly. They continued playing until the end, and as we were leaving I told my friends “you guys have balls of steel!” My friends started laughing like crazy, and I asked them what gives. They said, “you know those glasses are reflective, right?” And I realize they could see every hand I had through my glasses. They laughed and handed me 50$ as compensation.\\n\\nTl;dr: don’t wear aviators to a poker game. You will lose a lot of money\\n\\nEDIT: added some more details\\n\\nEDIT 2.0: Super glad you guys found this story as funny as I did! For clarification, I was holding the cards in front of my chest and down to my stomach,  even sometimes I was leaning forward with my elbows on the table. It was easy for them to see them.\\n\\nThese guys are my best friends. They would bail me out in a minute. If I had asked, they would have given my money back. But because it was so funny, I let them keep it. I’m bad at betting anyway, and this was a special occasion (hence the high buy in)\\n\\nAlso mandatory RIP inbox. I’ll reply to as many comments as I can! \\n\\nEDIT 3.0: MAH MAN! Thanks for the gold! Guess this bambooz - I mean post worked! /s\\n\\nEDIT 4.0: This is so sad. Can we hit 30k likes? /s So this happened today but began a couple of days ago.\\n\\nLike a lot of you I became unemployed in March due to Covid.  I hate saying this but the time off work has been a blessing for me since I’m used to working ridiculous hours and a break was much needed.  I got to focus on myself and generally work on things that needed working on including multiple creative projects I have.\\n\\nWell, recently my steam has sort of run out and now I’m left bored and wondering what to do while waiting for that creative spark to reignite.  I’d like to get back to writing and drawing but unfortunately everything I’ve been making has been, for lack of a better word, poop.  So I figured I’d buy something stupid on amazon to occupy my time or revisit some old video games.\\n\\nI could buy the hot wheels set and race some cars but that’s expensive.  I could get some super soakers and start a war with my friends…but my state is sort of on fire at the moment and air quality isn’t great.  Then I see a laser pointer.  That could be fun to torment my cat with.  Added to cart.  But what else can I buy that’s cheap and entertaining?  Then I see it.  Googly eyes of all sizes.  The child in me lit up with the endless joy that this could bring me.  Oh the possibilities!\\n\\nI buy them and am content with my purchase.  They come in the mail a couple days later and I put them aside until I’m inspired to use them.  I can play with my cat and the laser pointer for the time being.\\n\\nSo today, I’m bored and texting my friend while they’re at work when it hits me.  I know what to do with the googly eyes.  I rip open the package, remove the stickers off the back and place them strategically on my nipples.  Take a quick video of me lifting up my shirt to reveal my creation and quickly send it while laughing the entire time.  This is not the fuck up yet.\\n\\nWe both agree I’ve officially peaked and I can never enhance my appearance beyond this point.   I’ve reached physical perfection.  I’m riding that endorphin train off the stupidity of my video and reeling in the ridiculous texts from my friend’s enjoyment of my creation.  But enough is enough and it’s time to take these bad boys off….except they won’t come off.\\n\\nThat’s the fuck up.  I can’t get them off.  It’s been a couple of hours and I’m starting to wonder what kind of glue was on the back of those eyes.  Now I’m just sitting around playing Jak and Daxter listening to them rattle every time I take in a breath.  I guess it could be worse.\\n\\nI may not be able to cook very well, I may not be handy around the house, hell I still have to count on my fingers at times, but my future husband can look forward to enjoying my googly booblies.\\n\\nTLDR – The world is sick, my state is on fire, and I can’t get these eyes off my nipples.\\n\\n\\nEdit - damn thanks for all the awards! I ended up getting them off with a little elbow grease and olive oil. Now I know what to do when I inevitably do it again :)\\n\\nHere’s me wearing the eyes the way god intended - https://imgur.com/gallery/88NlyA1 Preface: \\n*Not trolling for money, thanks* \\n\\n\\nSo I\\'m a semi-broke grad student and Lyft driver and this morning it was raining in my city. I ran into CVS to grab something and I was wearing an old coat with deep pockets (relevant to story). I also paid in cash which I never do as I rarely carry cash. So I walk out after buying my couple of items and see this older homeless man I often see in my neighborhood. I give him a dollar here or there some days when I can. He\\'s in his wheelchair looking helpless and getting rained on so I figure, hey, even though I\\'m broke (as in my bills are insane and I make just enough atm to live and support my family) I can still give my coat because I have a few decent ones, I\\'m dry in my car today, this coat is older but in good shape and will keep him warm.... etc... so I give him the coat and he mumbles \"thanks\" and I smile and tell him to stay warm and off I go... later as I\\'m working I stop to grab gas and realize I put the $80 change from that morning into my coat pocket without thinking. I would never go ask for it back (obviously) but I had a moment of semi- panic before I accepted that I just gave this dude all that money. Best \"screw up\" ever, I suppose. I\\'ll live. I have to be totally honest and say I was upset at first but I\\'ll get over it and it did make me stop and realize that I should be grateful for my blessings this time of year, no matter how broke I FEEL.\\n\\nHappy Holidays guy.\\n\\nEdit: to whoever gave the gold... I\\'m so inexperienced with Reddit I had to look up what it even was. haha. Wow. Really didn\\'t expect much response at all I\\'m honored. Thank you kindly.  So  my girlfriend has been working early mornings all week due to some  staff shortages, and even though we\\'ve been feeling frisky all week, we  haven\\'t had the time. So, when Friday night rolls around, we\\'re raring  to go.\\n\\nUsually, our dog hates being near  us when we\\'re rolling in the sheets (literally) because there\\'s nowhere  for her to lie on the bed. So, her thing is that she curls up in her  doggie bed and waits for it all to blow over before coming back onto the  bed for cuddles.\\n\\nSparing everyone the  details, the foreplay\\'s pretty good. Unfortunately, it\\'s a little too  good, as for some reason our dog starts getting concerned and maybe  thinks that our sounds are distress calls or something. She hops on the  bed and starts licking my gf\\'s face. It\\'s cute, until she decides to  start to lick mine.\\n\\nIn a fit of \"oh no I  can\\'t let her lick my lips because then I can\\'t kiss my girlfriend  anymore\" madness, I reflexively back away... and knee my girlfriend\\'s,  uh, nether regions in the process.\\n\\nShe  rolls over in pain, but she\\'s cry laughing, and both of us just are lost  at how absurd this has been. Meanwhile, our dog, oblivious to it all,  is having the time of her life as my girlfriend is dying of pain and I try my best to comfort her.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I didn\\'t get any last night. Will try again tonight, but I\\'ll keep the dog in her crate as a precaution.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR:  Our sex scared the dog, the dog scared me, I kneed my girlfriend in the  verguba, ruined the moment, and didn\\'t get laid :( This was actually a week ago, but the story starts before that.\\n\\nFor the last five years, I\\'ve had an ice cream tub full of sugar in my kitchen. I emptied it into the tub rather than have the bag spill sugar whenever I used it. I don\\'t use sugar a lot, so I\\'ve never had to refill it, I just dip into it when I need it.\\n\\nMy girlfriend thinks this is weird, and she thought it was weirder still when I packed the box to move with me when we decided to move in together.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t bring your weird five year old sugar tub, for fuck\\'s sake.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s perfectly fine,\" said I. \"Sugar doesn\\'t go off.\" \\n\\n\"It does,\" she said, wrongly.\\n\\n\"It doesn\\'t and I\\'m not going to throw out totally useable sugar.\"\\n\\nSo the sugar tub resides in our baking cupboard now, as a tiny point of pride. I want to see how long it takes for the sugar to run out. Maybe it will outlive me, at which point it will be inherited by my beautiful, supportive, wrong girlfriend.\\n\\n---o---\\n\\nFast forward to this past January. My dad dies suddenly and unexpectedly. He falls off the roof while fixing a skylight, a day before someone was coming to start work on repairing the entire roof - including the skylight. But that was my dad to his core. He didn\\'t know how to stop. He single-handedly ran his business - selling boating equipment and fixing outboard engines - for 47 years, a minimum of six days a week, until the day he died.\\n\\nI am not that person. I love stopping. I\\'m self-employed too, but I put the bare minimum in to survive and spend the rest of the time doing whatever I like. My dad couldn\\'t have lived like that. We were very different people, and that made his passing all the more difficult because now we\\'d never get any closer - the slightly awkward, stilted conversations I\\'d had with him in life were now all we had. That was as close as we\\'d gotten.\\n\\nFast forward again to last week, early June. We\\'re trying to sell his shop, but it\\'s a tip. Sadly, a couple of weeks before he died he invested around £50k in restocking the shop, and so the back shop is full to the ceiling with empty cardboard boxes. And the secondary room, his workshop, is full of tools, spare parts, half-empty paint cans and half-finished engines that haven\\'t been touched in at least a decade, very likely double or triple that.\\n\\nI get to work. Breaking down the cardboard boxes doesn\\'t take as long as I thought, and after lunch I start on the workshop. My dad specialised in Seagull engines, which are now collectible, so I\\'m sorting everything into Rubbish piles and This Might Be Worth Something piles.\\n\\nThen, at the back of a jammed drawer, under some oily rags and a grimy toothbrush, I find an ice cream tub. I open it up, and it\\'s half-full of sugar.\\n\\nThe best before date is from 1998. So he\\'s had this box of sugar since I was 12 years old. Maybe longer. For his coffee I\\'m assuming.\\n\\nI call my mum through from the front of the shop.\\n\\n\"Look,\" I say. \"Dad had a box of sugar.\"\\n\\n\"Why would he have a box of sugar?\"\\n\\n*\"Because its perfectly bloody normal, that\\'s why.\"* I take a photo to send to my girlfriend, hoping my smugness will come across without needing to caption it.\\n\\n\"Won\\'t it be out of date?\"\\n\\n\"Guh, no.\"\\n\\nShe doesn\\'t look convinced. I lick my finger and dip it into the sugar.\\n\\n\"Look,\" I say, \"It\\'s fine.\"\\n\\nI put it in my mouth, and know immediately that it\\'s not sugar. It\\'s bitter, and it\\'s bubbling, and fuck everything my tongue is burning. I run out of the workshop and take a swig of coke, swill it around my mouth and spit it into the street. I do that another half dozen times, but I\\'ve already burned my tongue very badly. One of my dad\\'s friends comes from the end of the pier.\\n\\n\"Everything okay?\" he asks.\\n\\n\"Yeah. Ugh. I just ate what I thought was sugar from an ice cream tub in the back. It wasn\\'t sugar.\"\\n\\nHe laughs. \"Why would your dad have had-\"\\n\\n\"I DON\\'T KNOW.\"\\n\\nHe walks in and comes back with the tub. It\\'s caustic soda, he says. For cleaning engines.\\n\\nI now have chemical burns on my tongue. It\\'s been a week, and they haven\\'t healed. I can\\'t eat or drink anything in the least bit hot or acidic. I told my girlfriend, and she didn\\'t even laugh. Apparently having an ice cream tub full of sugar isn\\'t normal.\\n\\n**Tl;dr: My girlfriend makes fun of me for having a big tub of old sugar. I find a big tub of old sugar in my late father\\'s workshop, and in a haze of validation taste it. It\\'s a chemical cleaning agent.**\\n\\n---o---\\n\\n**Edit:** Thank you for all the kind words about my writing. I\\'m cleaning the flat today, so checking back here is a real boost. \\n\\nDad used to give me shit occasionally for being uncomfortable plugging my work. So. If you like my writing style, and if you want to hear more, I have this piece about the Courtney Love / Kurt Cobain conspiracy theory which I\\'m really proud of. \\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/OPRDpg57M8o\\n\\nYou\\'ll like it.  [Posted as a comment in another sub, but just came across this sub and it seemed to fit.]\\n\\nA few months ago, I (overweight middle aged female) had the sweep out to do my chimney. Since we were social distancing, I sat on the edge of the sofa at the other end of the room. You know, the way you do. Legs apart, elbows on your knees, making awkward conversation through masks and over the noise of big vacuums.\\n\\nHe wasn\\'t much of a talker and I was a bit miffed with the whole experience, tbh. Felt that he was very rushed, didn\\'t do a good job. Just wanted to get out. New fella, youngster. Made a note to give him a bad review on google.\\n\\nThen, when I was going to bed that night, I discovered a massive split in my pants at the crotch. And no, I wasn\\'t wearing knickers at the time. Let\\'s just say that he got a stellar review on google for professionalism under extremely difficult circumstances.\\n\\nTL;DR Wondered why sweep was rushed. Turns out pants split and he spent 30 minutes avoiding eye contact with a middle aged vagina. Title says it all. I met her through Tinder, the condom broke but she said not to worry because she\\'s on the pill. Fast forward a week, where I see her for the second time, and she tells me that she\\'s pregnant. Boring story, I know. Now for the fun part. I saw self harm scars on her arm, but only on the second night (she insisted on having the lights off on the first night). She then proceeded to tell me that those were from her two previous abortions, where she was so tortured about it that she had to do this. And that now she probably couldn\\'t handle a third abortion and that anyways she actually knows how to kill herself this time. My heart fucking sank, man. She\\'s now coming over and will be here in an hour, so that we could continue talking. We barely slept because we were talking about it and she says she\\'s 70% sure she wants to keep the baby, but that she wouldn\\'t ask any help from me, except seeing the baby once in a while. I can barely believe what I\\'m typing right now. I bought two early pregnancy tests, the expensive kind. I don\\'t know what to do. Any advice?\\n\\n\\u200bTL;DR I knocked up a girl on the first night seeing her, the crazy came out on the second night a week later with the news, and she\\'s 70% sure she wants to keep it. Send help.\\n\\nUPDATE: Holy shit I dodged the biggest fucking bullet ever, I feel like Bullet Bill just zipped passed my cranium.\\n\\nSo she got here and just acted all cool, asking about my day and stuff. She then went on to explain how she felt all bloated and preggo and I just couldn\\'t believe the amount of bullshit coming out of her mouth. I cut her off and told her I didn\\'t believe in the timing of things (I had looked it all up before she got here) and said that I needed actual proof.\\n\\nHer being a nurse, she insisted that she had access to blood test that could detect HCG levels only four days after conception, which I knew was bullshit. She was so manipulative, she kept on saying that \"she\\'s in medical, so she just knows better\". And I just kept bringing up the 11-14 days period of time after conception needed to take a relevant blood test.\\n\\nIn the end I just told her that she was a bad liar and that her manipulation attempts were in vain. So I told her to leave, now. She called a friend to pick her up and then just stared at me, smiled and said that she would wait there, in my living room. And then the show began.\\n\\nShe said, among other things, \"Why would I ever lie about being pregnant, I\\'m 21!\" \"You should be ashamed of making me feel like a dirty slut!\" \"How could I even be pregnant from another guy, you\\'re the only guy I\\'ve been with recently\" \"Oh, by the way, I already have a son, I know how these things work\". Gems.\\n\\nHer still being in my living room, I told her to leave or I\\'d call the cops. She smiled the sassiest smile at me, so I did. After some more back and forth she eventually went outside on the steps while saying how much of a white guy kind of thing I was doing by calling the cops (she is half carribean half european, but basically black).  I closed the door with an intentionally loud sigh. FIN\\n\\nAnyways, thanks for the support everyone, it truly helped me.\\n\\n\\u200bUpdate #2:(Album) [https://imgur.com/a/LNdqtsS](https://imgur.com/a/LNdqtsS)\\n\\nUpdate #3: So I\\'m staying as far away as possible. Haven\\'t had contact with her since theses texts. Now for timeline clarification; we met for the first time last Tuesday, and again Monday night. She said she wanted to get a hold of me during the weekend to tell me about it, which implies a test on Friday, not even 72 hours after \"conception\". She then changed her story saying she got the test on Sunday to try to make it more believable timewise I guess. She insisted that she\\'s pregnant and that it\\'s mine. So she basically announced all of that to me 6 days after we first met. When I asked for her to take the test for me she flat out refused, citing disrespect on my part. Oh and the last kicker? Right before leaving she said \"That\\'s why I shouldn\\'t have told you, all guys react the same\". Now please refer to me as Neo. Happened over the summer.\\n\\nSo, we\\'re in the process of moving and I figure now is a good time to unload most of the stuff my wife and I have collected over the years- which is a lot considering we have children. Last weekend we had a pseudo-estate sale in which was staged in half of the house, driveway, and garage. Considering it was about 1,000 degree outside, I took the garage while my wife manned the inside post. Midway through the day, an elderly gentleman asked if he could you my bathroom- he explained he just took medicine and didn\\'t think he\\'d be able to make it home. Now, my wife and I had serious rules about this- our answer was supposed to be NO BATHROOM for customers. However, I had to make a snap judgement call and this guy looked very well put together. I also thought that he just took a water pill that lots of old folks are on and he just needed to take a quick squirt and we\\'d all be fat, dumb, and happy. But I\\'m not a complete idiot. I told him he\\'d better check with The Boss upstairs because of the aforementioned agreement. He chuckled and understood and away he went. 10 minutes or so later, I see him leaving. I figured all is well.\\nA few minutes after that, my wife comes down to the driveway glaring at me. I assumed it was because I shirked the responsibility of telling this old guy no bathroom and made her look like the bad guy if she said \"no\". I couldn\\'t be more wrong. Apparently this guy had a colostomy bag and it was chock full of shit. He tried to change it out in our bathroom and spilled the entire contents all over the floor and made no attempt to clean it up. He simply walked out of the bathroom and told my wife our dog must have had an accident. He. Blamed. My. Dog. Yes Reddit. Its here. For those just joining us, I must again apologise for this took place some time ago.\\n\\nIn my second last year of secondary school I was fortunate enough to participate in a volunteer program in East Africa over my summer holidays. The idea was we\\'d spend a month constructing new classrooms for a struggling school on the coast of Kenya, south of Mombasa and then work in a safari park (Shimba Hills IIRC) before crossing over to Tanzania for an actual safari in Ngorongoro Crater and then top it off with an ascent of Mt Kilimanjaro. This wasn\\'t free by the way, I had signed up for it a year before and had participated in loads of fund raising events to make it happen.\\n\\nWe had two teachers accompany us on the trip, Mr F who was a no nonsense former Royal Marine Commando as well as Mr B who was an absolute legend. Mr F\\'s girlfriend also joined us, she wasn\\'t a teacher but she had first aid qualifications. \\n\\nMr F utterly despised me and my friends who were, embarrassingly, the sk8r/st0ner contingent of the school, with long hair, band t\\'s, the works. To him we were useless pinheads and he sent us on all the worst jobs on the construction site. Mr B was more interested in ordering in crates of Kilimanjaro beer and trading albums with me (AFI - Sing the Sorrow for NOFX - So Long and Thanks For All The Shoes was probably my favourite swap). I wont digress too much but giving a band of Masai Mara warriors my CD player later in the trip and watching them do their leaping dances to NOFX was awesome.\\n\\nDuring our free time we had befriended the local villagers who enjoyed inviting us to their homes for food and trying to sell us trinkets, cigarettes and awful tasting home-brewed coconut wine. Eventually the most charismatic villager, a fisherman named Sayid stepped up to the plate and offered us some weed. We bought a stick off him for about $5 down in the mangroves thinking we\\'d smoke it later when the teachers were asleep but he insisted on rolling it up, pure, into a single huge spliff and we hopped in his little boat and he took us on a tour of the mangrove swamp.\\n\\n\"You like?\" He said.\\n\"Yeh its not bad, at home we smoke hash though, do you get it in Kenya too?\" I replied. Remember this part, as everything that happened later is contingent on this verbal exchange.\\n\\nDuring the boat ride I wasn\\'t feeling much, but then it suddenly hit me as we went back to shore: pure brain melt, watery bloodshot eyes, insane paranoia. Then the bell rang summoning us back to the camp. I was not ready. We tried to join up with the rest of the group as inconspicuous as possible, but likely looking as conspicuous as hell. Over the course of lunch Mr F kept on giving us weird looks, feeding my paranoia even more. Eventually his GF came up to us and said something like \"Boys, your eyes look a bit funny, what have you been up to?\" Cold sweats.\\n\"Its just hay-fever miss, the villagers took us in the long grass and the pollen got me really bad\".\\n\"It doesn\\'t look like that too me, I better not see you like this again or you\\'ll be sent home\".\\n\\nAbout half an hour later, two unexpectedly looking nice cars came down the dirt track leading to our camp. I didn\\'t give them much heed but they pulled up to the gate and about 5 or 6 of the scariest looking dudes got out. \\n\\n\"[My name], can you come to the gate, some people want to speak to you\" someone said, I don\\'t remember who. \\n\\nAs I was still high I started to panic again and the paranoia was back. I walked over to them. I\\'m not sure how the conversation went, but the scope of this most colossal fuck up dawned on me. Sayid had totally misunderstood me with his broken English. He had thought that I was asking to send hash back home and this was his lucky day and he could act as broker for a deal that would set him up for life, likely calling someone who called someone else and so on until the news had reached some senior guy from Mombasa who had come down to the camp to strike a deal. And listen Reddit, before you jump on me and call me an idiot and tell me not to travel, lets think about this first. In no way is this a reasonable outcome for the conversation I just had. Yeh fine, smoking on a school trip is never a good idea, but I was in the army cadets for 4 years and every trip turned into a smoke up after dark without incident.\\n\\nI think I managed to mumble some sort of feeble excuse like \"I\\'m sorry I have to go\". Then I ran and hid in the toilets and locked the door.\\n\\nAbout a minute later I heard Mr F yell my name.\\n\\n\"Where the fuck are you, you filthy little druggie\"\\n\"Where is he boys?\"\\n\"Hes in the toilet sir\"\\nSilence, then Mr F\\'s huge tree trunk arms pounding on the door.\\n\"You fucking little shit, what have you done? Who are these people? Come out here now\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t sir.... I\\'m on the toilet, its really bad\" This was sadly the best thing I could think of.\\n\"Get the fuck out here now\"\\n\"I can\\'t sir, its diarrhoea, really bad\"\\n\"You fucking little liar, open this door\"\\n\\nHe was trying to shake it off its hinges. I wanted to die, I wanted the ground to open up and swallow me, I was going to get expelled, my parents were going to kill me, my life was effectively over.\\n\\nAt this point Mr F\\'s girlfriend and Mr B stepped in, urging him to calm down.\\n\\n\"Let us talk to him\". \\n\"What happened, why are these people here\"\\n\"I\\'m so sorry, I was just talking about weed and he must of got the wrong idea, I have no idea how this could of happened.\"\\n\\nSomehow it was smoothed over, I don\\'t know how, but I stayed in that toilet for hours, fearing shame, mockery and punishment when eventually that door was opened. When I came out the dealers from Mombassa were gone. The teachers had searched all my stuff and found nothing which had further supported my defence. \\n\\nThe rest of the trip passed without incident. I wasn\\'t expelled, my parents weren\\'t called, Mr F was even nice to me after a few days, probably embarrassed about totally flipping out. Sure there were a few jokes but it was just too surreal to continually feel bad about. Also I think Mr B and Miss F had done me a huge favour by calming Mr F, coming to my defence and for that I am forever grateful.\\n\\nTL;DR a simple misunderstanding during a conversation with an enterprising Kenyan fisherman resulted in gangsters driving down from Mombassa to arrange terms with me for a hash smuggling operation back to the UK, temporarily making a teacher go berserk at me.\\n\\nEdit 1: Thank you again for all the feedback. It’s been great having this interaction as it’s been a lonely time on my road trip these last few weeks.\\n\\nI’ll try and post my Indian mishap on Sunday and round off the trilogy. \\n\\nOn a final note before I go to bed: Travel has really helped me with some serious issues in my life such as depression, anxiety and low self esteem. I’d like to create an elitism free space to help and encourage others to give it a go and share experiences, both positive and calamitous. If anyone knows of a suitable medium please message me (I’m not particularly tech savvy FYI).  \\n\\nEdit 2: I should of elaborated on this more but the library was closing and I was trying to hammer out the events as fast as possible on a proper keyboard. They were driving clean BMWs (or similar) in an area where most people didn’t even have a car, same goes for their clothing.\\n\\nThere was also obviously a head guy amongst them and he has a fair bit of jewelry on. Whatever he said to 16 year old me cemented the idea that he was a big deal in my head but I just can’t recall what.  So this didn\\'t happen today, but rather about 6 months ago.\\n\\n Im 19 and have some pretty good facial hair and as most men do when shaving, i tried different beard styles. First one was the goatee, then the cowboy, then just a mustache and finally ending up with the famous square. Unfortunately the trimmers battery died before I could shave it off so I put the battery on charge and left for a few minutes. I laid down in my bed and started scrolling through reddit when I realized I need some groceries. Completely forgotten about my face situation I went to the grocery store. I got some weird looks but didn\\'t think much of it. Maybe I just looked weird without a beard, I thought. Then right as I got to the cashier she said\\n\\n \"umm, I assume that\\'s a Charlie Chaplin cosplay?\" \\n\\nThen it clicked.\\n\\n\"Yeah yeah, umm he\\'s my biggest uuuh, insperation...\"\\n\\nI grabbed my stuff and left as quickly as I could and shaved it off. So maybe don\\'t do what I did.\\n\\ntldr: went to shave, battery died, went to the grocery store, accidentally became a nazi charlie chaplin.\\n\\nEdit: a lot of comments pointed out how I should\\'ve worn a mask, but as I said in the first sentence, this was roughly 6 months ago, before corona and quarantine :)\\n\\nEdit 2: To everyone saying this is bullshit or fake, why would I want to fake this? Karma? I really couldn\\'t care less about virtual internet points. It\\'s something I did that I thought others would enjoy, so I shared it. Obligatory this didn\\'t happen today.. It happened about 23 years ago but it was my first traumatic cringe. \\n\\nI was twelve. Picture what it would look like if Wednesday Addams really was genuinely dying to get into the Babysitters Club. Yup that\\'s me. Having my second period ever, complete with Satan\\'s tsunami of pain and fuckery happening to my insides. \\n\\nMy family decided this is when were going to go visit Mammoth Cave National Park. I\\'m still in that stage when I\\'m embarrassed by my period/ sure that everyone everywhere just KNOWS it\\'s shark week for me. \\n\\n(We\\'re traveling light by my parents insistence so when I need a pad it\\'s off to hassle dad to dig one out of his fanny pack and make the mortified trek to the bathroom. That\\'s it\\'s own tween trauma. )\\n\\nWe\\'re taking the cave tour and in one of those really tight places with a horrible name like \\'Fat man\\'s death\\' and all hell is brewing in my gut. Audible growling like hellhounds begging to be freed, loud enough for the people next to me to get that shifty eyed wtf look. \\n\\nAt the time I\\'m 4\\'11\" maybe a hundred lbs and all that stands between the world and the nuclear bomb in my gut is THE CLENCH. \\nI clenched you guys. I clenched through so much of the longest cave system in the world (Google it) and I just couldn\\'t fuckin do it anymore. I fell victim to the oldest myth we tell ourselves... Just let a lil out. Just a little and I\\'ll feel so much better....\\n\\nSo I did...And I didn\\'t. I cracked the door, but all the demons escaped. What came out was the most inexplicably silent fart accompanied by the most rancid smell I\\'ve ever smelled. \\nThe kind that immediately makes you think it couldn\\'t possibly have come from your own body... Or any living body. \\n\\nImmediately there was shuffling as it hit the polite people around me and they tried to avoid overly embarrassing the green skinned little girl with the demon gut it had to have come from. \\n\\nThis is where my mother comes into play. There\\'s one thing you must know about my mother.  Her name is Karen. *Legend has it she is the original*. If I had a dime for every manager spoken to while her family sat red faced, pleadingly apologizing with their eyes (blink twice for help) I\\'d be a Scrooge McDuck rich. \\n\\nSo here we are stewing in rancid hellfire corpse level stank and my mother asks the poor teenage tour guide (who is trying not to gag) \\'Are there Sulfur deposits down here? I smell sulfur.\\' \\n\\nSilence. \\nA few discreet glances at the miserable little girl from polite strangers. \\n\\n\\'No ma\\'am, no sulfur in this part of the cave system.\\'\\n\\nMy mother is never wrong. Not even when she\\'s wrong. She insists...\\'That can\\'t be right. I smell sulfur.\\n\\n\\'No ma\\'am. No Sulfur.\\'\\n\\nIf there was a manager nearby we\\'d have already been speaking to them. She\\'s getting very upset because she\\'s obviously RIGHT she obviously smells Sulfur and this ridiculous teenager doesn\\'t know what the hell he\\'s taking about. \\n\\nThe back and forth goes on. Forever. Her insistence that she\\'s right keeps ratcheting up. That poor bastard. \\n\\nTo his credit he glanced at me, and did the kindest thing that kept me from just completely shriveling up and dying on the spot. \\nHe plastered a queasy grin on his face and said, \\'You know what ma\\'am maybe there\\'s is Sulfur down here I\\'m going to double check on that as soon as we get back. Maybe I\\'ll learn something new today.\\' \\n\\nThe cringe was so full on I don\\'t remember anything else about that day. It\\'s a blank. \\n\\nOn that fateful day I learned never to trust a fart, that cringe that deep in the early tweens leaves a little scar tissue on your soul, and that the kindness of strangers is a very real thing.\\n\\nTL:DR Let out hellacious silent fart in confined space in a cave system prompting the ORIGINAL Karen to demand poor teenage tour guide get up to date on his knowledge of Sulfur deposits. I turned 43 today. With my husband working abroad, I woke up alone on my birthday for the first time in however many years. It didn’t help that I barely slept last night (it was hot and sticky so I ended up sleeping in my birthday suit). As you can imagine, I was feeling rather lonely so I decided to treat myself to a little morning pleasure.\\n\\nJust as I was getting into the rhythm of things, the door swung open and my son rushed in wishing me a happy birthday. Needless to say I panicked and the ensuing carnage resulted in the lovely birthday breakfast he made for me ending up on the floor. Luckily, his younger brother didn’t see anything (he told him mummy isn’t dressed).\\n\\nAll I could think was, wow! What a great start to my 43rd year! I feel really bad about having tainted the wonderful surprise the boys planned for me. I really should have been more prepared (they always rush in to wish me a happy birthday). I guess I just miss my husband. I can’t think straight without him.\\n\\nTL;DR Woke up this morning feeling lonely and a little horny so I decided to treat myself to a cheeky birthday pleasure sesh. Sons brought me an amazing birthday breakfast that sadly ended up on the floor (my eldest son saw a lot more than he bargained for). Overall, what a great start to my 43rd year, right? **Update** I\\'m hoping that no news means good news. We haven\\'t heard anything suggesting that my ex\\'s sister overheard us, though it\\'s possible she\\'s just keeping it to herself.\\n\\nObligatory this happened last night. Using a throwaway account because friends/family are aware of my main account.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I broke up in the early summer - and we\\'ve been sort of off and on then. Our friends and family are largely unaware that we have been in touch. Recently, we\\'ve been sexting more and sometimes having phone sex.\\n\\nLast night was one of those occasions. I was setting the mood with some in-depth foreplay. I spent several minutes describing how and where I would lather massage oil on her, and then got into detail about some of the kinkier sex stuff we would sometimes start with. \\n\\nAs I was explaining, she was obviously pretty quiet, and I thought this was because I was doing a good job setting the mood. I suddenly heard a crashing sound, followed up by some loud breathing and my ex screaming \"fuck!\" a bunch of times.\\n\\n\"Is everything alright?\" I asked?\\n\"My phone Bluetooth connected to the car, I lost you for a few minutes.\"\\n\\nA few minutes????\\n\"Who\\'s in the car right now?\" I asked.\\n\"My sister\".\\n\"Did I just describe to your sister in excruciating detail that I wanted to lather her in oil and eat her ass out?\\'\\n\"I think so...\"\\n\\nNeedless to say the phone sex abruptly halted there. \\nHer sister is gone for the next three days so we have no idea if or what she did/did not hear. I am absolutely mortified. I will update this post if I find out what happened.\\n\\nTL;DR My ex girlfriend\\'s phone connected to her car\\'s Bluetooth speaker when her sister started the car, right when I was talking about lathering her in oil and eating her ass.\\n\\nClarification 1: All these \"you\\'re in\" comments would make more sense if my life was the set up to a porno. This is not one of those situations - accidentally being privy to a private conversation is not consent from either party. Please learn about sex from somewhere other than Pornhub.\\n\\nClarification 2: You\\'re entitled to your opinion on whether it\\'s a good idea to be in contact with your ex, but the purpose of this post was to share a story relevant to this sub, not to put my relationship under the microscope. Don\\'t be surprised if I ignore your unsolicited advice.\\n\\nClarification 3: Please learn how Bluetooth works. My ex\\'s sister started the car mid conversation, the car was roughly 30 feet from my ex\\'s bedroom. My ex was not standing next to the car (Bluetooth range is pretty strong) and my ex\\'s sister wasn\\'t privy to the entire conversation from the beginning - only from when the car connected to the phone via Bluetooth. After getting tired of shoving bits of cotton in my \\'nanner curtains for years, I switched to the menstrual cup a while back. *For those that don\\'t know, it\\'s basically this little silicone cup you pop into your lady bits and you can wear for like 12 hours.*\\n\\nAnywhoo, after sleeping all night, I needed to empty it. I headed to the bathroom, lined the toilet with toilet paper to prevent splash back, and proceeded to remove it. Now, I always look to see how full the cup is after removal. It\\'s a weird thing to do, but I think it\\'s kinda cool to see how much is in there. \\n\\nApparently, unbeknownst to me, my bathroom spider bro was also interested in my red water tidings. As I was removing the cup, he dropped down to check out the situation. Not expecting a spider to the face that early in the morning, I jerked back, shrieked, and fell off the toilet.\\n\\n Remember what was in my hand? Yeah, It was a full cup. **Everywhere.** On the tub, on the wall, all over me, it was a mess.\\nNaturally, my SO heard me yell, and the thud of my lard ass falling off the toilet and came running, only to find me on the bathroom floor, covered in blood, yelling about a spider. I\\'m surprised the poor guy didn\\'t faint.\\n\\nTL;DR: A spider surprised me, I threw blood everywhere and my SO thought I was dying.\\n\\nEdit: Holy shit guys, I wasn\\'t expecting this many responses! For those asking, my mom came up with the nanner curtains thing and it stuck lol, and spider bro has retreated to his corner of the bathroom. Also the boyfriend is fine, slightly traumatised, but he\\'ll live. My daughter had her friends around today for the first time in a while. I was in the shower when they arrived. When I came out and heard they were here, I quickly towel dried my hair and slid on a dress so that I could go say hello.\\n\\nI went outside to the garden to have a quick chat with the girls. All of a sudden, a violent gust of wind came and blew my dress up. I quickly found myself struggling to pull it back down. In the chaos, I could see that my daughter was mortified.\\n\\nObviously I made a hasty retreat back into the house. I waited until the girls were leaving then came downstairs to wave them off and apologise for my little mishap. Needless to say, my daughter was furious with me.\\n\\nHer brother heard the commotion and asked what I did this time (apparently I have a habit of being embarrassing). “Oh, nothing. Mum just flashed her hairy fanny at them.” He found it hilarious and says he wishes he could have seen it (referring to the incident of course). My daughter said “Trust me. You really don’t...” and slammed her bedroom door.\\n\\nTL;DR Got out of the shower and rushed down to greet my daughter’s friends. A gust of wind blew my dress up and I wasn’t wearing knickers so they all saw my vag. I jokingly apologised to them as they left but my daughter was still angry at me and told my son what happened. He found it hilarious. Daughter wasn’t amused by this and stomped off in a huff. Normally when I go to bed I put my girlfriends cat in the spare bedroom. It is always getting into crap it shouldn\\'t so we like to make sure it can\\'t break anything while we sleep. Last night he was being extra calm and sweet so my girlfriend convinced me to let him stay out as a \"treat\" for good behavior. I woke up in the middle of the night because I had a dream about peeing and we all know where that leads. But as soon as I woke up I smelt a horrible smell (to groggy at the time to realize what it was) and I was very short on breathe. Turns out he somehow turned the gas on the stove on and tried to kill us in our sleep. So this was an ongoing fuck up that occurred over the past year and a half.  We ran out of laundry detergent and my wife and I separately stopped at the store (we both didn’t know the other was stopping) and bought some. (Edit: we both bought the same thing) \\n\\nSo that’s the laundry detergent I’ve been using to wash everything for nearly a year and a half. Clothing, towels, sheets etc. all of it. I basically grabbed each bottle of detergent in turn so they both lasted forever \\n\\nFinally both bottles hit empty about a week ago and I dragged my ass to the store because I needed clean towel. I head to the detergent section and grab the same bottle I’ve been using for a year an a half (free and gentle. I don’t like scented stuff) \\n\\nThat’s when I freeze. Because the bottle I’m holding, the same type of bottle I’ve been using for a year and a half... well I didn’t grab it from the detergent section and it didn’t say detergent on it.   \\n\\nNo that bottle said fabric softener. Not laundry detergent. No soap or cleaning agent that I’m aware of. None.   For a YEAR AND A HALF I’ve been softening the hell out of my clothing but not actually using detergent. \\n\\nI didn’t want to believe it.   Ran back to the laundry room at my apartment where the trash hasn’t been emptied and check the old bottle.   Fabric softener. \\n\\nI’m in shock. My wife has been complaining about the towels smelling for months and I thought it was in her head (I have a terrible sense of smell anyway but I knew I was washing the towels regularly) turns out I haven’t washed those towels with detergent since we bought them.    She wondered why her whites always seemed dingy even when freshly washed.   Well now we know.   Because FABRIC SOFTENER... \\n\\nSo now I’ve been washing everything I own and holy shit what a difference it makes when you actually use detergent. \\n\\n\\n\\nTL:DR I used fabric softener instead of laundry detergent for a year and a half, now I feel dirty and have to wash everything in my closet \\n\\n\\nEdit: a proper TL:DR\\n\\n\\nEdit:   A lot of you are overusing detergent.  Check the cap. The fill line for a load is usually a half inch or less above the bottom of the cap, not the top. (I see the irony of me saying this but read the label. It’s pretty clear how little you actually need) \\n\\nEdit3: for fucks sake people, stop telling me to not use fabric softener on towels. I DIDNT THINK I WAS! So, these 5 girls asked me to come and hang out with them in their pool. \\nI thought it was gonna be a little party, but no. It was just me and 5 ladies in a pool. Sounds like a every mans fantasy, right? \\n\\nWrong. \\n\\nI was invited over to start up a fire pit because \"I can\\'t do it myself\". \\nSo, I ask \"having a pool party, huh? Yea, I can do that!\" I get a reply \"yea, a party, sure!\" \\n\\nRed flag one. So, I take my happy and hopeful ass over to this house where the \"party\" is at. \\n\\nRed flag two, the fire pit is already a\\' blazin. \\n\\nI didn\\'t think much of it, but I also noticed that only 5 girls in a swimming pool is kind of a small party, but I\\'m not complaining. I settle in, have a few drinks, hop in the pool and hang out with these ladies and all seems well.... then the night actually started to take off...\\n\\nOne of them got super wasted, stripped down naked and was running around the house hysterically crying, while we tried chasing her down so we could clothe her. Funny thing was, she was the only girl I didn\\'t see drink alcohol. \\nAnd like a brick wall showing up while your doing 90+ in you car, BAM she was blitzed. Then, Another girl looked at me at one point and said \"come here, I gotta tell you a secret\" So, I swim semi-drunkenly over to hear her little secret, but instead she kisses me. I\\'m thinking, \"okay not what I expected but I ain\\'t mad.\" \\n\\nAs I go to kiss her back I hear, in an extremely angry tone, \"What the FUCK?!\" One of the other girls (the one who invited me) saw it and was irate.\\nShe swims over to us, and I\\'m thinking that I\\'m about to be castrated, but my presence doesn\\'t phase her, she moves straight to her friend and grabs her by the shoulder and a fistful of hair, and drags her out of the pool and onto the grass. \\nThey start fighting, like literally throwing fists and tackling each other on the ground, UFC style. \\n\\nBut, in the blink of an eye, they stop and starting hugging each other and crying like they just saw some cheesy romantic movie with a predictable ending. I\\'m thinking to myself \"what the fuck. Should I be aroused or terrified?!\" \\n\\nI assure you, I was both.\\n\\nAfter that, shit got scary. They threw me into the pool, and were trying to play some wrestling game, so they held me down. Now, I grew up with sisters who were rowdy, so I know how to push a lady whose trying to kill off me, but 5! IN THE DEEP END OF A POOL WHILE DRUNK. That shit got me praying to every God in every religion. I wasn\\'t sure if they were trying to kill me, or got caught up in the moment, I was just trying to stay alive, man. Their \"playful\" laughter is something that will haunt me until my dying days. I thought it was the last thing I\\'d ever hear. \\n\\nThen things kinda settled down, so I, cautiously and reluctantly, stayed the night on the couch because I had too much to drink and I\\'m not trying to get a DUI or wreck my motorcycle. \\nBut I woke up to this god awful sound, like a beast was chowing on its prey, and I thought \"aw fuck. This is it. These ladies are a coven of witches or demons and my soul is due for atonement. MY LUST, MY GREED, I DESERVE THIS.\" So, I flip around to better see what\\'s happening, and the previously naked hysterically crying girl was vomiting everywhere. I mean really going at it. Like a fire hose. \\n\\nThen, after painting the floor with a fucked up rendition of Blue Poles by Jackson Pollock, she looks at me and says \"sorry, didn\\'t mean to wake you\" and walks away. Like it was nothing. Then, I just closed my eyes in bewilderment, and waited until I was sober. And I got the fuck out of there.\\n\\nTLDR; hanging with 5 girls in a pool sounds like a dream, but it\\'s actually a nightmare and they will get naked and try to drown you. This morning I fell asleep on the plane while watching a movie on my laptop. Explosions and screeching tyres were blaring through my headphones and yet I still managed to dose off somehow. No offense, Hobbs & Shaw. \\n\\nI\\'m not sure how long I was sleeping, but it appeared to be long enough for my media player to go rogue and autoplay the one movie in my library the world was never meant to see. I woke up to one of the flight attendants gently tapping me on the shoulder and discreetly asking if I didn\\'t mind watching something \"more appropriate\" for the sake of the other passengers.\\n\\nAt that moment I realized my laptop was playing a home video I added recently. A *private* home video, starring yours truly. It was footage of drunk me squatting on the floor completely naked with my hands over my ears while trying to convince the person behind the camera I was [psyduck](https://www.deviantart.com/emerald-stock/art/Free-Psyduck-Pokemon-Vector-466845215) in human form. I know, I too wanna unread that sentence. This happened two days ago in my apartment. My equally shit-faced roommate was the one filming me. \\n\\nYesterday my roommate sent me the video under the caption: \"two pokéballs, one duck\". And just a few hours ago, that video was accidentally viewed by a visibly traumatized flight attendant and an elderly couple sitting next to me. I shut my laptop and apologized. But the damage was done. My penis had gone public. I could no longer look anyone on that plane in the eye. \\n\\n**TL;DR Fell asleep on the plane while watching Hobbs & Shaw. Woke up and realized Hobbs & Shaw had turned into an uncensored pokémon movie starring me, as psyduck, for all to see.** A few nights ago before bed, I opened an incognito tab and used a website that should be closed immediately after. I guess I was tired so I accidentally minimized the tab instead and went to bed. A few days went on and I hadn’t used my laptop (my clinical job doesn’t usually require it) but yesterday I had a council meeting and had to present some work I’d been writing for the unit. I walk into a small conference room with all my managers and their bosses, ready to present. My direct manager is to my left and to my right is a guest manager from another unit. As I get ready to share my work and open my laptop, open to Word, everything looks fine. I present and everyone loves the ideas, etc. and my boss asks me to write her an email summary of what I presented. I then go to click on my google app and out pops a black and orange screen with obscene scenes being portrayed. Cue blushing and panic. I close it as quickly as I can and look over to my left with my direct manager who seems to be focused on something else so okay we’re fine I think but then I look over to my right and the guest manager is trying to look anywhere but at me... completely red. I play it off as nothing happened and finish the meeting as best as I can but you can feel the awkward energy radiating from her. Hopefully I never have to apply for a transfer to her unit... or see her again!!! \\n\\nTL;DR Was giving a presentation in a board room full of managers and opened an inappropriate website in between two of them. My immediate manager didn’t see but the guest to my right turned red and avoided eye contact at all costs for the rest of the meeting. A couple years ago, I had a nightmare. A real bad one. One of the kind that sticks in your mind for quite some time after you\\'ve woken up. It was some time after Casino Royale came out. You know, the one with the torture scene in which Daniel Craig is tied to a chair while naked. My nightmare was more ore less this exact situation.\\n\\nSo there I was, naked and tied with arms and legs to a char. My torturer was using all kinds of methods to make me tell him some secret. Heat, cold, beating me, electric shocks, you name it! But nothing worked. I didn\\'t break! I could see the frustration in the man\\'s eyes and then the little sparkle when you know somebody has had a sinister idea. With great speed, he grabs hold of my balls, and with a vice-like grip starts to squeeze. I panic!\\n\\nThis shock is enough to push me over the edge to being awake. The last fragment I remember from the dream is that with a great effort of strength I manage to break loose with one arm from the ropes holding me to the chair. Unfortunately I haven\\'t yet registered it is a dream, and in my newly awoken state I have a bit of a hard time realising what is real and what is not. The only thing I know is that somebody has my balls in their hand, crushing them, and that hand has got to go away, right now!\\n\\nSadly, The fine motor skills after a rough wake-up is not entirely up to par. Also the fact that there is nothing to slow down my hand racing towards my scrotum makes the impact even worse. I smack myself, right in the balls, with quite some force. As I lie there groaning from the impact the realisation dawns on me, It was just a dream. I lie a little while in the bed, too hurt to move, feeling stupid and embarrassed. After some time I get out of bed. There\\'s just no way to go back to sleep after this.\\n\\nTLDR; Had nightmare, woke up in the middle, smacked my own balls. Two days ago I got my first dildo. Since I still live with my parents, I obviously had to hide the the sinful monstrosity. Where would be the best place to hide a sex toy? Perhaps up high in the corner of my closet. Nah, I\\'m short, horny, and lazy so I didn\\'t want to climb up there everytime I wanted to get off. \\n\\nWell, under my bed the boxspring has a hole in it, perfect for objects such as a dildo. The hiding spot is set up so that when you look under the bed, you can\\'t see the hiding spot, just the empty space underneath. \\n\\nI decide to hide my dildo, as well as a several other items of contraband (condoms and an anal plug), balanced on a piece of plywood in the boxspring. Perfect place for it, why would anyone be searching under there anyways.\\n\\n\\nAfter I get off work, I\\'m greeted with a text from my mom that says, \"We need to talk.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nOh fuck, she found my dildo didn\\'t she.\\n\\n\\nTurns out, while I was away at work, my mom was searching for a pair of her shoes (that I did not have) in my bedroom. I\\'m assuming the bed got bumped causing the dildo to fall off the piece of plywood onto the ground, but the point is she found my veiny purple dildo. \\n\\nFor context, my family\\'s religious and I don\\'t seem like the type that would have a dildo. \\n\\n\\nHere\\'s a couple highlights of the conversation:\\n\\n\\nHer - I found a purple dick under your bed.\\n\\n\\nMe - Oh really? Hahahahaha\\n\\n\\nHer - I haven\\'t had sex in [a long time] and even I\\'ve never bought one of those.\\n\\n\\nMe - Oh, well if you want I could buy one for you.\\n[I\\'m aware this wasn\\'t the best thing to say, but I seem to lose any filter I have when I\\'m nervous]\\n\\n\\nAt least she chuckled at that, maybe because of shock. But it made the situation slightly more bearable. \\n\\n\\nHer - Why do you have one anyways?\\n\\n\\nMe - Well it\\'s just my curiosity, hormones, and I felt bad for wasting so many cucumbers.\\n[Again, another stupid thing to say but I don\\'t think she heard. Or she ignored me]\\n\\n\\nThen she brought up the condoms, guess a couple fell down with the toy, and asked if I was sexually active. I assured her I\\'m not, and that I got them because they were cheap and so that I could use it on the dildo when I didn\\'t feel like washing it. Truth is, I got them because they were colorful (pink, yellow, and green) and I thought it would be funny to whip those bad boys out if I ever do have sex. But I felt like I had embarrassed myself enough already.\\n\\nShe was more disappointed in me than angry. I think we both shared feelings of shame and embarrassment, but she reacted differently than I thought she would. I have no idea how I\\'m going to look her in the eyes tomorrow.\\n\\n\\nAt least she didn\\'t find my butt plug. \\n\\n\\n\\nTL;DR - Bought my first sex toy a couple days ago. Found a good hiding spot for it, turns out it wasn\\'t good enough and my mom found it. Don\\'t know how I\\'m gonna look her in the eyes tomorrow knowing what she knows about me. Also relocated my toy to the upper shelf of the closet. Hid the other stuff in other places of my room. Don\\'t wanna keep all my eggs in one basket. \\n\\n\\nEDIT: I am 18 and female. I bought my dildo and butt plug at the same time, I refer to my dildo as my \"first\" sex toy because I used it first. Hope that clarifies some things :)\\n\\n\\n\\nUPDATE: It\\'s 9:30 AM and I still havent seen her. She isn\\'t even in the house \\n\\n\\nUPDATE #2: It\\'s noon and she\\'s still not home. Gonna give her a call.\\n\\n\\nUPDATE #3: Just called her and she didn\\'t answer. Sent her a text too. Haven\\'t seen her since last night. Getting kinda worried she might be avoiding me. \\n\\n\\nUPDATE #4: Just got a text back from her, I guess we\\'re gonna forget this all happened. Which is fine by me :) I\\'ll update if she mentions it when she gets home.\\n\\nhttp://imgur.com/a/IXAFwqf This happened monday morning. I shared the story with a friend of mine and they told me I had to post it here. So here goes.\\n\\nI\\'m into bondage. I\\'m kinky. I have a LOT of gear ranging from the mild (handcuffs, buttplugs, blindfolds) to extreme (armbinders, sleep sacks, hoods), and I also own quite a few latex catsuits. To accentuate my figure and bend the gender lines one of the suits I own features rather large breast forms. I tend to pair this with a latex underbust corset cinched tight, ballet boots, and all the gear I can get into on my own.\\xa0\\n\\nThis was how my Monday started. Shaved smooth, loads of baby powder on my skin and the inside of the latex suit and I was under way.\\xa0\\n\\nThe self-bondage release was a timed lock that would pop open once the timer ran out (one hour), which would allow me enough freedom to slide my hands out of the leather mitts I planned to lock them in.\\xa0\\n\\nI outfitted myself further before the final steps were taken. The zipper on the crotch of the suit was left open, so that I could lock myself into a chastity device. An inflatable, vibrating buttplug eased itself into me. I slid the zipper towards my crotch, helping seal the plug in. This was one of my favorites. With the help of a few black straps (locked on of course) a Hitachi wand would buzz away mercilessly on the device, keeping me aroused, on edge, and once I achieved orgasm would keep me enduring the stimulation. This was my favorite part. I looked forward to it all week when I planned my newest adventure.\\n\\nI applied a few leather straps to my ankles, calves, and thighs (also locked on!) before I moved to fully restraining myself. A metal chain was locked to the strap securing my ankles together and was left to secure me in my hogtie.\\n\\nA form fitting open-mouth style leather hood sealed me into darkness (locked on of course) and a ball-gag completed the look (locked on, to be safe I made sure the gag could be pushed out with force).\\n\\nA heavy, thick, black leather posture collar was added (with two locks) around my neck. The chain that I previously added to the piece dangled behind me, holding the mitts, and swayed around the small of my back.\\n\\nI turned onto my stomach, located the chain from my collar with the mitts attached, and the chain from my ankles and locked them together. This forced me into a hogtie.\\n\\nI threaded the timed locked through attachment points on the mitts and the chain. The *beep* confirmed the timer had started. I flipped the wand on for stimulation, and carefully slipped my hands into the mitts. I had practiced this before, and found that the angle my arms and hands were held in would allow me to get into my bondage, but the locked mitts would cinch more once I applied my weight to them. This was key: since I now had to wait for the lock to time out, pop open, and allow me the use of my hands.\\n\\nEvery lock I used (14 in total) had a key that sat a few feet away in a secondary lock box that was also set to open in an hour. I did this on the off chance that I wiggled free in some unforeseen way. I would still be left in all my gear, waiting to get back to the keys.\\xa0\\n\\nI wasn\\'t positive I would hear either the timed locked or the ring on the lockbox go off. I also set an alarm on my phone as an added alert.\\n\\nI loved the hogtie, loved feeling my breast forms in the suit, loved the buzzing off the wand as it kept me on edge for my entire ordeal.\\xa0\\n\\nMy phone went off. Shaking me out of my bondage induced haze. I could hear the hum of the fan and feel the breeze on my hooded and gagged face. I jingled my mitted hands to wiggle the lock free (like I practiced a dozen times). No such luck. I took a breather. Resting my head caused me to wallow in the drool caused from my ball-gag. I wiggled again, pulling on the mitts caused my ballet boots to bend towards my shiny, stuffed ass. Again, nothing was freeing itself. My mitts should have come loose by now, allowing slack to slide my hands free (like I practiced a dozen times!).\\xa0\\n\\nMaybe that wasn\\'t an alarm? Was someone calling me? When you spend an hour the way I spent my last hour, you hear things, you\\'re not thinking exactly straight.\\n\\nI wiggled some more. I knew I was in trouble when my alarm went off again, fifteen minutes later.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nI live in a moderately populated state capital. On a busy road, above a tattoo shop, which my landlord owns. I see her frequently. Tall, thin, blonde. Lots of tattoos, always cheerful with a wonderful smile. A single mother of two. She\\'s a badass.\\n\\nI knew she was in her shop seeing customers. That was a little bit of the thrill for me in doing what I was doing. It was also a layer of safety. I stewed in my self-inflicted hogtie of shame for a while. I never thought I would need to do what I was about to do.\\n\\nI managed to push the gag out of my mouth, and squirmed to my phone. Without use of fingers I had to ask google to call the shop. My phone wouldn\\'t bypass the alarm, instead my Google home lit up.\\n\\n\"Rivers Tattoo and Microblading, how may I help you?\" It was my landlord. Thank god. Was this the easy part? During this entire fiasco the wand is buzzing away on my crotch, rattling the padlock, teasing me both literally and figuratively *nice going, moron*\\n\\n\"Hey Lauren? It\\'s Morgan upstairs….\"\\n\\n\"Oh hey, what\\'s going on? Why are you calling the shop?\"\\n\\nI fumbled over my words, not knowing where or how to even remotely begin to describe how stupid I am and what exactly she was going to walk into.\\n\\n\"Wait, so you need me to come upstairs?\" She asked after I explained, clumsily, that I was in a rather compromising predicament.\\n\\n\"With the key to the front door. And I can\\'t apologize enough for what you\\'re about to see. This is absolutely humiliating, and I am so sorry for putting you in this position, but it was either call you, or 911…\"\\n\\nThe phone hung up. I listened intently for her footsteps traversing the staircase. Keys rattled. The door swung open and creaked. I scanned the room as if I would somehow be able to see beyond the hood.\\n\\n\"Holy shit, you weren\\'t...jesus...how the hell did you get yourself into this?!\"\\n\\nI didn\\'t even bother answering. I apologized over and over. The wand kept buzzing. Her view must have been quite the sight.\\xa0\\n\\n\"Stop saying you\\'re sorry. I\\'m just happy you\\'re not harmed. Thank god I was here today! Are you okay?\"\\n\\nShe asked what she needed to do. I asked her to shut the wand off, and apologized again. I had been leaking a lot of precum in the device and I knew there was a lot of fluid down there. I was a mess. The low hum of the plug grabbed her attention, she commented on not even wanting to know *what this was for.* I figured she meant the black hose and bulb.\\n\\nI explained that the lock failed to open. It usually pops free and open when the timer ends. Like it has twenty times before.\\xa0\\n\\n*Everytime I did a dry run*\\xa0\\n\\nBut it was still jammed. So we moved to the container with the keys in it. They all looked the same, the keys, but only one key opened one lock. I told her once she found the ones to my mitts, I could do the rest. I figured she would rifle through them. But instead tried every lock with the key she chose. It was agonizing, lying there, hooded and exposed. I asked if she just wanted to try each key in the mitts, but she didn\\'t seem to care to speed this process up. I wondered what the look on her face was.\\xa0\\n\\nAmusement? Disgust? Embarrassment? Indignation? I never was one to push my kinks onto people. And here I am. Giving her an eyeful.\\xa0\\n\\nFinally she popped the mitts free. I was sore. My shoulders burned, my calves ached from the ballet boots.\\n\\nShe made a joke about the rent being due and this not being an excuse for late payment. She laughed. I was relieved that she wasn\\'t totally mortified, angry, anything negative.\\n\\nI apologized once more, and she headed back down the stairs while I thumbed through the rest of the keys to undo my hood and suit. I desperately needed a shower and a reset.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nTL;DR Lock failed in my self bondage. Had to call my landlord to free me.\\n\\n\\nEdit: rip inbox!\\n\\nEdit 2: I used these images as inspiration for my colossal fuck up\\n\\n[Here](https://i.redd.it/brmxs8c5cly31.jpg)\\n\\nAnd\\n\\n[Here](https://gfycat.com/realisticcoarseislandcanary) This was a few years ago but still stands as one of my least-proud moments. I was spending a few months in Prague, Czech Republic (I’m American) and was house sitting for my friend. After almost a month in Prague, I started to pick up a few words here and there and was trying to bravely attempt to speak Czech.\\n\\nI took my Shih Tzu out for a morning walk and there was a gorgeous Czech woman who was also out walking her dog. She stopped to admire my pup and asked the usual questions “Holka nebo kluk “? ( A girl or a boy?) to which I proudly replied “Kluk!” to indicate that my dog was a boy. I was feeling great that I could understand and reply to a question in Czech! The next thing she said, and the only word I Picked up was “Kastrovani” (castrated) - she was asking if my dog was fixed - to which I gleefully replied “Ja, Kastrovani”.\\n\\nI took German all through school and of course “Ja” in German means YES. However, in Czech “Ja” means “I” and I confused the two words in a moment of panic and therefore told the first Czech woman that I attempted to talk with that, Yes I was castrated 🙄. She made a puzzled confused face and then said, in perfect English “Oh, you’re American!”\\n\\nSorry folks the stereotype is true - Americans are not great at language and I am truly sorry for my people.\\n\\n**TL;DR- I accidentally told a Czech girl that I was castrated instead of telling her my dog was fixed**\\n\\n**UPDATE EDITS WITH FAQ:**\\n\\n1. **NO.  We didn\\'t do any of the following: smash, bang, fuck, raw dog, marry.  I left and we never spoke again.  YES my then Czech wife was in the apartment and I was not about to cheat on her.** \\n2. **NO I was not actually castrated, sorry to disappoint everyone with the clickbait title!**\\n3. **YES - It is in fact a very common question to ask a stranger if their dog has been fixed, especially when your dog is a male who ass-sniffs every female dog in site.** \\n4. **YES - I do know the Czech word for YES is \"ANO\" or \"JO\"**\\n5. **Thank you all - I had no idea this would blow up like it did.  It is a completely true story and I am happy to hear that other people have had similar language fail experiences.**\\n6. **YES - Czech Republic is an amazing and beautiful country and the language is fascinating and the people are great. The women are beautiful and they are not shy nor easily embarrassed. I probably would have had a real connection with this woman had I been single, we could have laughed about it and I would have asked her out for a drink.**  So this FU happened about 45 mins ago and I’m currently laying in the bath recovering.\\n\\nI ordered a food delivery from the local supermarket to be delivered this morning. I work from home so it’s super convenient. I had had a super shitty day yesterday so was having a slow morning- it got to 10am and I was still in my dressing gown (with no belt and nothing underneath), hair unwashed and awful, and mascara down my face.\\n\\nI get a knock at the door and think it’s the postman, only to see that it’s my food delivery. I’m annoyed at myself as I completely forgot- usually I’d be ready and dressed and have shut the cats in another room (they’re currently indoor but try to escape).This is where the first thing goes wrong. I go to take the first tray from the driver - we get the food delivered in big basket trays, you take them into your house and unload then go give the trays back. As I take it, my dressing gown swings open and I’m fully naked underneath. I panic and turn around quickly apologising, but from the red glow emanating from his face, he clearly saw everything. I run to the kitchen and dump out the shopping, grab a scarf from my coat rack and tie that around my waist, making me look ridiculous but at least covered!\\n\\nHe is now bringing the other 2 trays to the door, I pick up the second. As I’m walking to the kitchen, one of my cats makes a run for the open front door. She’s recently rescued and not allowed out quite yet, so I panic and try and block her way with my foot. At this point, my lower back completely gives way, and I collapse to the floor in pain, covering myself, my cat and everything in the groceries (including a jar of cornichons that smashes). \\n\\nI’m now on the floor and can’t move, covered in pickle juice, already looking a state and I have a very angry cat next to me. I’m so stuck I have to call to the delivery guy, who has to come into my house and help me up- at which point I’m almost in tears from the pain. My other cat has now appeared and it’s trying to lick up the pickle juice so he’s also trying to move her away at the same time.\\n\\nHe helps me into the living room and brings the next tray of food in for me and starts to empty it on the sofa as I’m half laying half sitting on the floor next to it. I then realise how awful my living room looks- as I said I had an awful day the night before and had consoled myself badly by finishing a bottle of wine and then moving onto some gin. Both of which bottles are still on the living room table (with the gin lid off) as I hadn’t yet cleaned up. \\n\\nYou’d think that’d be it, and I’ve already disgraced myself enough looking like an unemployed alcoholic with no personal hygiene and half in tears, but oh no, my newer cat decides it’s time to come hurtling back down the stairs and straight out the front door which the delivery driver let swing open again when he rushed in to pick me up. \\n\\nSo now I’m unable to move and now actively sobbing as I’m in a lot of pain and I’m panicking she’ll run off. Between sobs I ask if he could possibly try and catch her as I can’t move and she’s old and scared. Luckily he is a hero and manages to wrestle her back in, which is no easy feat as she’s over a stone and very bitey and hissing. He practically yeets her inside and runs back to the safety of his little van without a look back.\\n\\nIt took me 20 mins to get up and hobble upstairs to get in the bath and then another 20 mins to lower myself in. And to cap it off, I’m now in the bath and realised I haven’t put any shopping away. Including ice cream. \\n\\nTL;DR: Forgot I had food being delivered, unintentionally flashed the driver, then asked him to pick me up after my back went, then accidentally made myself look like an unemployed alcoholic, then had to ask him to rescue a very angry cat. Also my ice cream has probably melted. Yup. I was hoping I\\'d never have material good enough to post on this sub, yet here I am. \\n\\nBasically, it all started out from my horny man-brain induced curiosity, as I\\'ve never really delved into the NSFW subreddits. I decided to do some research, and eventually ended up on a sub called /r/jigglefuck, as I am a connossuir of bouncing titties.  \\n\\nI had my wank, then went about my business. About an hour later, I put my phone into my pocket without turning it off. \\nLet it be noted that Reddit was not still open on my phone. \\nAll of a sudden, I hear an audible *gasp* from my SO. \\n\"Babe... What did you just send to my family.\" \\nI saw the look in her eyes and immediately knew what had happened. I opened my phone, and sure enough my leg decided it would be okay to open Reddit, press the share button, and send the link to /r/jigglefuck to my girlfriend\\'s family group chat. \\n\\nI should mention, this isn\\'t just any family. This is a huge Italian family with multiple branches and they were all in this chat. A solid 50+ people, half of them boomers. \\n\\nI panicked, threw my phone, realized that wasn\\'t going to do anything, grabbed it and left the group chat in a panic. \\nThen, I realized that looked even worse. I grabbed my girlfriend\\'s phone, and sent a message along the lines of \"don\\'t open that link, op got hacked.\" \\n\\nDead silence. \\n\\nNobody said anything. As far as I know the link to /r/jigglefuck and my half ass attempt at covering it up is the last message that was sent in the chat. \\n\\nI have to stare these people in the eyes. \\n\\nMy girlfriend thinks that I have a porn addiction. \\n\\nI fucked up. \\n\\nThis is likely my last post as I\\'ll either be laying in the grave I dug myself or somewhere in the mountains of Switzerland. Fuck.\\n\\ntl;dr I pocket texted porn to my girlfriend\\'s family group chat of 50+ Italians. rip.\\n\\nEDIT: forgot to mention this happened a couple nights ago. And typos/grammar Today was my first day off work since Friday last week and I decided to run some errands. While I was out I ducked into a grocery store to buy a drink and noticed that the store’s EFTPOS was down. The cashier told me that they could still process the sale, I just had to sign for it and the money would be taken out once it came back online. \\n\\nOn my drive home I realised that I had forgotten to pick up stuff for dinner so I swung into the grocery store closest to my place, which happened to be the same brand as the one earlier. I got my stuff with no problem and went to line up at the conveyer belt and this was where my fuckup began. \\n\\nI’m a person with anxiety so I always prepare something to say when I’m inevitably asked how my day is going. I knew that I was going to respond with “good, it’s been pretty busy although I had a sleep in this morning since I was at work so late last night”. I got up to the cashier and said hello, she looked at me in surprise and went “oh, are you not working today?” and I just panicked. This wasn’t what I had prepared for. So my stupid brain decided to go with what I had already prepared and I said “nah I was working late last night so I’m not in today.”\\n\\nThe second it came out of my mouth I wanted to hit myself. Why didn’t I just say that I didn’t work there? Sure I could correct her now, but I’m already in too deep. \\n\\nSo we start talking about work. She complains about having a three hour shift and how it only works out as two and a half hours pay. For some reason I say that I’m lucky that I’m not working since it looks like it’s a busy day. She asks me if I’ve heard anything about Shaun leaving. I said that I heard he is. She was upset about that, he’s a nice guy. I agreed, he’s one of the good ones. I have no fucking clue who Shaun is. \\n\\nI manage to lie my way through the conversation, mentally berating myself but also congratulating myself on my tremendous acting skills. We get to the point where I’m about to pay and what do you know, the EFTPOS is down.  Part of my coping for anxiety is trying to make others as comfortable and happy as possible so instead of having her freak out over the system going down, I simply explain to her how to process the sale. Information I only know because I was at the other store two hours ago! \\n\\nShe looks at me and goes, “well at least someone who works here knows what they’re doing.” I laugh nervously. Yeah...right. \\n\\nThen she asks me for my staff card to scan for “my” staff discount. And of course I don’t have a goddamned card. Who do you think I am, an employee? Luckily since I had only shoved my credit card into my phone case instead of bringing my whole purse I managed to come up with a lie about how I didn’t have my full purse so I don’t have my card. That’s alright though, she can put it through on hers and I can sign it. \\n\\nI signed a name that definitely wasn’t mine. Is that illegal? Probably not. I then picked up my bags and ran. Didn’t even say bye. I needed out of there. \\n\\nAs I hurried away, I heard the guy on the register behind her turn around and go, “did you know her?”\\n\\nI don’t think I can ever go back there. Either I’d have to attempt to keep up the pretence or go back and own up to it and face the shame. So I think I’ll take option three and avoid my neighbourhood grocery store like the plague. \\n\\nTL;DR: Cashier at my local grocery store mistook me for a coworker. Instead of correcting her my anxiety ridden brain decided to play along. I got in deep enough that I was teaching her to process sales. After she gave me her staff discount I fled the store and now don’t ever want to show my face again.\\n\\nEdit: wow thanks for the silver! And because a few people have asked, yes I am in therapy. I have been on and off for almost ten years. I suffered from abuse for the majority of my life and while 99% of the time I’m perfectly functioning I do still have a compulsive need for people to like me because that it something I deem safe. Hence my inability to rock the boat by telling her that she thinks I’m someone I’m not. That could end in an unsafe situation and in those moments it’s not a risk I’m willing to take.\\n\\nEdit two: and some golds! Damn if I knew you guys enjoyed anxiety fueled fuckups then I’d have been sharing my dumb stories ages ago. Two weeks ago, I was accepted into a research study for healthy individuals to monitor the affects of a drug on their system and how long it lasts in the body.  I prepared for weeks, making sure I followed all the rules in advance.  It required 6 stays of 4 days onsite, and the restrictions were pretty lengthy - but it paid $6,300.\\nIn the restrictions, it stated to avoid excessive amounts of a specific chemical found in chocolate and coffee, within 48 hours of the first dose.\\n\\nMy first dose was on a Tuesday, and Sunday morning, on my flight home from a work conference, I had a single piece of dove chocolate at 10am Central Time.  Not excessive, right?  Wrong.\\nApparently they meant - No chocolate or coffee.\\n\\nAs I was sitting in the research center, getting ready to settle in for a few days, they asked the question about chocolate.  I told them the truth.  The assistant left to check with the director, and came back saying it was 47hrs from the time of my dose, so I was disqualified.  I gaped at him, and said \"wait! That was 10am CT, we are in Mountain Time, so it\\'s actually 48 hours!\"  He left to tell his director, and they both came back.  I was still disqualified.  Apparently, the last dose was possible at 8:55am.  I missed the cutoff by 5 minutes.  They wouldn\\'t budge, and I was sent packing.\\n\\n$6,300.... gone. Like that.  It still hurts.  Enough so, that it has taken me two weeks to write this.\\nAt least it was Dove, and tasted good.  And the funny part? The inside of the wrapper said \"You can do anything, but you can\\'t do everything.\" - Shirley K Maryland\\n\\nEdit: As I keep getting asked: This one was http://prastudies.com But search your area for paid studies, as they only have 4 locations\\n\\nEdit 2 for clarification answers: \\n\\nSorry, I walked away for a couple of hours and this blew up. I\\'m trying to answer what I can.  But the common themes:\\n\\n1) I\\'m a woman. (No that has no bearing on my post, but it was mentioned often in the comments, so I\\'m clearing it up)\\n\\n2) I know, I could have lied... but I kind of have a thing about lying.  Especially working in the medical industry as long as I did.  Lying in medicine is a major no-no.  There is a lot more than money at stake.\\nAlso, I actually thought I was in the clear.  I figured the test drug was going to be a night time pill, not a first thing in the morning pill. Not to mention, excessive to me isn\\'t a small bite of chocolate.\\n\\n3) I don\\'t work for Dove, or the study group. I\\'m a project manager. This is truly just me screwing up.  And yes - I own my mistake. \\n\\n4) I won\\'t be taking legal action because I truly don\\'t believe there is any to be had.  I ate the chocolate. That\\'s on me.  Just because I don\\'t agree with the language to which I was told to avoid it, doesn\\'t mean I didn\\'t still make the mistake.  Also - $6,300..although a lot of quick cash, is not a lot for litigation. No point.  I\\'d lose more than I\\'d gain. This way I\\'m also able to continue applying for other studies going forward.  They have new ones every week.\\n\\n5) They were very clear about how compensation works, and I didn\\'t reach the point of compensation.  \\n\\n6) This is not about eating Dove soap. Which would have been really funny I think.  A few people mentioned this is called Galaxy chocolate across the pond.\\n\\nTL;DR - I ate a piece of Dove chocolate 5 minutes too late, and it cost me $6,300 because it was a restricted food in a research study I had joined.\\n So I was home alone one day with me and my wife\\'s pet turtle and I was probably drunk or super bored and lonely because I was looking at the turtle in its tank and thought it would be a good idea to bring it to the balcony to see the view. We live on the 5th floor of an apartment building and while I was carrying my little friend in my hand I rested in on the railing with my hand still securely on it. But then out of nowhere, just as i was starting to relax, it started to flail around and I lost my grip of it and I watched as it fell down 5 floors and landed shell first on my 1st floor Neighbour\\'s head. The turtle was surprisingly unscathed but my neighbour had a pretty bad concussion and I ended up paying for his medical bills.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTL;DR Decided to show my turtle the view from my 5th floor balcony but dropped him on my neighbour\\'s head.\\n\\nEDIT: Since some are asking, yes the neighbour is ok. It was pretty bad at the time but fortunately didn\\'t have any lasting effects. Also turtle shells are insane.\\n\\nEDIT 2: Well fuck me this exploded. To address some people rightfully telling me that I\\'m an irresponsible pet owner, well you\\'d be right. This sub has the words \"Fucked up\" in it and that\\'s exactly what I did.\\n\\nEDIT 3: A lot of you guys are concerned for the neighbour in the long run and trust me I am just as, if not more, concerned because it was my fault. Me and him are actually cool and have a laugh about it from time to time but I do feel super bad about it and unsurprisingly, I no longer intend on showing my turtle how many cars are refilling gas across the street anymore. This is probably gonna be the final edit so thank you to everyone who was concerned for my neighbour or my turtle. Or both. As to all the people calling me a fucking idiot, I don\\'t blame you. I\\'ve brought this upon myself. NSFL? If you\\'re eating something then I\\'d suggest not reading this.\\n\\nYou ever seen those stories on the reddit museum of filth? Like, the crusty cum shoebox or the Rainbow Dash figure that was boiled in a jar of cum, and realised \\'Why is there no female version of this?\\'. Well, sit down because I\\'m about to tell you the story of how I inadvertently fucked myself... with a stick full of maggots.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nSo, I have this pool diving stick that I use to fuck myself. I live with my parents so I can\\'t really get an actual toy. Now, this pool toy has two holes on the \\'shaft\\' to allow water to fill in and out of it so it can sink to the bottom of the pool. This also allows it to fill with my girl juices when I use it. The problem? The fluid gets stuck in there since it\\'s relatively more viscous than water. So I\\'ve had this thing for about 6 months. I try my best to clean it out by running it under the tap and rinsing it out every couple of weeks but I can never really get the solidly dry stuff. This, combined with the fact that I always just sort of shoved it down the side of my bed, or stuffed it in my bedside cabinet once I was done with it made for a pretty nasty smell. It wasn\\'t usually that obvious unless you got close, but earlier today, once I had finished fucking myself, I put it in my drawer and sat up in my bed. I noticed that not only did it smelled significantly worse than usual, maybe due to the summer heat, but also \\'down there\\' also felt like it was on fire. Not enough to be painful, but enough for me to notice it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nHere\\'s where the interesting part starts. I decide. \\'Hey, It\\'s currently 4AM, everyone is asleep, I can go and cut this thing open.\\' Sort of like a fucked up episode of \\'What\\'s Inside\\'. So I reach into my drawer, grab my phone and make my way downstairs into the kitchen where I clear out the sink and put this thing down in it. I use a pocket knife to start cutting it open, starting from one of the holes on the side. I\\'m scared to open it, but I understand that I must, and I put down the pocket knife and gently tease apart the two sides of the incision I made. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI. Am. **HORRIFIED.** Dozens of little maggots squirming around inside. I started gagging, until the realisation set in. \\'I just stuck this thing inside of me. I may have maggots crawling around inside of my vagina right now.\\' The fact that they were maggots... doesn\\'t that mean they had been there for a while? How long does it take fly eggs to hatch? In my state of panic, I snapped a quick photo (already knew that I was going to post that thing on 4chan), and rinsed out the entire thing with water, before cutting it into another 3 pieces and thoroughly rinsing them out with bleach and double wrapping them in a plastic bag and throwing it in the bin. I return to my room, disgusted, and make a [4chan post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/4chan/comments/c6uwi5/femanon_embraces_her_inner_neckbeard/) I didn\\'t know what to do after that, except wait for my family to wake up so I could have a shower without worrying about disturbing them. I have my shower and take a nap. That\\'s the end. TL;DR I took too many edibles, tripped out.\\n\\nObligatory it was yesterday yadda yadda yadda.\\n\\nSo to start off I would like to say that I smoke weed about 3-4 times a week. I smoke maybe a gram, or more with friends. I have never smoked so much that I lost control of myself, or couldn\\'t function. I have never thrown up from smoking too much, so I would like to consider myself a heavy weight. However, I had never tried edibles.\\n\\nI decided to make some at home, because I like cooking, and I decided to make an omelet with canabutter. The recipe said around 4 grams of high THC concentrated grams of weed. I grow my own, and pride myself on a cannabis plant with high THC content, but 4 grams for 1 WHOLE CUP of butter and half a cup of water?!?!? That seemed absurd, and I was eating w a friend, so I used 4 grams for 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of water, thinking I will just be careful with dosing. I invited A, as in ONE, friend over, (let\\'s call him Jason)and we made the omelet. I added about 2 tablespoons of the cannabutter, blended and cooked for a long amount of time I might add, or approximately half into the actual egg mixture (4 eggs and a couple table spoons of sour cream w some spices). I then added a very little bit to melt on the pan, but I thought it couldn\\'t hurt so I added more. Also, the whole time I was thinking my friend would help me finish it.\\n\\nI made the omelet, we dug in, and then we quickly drove to a nearby chili\\'s because we knew they were strong, and we didn\\'t want to drive under the influence. I got there, and barely ordered our water when everything hit me all at once. I felt like the air became corn syrup. The waitress was standing right next to me, and then I blinked, and I swear on my mother she just teleported to the other side of the table. My friend was obviously also high as a kite. It\\'s hard to explain how high I was, and then I played some games on the little Ipad they had. I sat there, and I kept thinking about how I had to say something or else it would be awkward. Then I started freaking out when one of my other friends got here(I\\'ll go with Clarissa), I had invited her prior but she does not partake in weed. I forgot my Jason was there, because in my mind I only had one friend sitting down w me at Chili\\'s. Then I turned an saw my Jason, and he was just smiling. He said he felt like there were hooks in his cheeks holding his smile up, but it felt good. I asked Clarissa whether or not she felt as if the service was taking forever, but she told me she just sat down. I felt like she was gaslighting me, because I could have sworn we were there for like a  couple hours. I said I needed to take a piss, so I started walking to the bathrooms. That is when I walked into the girl\\'s restroom. Luckily nobody was there, but I was so confused until I realized it was the women\\'s restroom due to the lack of urinals. After washing my hands in what felt like water so hot it was freezing cold I went back to my table. As I sat down, both of my friends were gone. I thought, in my state, they had somehow gotten lost at the table, I honestly don\\'t know how but I distinctly remember thinking that I had to find them or else they would be lost forever. I found my way back to our car, and they were in there. I started knocking and telling them to let me in, but for some reason they wouldn\\'t. Sick of their shit, I started slamming, saying,\" If you fuckers don\\'t let me in I will break this glass.\" Then, to my intense horror I realized this was in fact not our car, but somebody else\\'s. I went back inside and sat down, my friends were there. They said they just watched me walk up to the table, say,\" I gotta find them.\" and then walk outside. I can confidently say I was high even the next morning, which freaked me out even more. Safe to say I will follow recipes to the T from now on.\\n\\nEdit: Now I\\'m kinda mad I used my throwaway account for this.\\n\\nEdit: I get it, I\\'m not a heavyweight, hence my overestimation by a long shot. This has turned into a dick length contest- \"You think you\\'re a heavyweight? I smoke 2 oz a week,\" or, \" You think you\\'re a heavy weight? You are fucking stupid you small child, little dick, cunt. I smoke an 1/8 a day, and smoke wax constantly you fucking pussy. I also fucked your girlfriend.\" Like jesus calm down.\\n\\nEdit: Many people doubt this story due to me not describing how I made the cannabutter, all I can say is that this is the story of how I fucked up, not how I made cannabutter. If you must know, yes I decarbed it (55 minutes at 220, in between foil on a baking pan) , then blended, and cooked it in a pan till it browned, dark brown close to a burnt smell, but not. I then blended it again. I didn\\'t have cheescloth to strain, so I didn\\'t extract the weed, just blended it in.  the strain was sour diesal. HMU w anymore questions to \"debunk\" me, I\\'d be happy to answer. Mandatory not today but 20 years ago. \\n\\nI am 16 and horny. We didnt yet have the internet and this was still the days of searching nearby woods for scattered magazines held together by many long rains. It was also the days of waiting for your mom to go to the grocery store and using your free time to try to find literally anything new in the house to have sex with. This was one of those days. \\n\\nMy mom left for the grocery store and I had an idea: duct tape a toilet paper roll filled with wet toilet paper to my penis. Make sure it\\'s really tight. Then, create a rope from duct tape and wrap it around the blade of the ceiling fan. Sit on one side of the ceiling fan and as the blades spin, it will pull and release the tube. Brilliant. \\n\\nAll starts well as I sit on a desk chair below the fan. A bit slow, but working so I turn it up. I start to notice that since there is no swivel, the duct tape is twisting and shortening. Its pulling violently on my pubes and skin. I cant get the fucking thing off. Fuck. I stand up to buy myself time. Shut off the fan: pull the string and wait. Oh fuck - still going. I\\'m on my tippy toes and my pubes are ripping. I pull the string and the fan begins to slow, but it\\'s still twisting. I slam my hand into the fan to stop it. The fan breaks out of the ceiling, but I\\'m free.\\n\\nAs I unpackage my pleasure tube, I find I\\'d ripped a fist full of pubes out. My foreskin was twisted like an Indian sunburn, checkered with blood and tears and the head of my penis is a ghostly grey.\\n\\nIt took 24 hours for the penis head to turn from mayonnaise to plum. My penis basically moulted over the next 3 weeks growing a new layer of penis over the old penis. I still have a long white scar down the shaft that has no feeling. \\n\\nGood times. \\n\\nTl;dr: duct taped my penis to a ceiling fan and ripped my pubes and foreskin apart.\\n\\nEdit: changed some words.\\n\\nEdit: I want to be clear how this was supposed to work. I am sitting off center of the fan on a chair with my penis taped to the edge of one fan blade. The tape is slack. As the blade moves away, the take becomes taught and rips my dick right off.  This just happened a few days ago. I\\'ve told my wife that I wished she would initiate sex more often, and last Thursday she decided to oblige. I was sitting on the couch watching TV when she came out of the bedroom looking sexy the way she does. She grabbed my hands and pulled me up and started kissing me, taking a few steps back towards the doorway to go to the bedroom. We stopped a little and started undressing each other, and when it was my turn to get her pants off I dropped down real quick to get them off asap.\\n\\nThe next thing I felt wasn\\'t joy in getting my wife naked, but searing pain! It turns out that I was too close to the corner of an endtable. I immediately stood up and clenched my cheeks while my wife, God bless her soul, was laughing hysterically trying to squeeze out the words, \"You took off part of your butt!\"  \\n\\nI ended up leaving a nice sized chunk of skin on the corner of the table. Fortunately it missed my poop chute, but I have a nice inch or so long gouge near my butt bone. That hurts, in addition to the bruising of the buttocks from hitting the table so hard. My wife continued to be double\\\\-over laughing while I was trying to stick Kleenex in my crack to stop the bleeding. 4 days later and showers still suck, and I need to be careful when I\\'m sitting down.\\n\\nTl;Dr Asked my wife to initiate sex, ended up taking off part of my butt on a table This happened yesterday. I got sushi with this girl after finally getting the courage to ask her out. (To those out there going through the struggle of feeling like you can’t talk to someone you like, just do it. It’s nowhere near as big a deal as you’re thinking. Don’t be too proud to ask your friends for advice either.) \\n\\nAnyway, this is the first time in years that I’ve had sushi. Everything’s going well as we’re just talking about school until I’m so focused on what she’s saying that I pick up the tasty-looking green paste with my chopsticks without any thought to what it is. \\n\\nAfter I throw it in my mouth and start chewing, she pauses and asks, “Did you just eat that whole thing of wasabi?” \\n\\nI stop chewing as the spiciness kicks in, and I realize that I’m dumb as fuck. I figured it would’ve been gross if I just spit it out into a napkin right in-front of her so I keep chewing slowly instead. That doesn’t help, so I grab the salmon with my sticks and start eating it along with the wasabi so that the taste isn’t so bad. This doesn’t help at all either and she can see me struggling to maintain.\\n\\n“Drink your tea.” She suggests.\\n\\n“Ah yes! Liquids! They exist!” I think to myself. \\n\\nAfter this only somewhat helps, I just smile, point towards the restroom, and nod my head in hopes that I at least look cute while dying on the inside. \\n\\nThe door’s fucking locked. \\n\\nAfter this I just swallow everything left, walk back to the table, and live with the flames inside my nose. The rest of the lunch was enjoyable though. Will probably jokingly ask her if she wants to go for some wasabi next time.\\n\\nTL;DR: Wasabi. Never again.\\n\\nEdit: I saw Cars 2 once around the time it came out but hardly remembered any of it. I just watched the Mater scene on YouTube though and honestly I could still see myself making the same mistake had my memory of the movie been better. \\n\\nI also wanted to say many of the comments have been pretty informing as well as heartwarming. Also, those of you who’ve tricked your family and friends into eating wasabi are straight up evil haha. I live in The Netherlands and where I live you have to draw lots for the more popular schools in the city. I enrolled my daughter in nursery school at a Montessori school. It’s a very popular school so I wasn’t sure if she would be able to go to kindergarten and school there. Normally I would have to enroll her when she turned 3 but because of COVID I had to wait 6 more months before being able to enroll her. Dreadful suspense. \\nFinally the day is here and I hear she’s in. I’m very happy and the first thing I tell her when I go pick her up from nursery school is: “Good news! You will be able to stay here when you turn 4!!” She doesn’t react very enthusiastic but it’s lunchtime so I think she’s just hungry and a bit cranky and don’t pay much attention. Normally she’s singing all the way home while sitting on the back of my bicycle but today she’s very quiet and not really answering my questions. When we get home I say again: “It’s great that you will be able to stay in school when you turn 4, isn’t it?” She started crying and said: “But I don’t want to, I want you to come pick me up!!!”\\nPoor thing thought I meant she would have to stay there forever and she must have been so confused and hurt by my enthusiasm.\\n\\nI’m just so glad she told me what was wrong! Imagine having this hanging over you for the next six months. I felt like the worst parent ever.\\n\\nTL;DR: I accidentally told my toddler she would have to stay at school forever.\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit: Thank you for the upvotes, awards and all your stories, you’ve had me laughing all evening. \\n\\nTo clarify a few points:\\n- I’m the mom\\n- I didn’t speak English, I used the Dutch word “blijven” which means stay.\\n- My daughter was ok once I explained I will come and pick her up every day\\n- English is not my first language so I didn’t know how to explain the proces properly but I found this on the website of the municipality: “If there are more applications than places, a lottery will be held. If your child does not get a place at your 1st-choice school, then the municipality will look whether there is a spot at your 2nd-choice school and then your 3rd-choice school, and so on.”\\n\\nHope that clears things up! When I was in seventh grade, I had this funny science teacher who loved to show off her collection of pets that ranged from a couple of bunnies to little hamsters in her classroom (she wasn\\'t allowed and had to let go most of her pets a few years later). One of the pets was a leopard gecko. At that time, I was very into reptiles so I was very interested in the gecko. Let\\'s call him Tom. \\n\\nAnyway, because she had so many animals, she would have her students volunteer to take them home on holidays and care for them. One of her rules is that you can only volunteer once so that everyone else can have a turn. I decided to wait until summer to volunteer for the gecko because that would be the longest holiday so I can maximize my time with the gecko. \\n\\nSummer came and I brought the gecko home with me. It didn\\'t move a lot or hunt the crickets that I put in it\\'s tank so I had to feed him by putting the cricket directly in front of his mouth with a pair of tweezers (that I never used for myself again). Tom got really lethargic about two weeks into the summer and the next day when I looked into his tank, he was dead. I freaked out. \\n\\nI cried and bawled to my mom about what happened and how my science teacher was going to hate me. Mom suddenly had an idea and we went to a pet store (not before we buried Tom in a box in our garden). We went to two different pet stores before we found a matured leopard gecko that was identical to Tom. Same size and patterns so we brought him and named him Tom. \\n\\nFast forward to end of summer and I had to return \"Tom.\" I was so ashamed of what I had done that I couldn\\'t look at my science teacher in the eye even when she thanked me for caring for \"Tom\" over the summer. \\n\\nFast forward again to first year university. I was scrolling down Facebook when I saw my old seventh grade science teacher posted something on her fb (we became friends after I graduated). She stated that her leopard gecko have lived a very long life of thirty-oneish years (and was probably the oldest one in the world) but now was over the rainbow bridge. She was so proud to have the gecko for that long. \\n\\nI haven\\'t had the heart to tell her that it wasn\\'t the same gecko. But she probably knows now because she passed away last year so she\\'s probably hanging out with two geckos. \\n\\nTL;DR The gecko died under my care so I switched the gecko for a live one so my science teacher wouldn\\'t hate me.\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks for the awards guys! And from what I can understand, it seems that this is a common problem among middle school science teachers lol. Stay safe everyone. This TIFU spans two days. One for the fuck up and one for the repercussions.\\n\\nYesterday my Husband and I went on our first “date” in two years. We dropped our kids off at his Mums and had 6 hours to ourselves! What to do? What to do?\\n\\n“Oh I know what’s a good idea!” Says Husband, “let’s drive for an hour to a teeny tiny town that’s holding its annual festival! It might be a bit of a wait to get in the gate with COVID restrictions but that should be fine!”\\n\\nSo we did. And because of said restrictions we were able to spend a reasonable time at each booth, chatting to the owners and receiving samples. We even bought a good amount of some of our favourite items!\\n\\nWhat a fun day! I even ate an entire sample packet that one of the vendors gave me on the way home it was so delicious.\\n\\nYou see, that’s where I fucked up. The festival was a Chilli festival. I had been nibbling away at individually wrapped samples of all sorts of chilli smothered goodies for hours. And then ate a whole packet of Reaper coated smoked sausage. I loved every second of chewing, sweating, fighting the forces of air (as any true chilli enthusiast knows happens when you’ve probably had too much) and then diving back in for more.\\n\\nSo today. Today I have to be back to Mum duties, keeping my kids entertained while my gut churns. We are out of wet-wipes so I only have dry TP to ease my suffering. Everything I ate yesterday had chilli in it. I revelled in the chance to get out of the house and do something fun. But now, now I suffer. And my oldest son will too. He still thinks I haven’t noticed the jerky has gone missing. That I haven’t noticed the fresh carton of milk is half empty. But I have. And we only have one toilet.\\n\\nTL:DR\\n\\nWent to a chilli festival and ate nothing but chilli all day. Now I suffer, but also get to enjoy watching my quick fingered son suffer after he stole my Reaper coated Jerky. I have to work from home during this mess. I work from the dining room while my kids (6 and 4) play. I can see/hear them most of the day. \\n\\nApparently while I was engrossed in work today, they took the wireless baby monitor and put in our bedroom because they “wanted to watch the cat sleeping.” By some grace of god, the cat decided to sleep under the bed and not on it. \\n\\nFast forward... I walk in the bedroom to blow dry my hair and my SO was getting ready to take a shower. One thing lead to another - we make sure the door is locked, make sure to keep the noise *relatively* down... \\n\\nAfter all, the kids were occupied at the dining room table, but as it turns out, they were occupied at the table with the receiver from the baby monitor.\\n\\nAs he jumped in the shower, I heard the door handle to bedroom jiggle. I said I was getting changed. My six year old said, “We can hear you. Why are you saying ‘uhh uh uhhhh uh [SO’s name]’? We could hear it A LOT.” \\n\\n“Ummm we were doing yoga! It hurts when he stretches me really far and I sometimes a grunt.” \\n\\n6 year old: Can we do yoga with you? \\n\\nCommence me, sitting with my two kids, making moaning noises while I do downward dog to make it seem normal. They are going to be so screwed when they go to their first yoga class and they sound straight out of an amateur porn tape 🤦🏼\\u200d♀️\\n\\ntl;dr: My kids put the baby monitor in our bedroom. We had no idea. We had a quickie and they heard the entire thing. I had to retcon by doing yoga while moaning.\\n\\nClarification: it was a video monitor. It was placed under the bed so nothing was seen. My son has nocturnal seizures - hence why a video monitor is needed at that age.\\n\\nClarification 2: I used to be a sex educator. My children are 4 and 6. There is certainly such thing as sex positivity, but age appropriate. They know male and female anatomy - they do not need to know the intercourse for pleasure that comes with such anatomy at that age. The emotional capacity of most 4 or 6 year olds could not process the information being given in a productive way. Developmentally, it will be about two years before I talk my 6 year old about sexual mechanics unless he has a specific question before then. I’m banking on it not being burned in their memory since they’re so young and to them, it wasn’t life-altering. So yes, I lied, kind of. I definitely got into some yoga positions.\\n\\nEdit: TIL that a baby monitor is also a Komodo dragon. That would have been a MUCH different f up\\n\\nEdit 2: Since so many are asking how I personally approach sex/sexuality with young kids: \\n\\n*I always answer questions very factually. They’ve noticed girls don’t have penises so that’s where we started. “Boys have penises and testicles, girls have vulvas/vaginas”. They know girls have eggs and boys have sperm. We never discourage touching themselves. We just redirect to do it in private and to wash hands. \\n\\nBut 4 and 6 are very young to begin talking about sex for pleasure. Their brains are only capable of processing so much. If my 6 year old were to ask how the sperm met the egg, I may tell him. But I’d leave it at that and leave out the sex for fun details. It’s not anti-sex positivity - it’s giving information at a time that’s developmentally appropriate\\n\\nIt’s also a great time to start (although it should be started as early as possibly) to talk about consent. I breastfed my youngest for 18 months and he got in the habit of using my breasts for comfort. Every once in a while when I’m snuggling with him before bed, he’ll put his hand down my shirt. I take it out and say, “I don’t like when you do that. Please don’t touch my boobies (only anatomical nickname we use). They are for milk for babies and toddlers, and you’re a big boy now.” \\n\\nBut even non-sexual consent, like “your brother asked you not to hug him right now. Please respect that” will help reinforce sticking to boundaries and that it’s always a non-negotiable.* I am divorced and have my two girls every other weekend. One Saturday morning, my oldest girl comes in to my room and she\\'s on the speaker phone with her mom. I hear mom say wake him up and then I wake up and address my child.\\n\\n\"Daddy, I have my period\", she says. Me: Um ok. I get up. Get dressed and point at my 9 y/o and say you\\'re in charge. I\\'ll be right back. I go to the store and faced with a sea of pads, I pick up a box of pads and a chocolate bar. My neighborhood cashier asks me if I found everything ok. I say yes.\\n\\nI return home and give my daughter the bag. She asks what the chocolate is for and I confidently reply - to make you happier. I leave her to her business assuming mom has groomed her in some way for this moment.\\n\\nFor backup, I call up a gf and told her about what was happening and she asked specifically what I bought for her. Depends undergarments and chocolate. I bought her elderly diapers. \\n\\n\\n\\ntl;dr My daughter has first period and I buy her elderly undergarments. English is my first language and I\\'ve been using mobile for years so any mistakes I make are because I\\'m dumb. \\n\\nI\\'m giving my sons a bath tonight, they are both toddlers, one and two years of age. They\\'re wild in the bath, so it\\'s always a struggle to get them both clean at the same time. \\n\\nI was sitting on the floor by the tub, washing their hair. I had the shampoo bottle sitting on the closed toilet seat next to me for ease of access. \\n\\nI got their hair washed, stood up and brushed myself off. Then went to sit on the toilet seat... With the shampoo bottle still there. \\n\\nBefore I continue, this isn\\'t some normal smoooooth shampoo bottle. This shampoo bottle has a pump that sticks out and sharp edges on the pump head. \\n\\nSo I sat on the shampoo bottle, it tore through my leggings and scraped its way into my lady bits. I screamed like the dramatic bitch I am and jumped up and down while my sons laughed like this was some twisted game. \\n\\nThe bottle came out with blood on it, but before I could check out the damage, a poop landed on me. My youngest had started to relieve himself and my oldest was throwing shit bombs at me like my youngest some some sort of sick pez dispenser. I had to pause my dramatics to deal with... All of that. \\n\\nSo I pull them out and get them dressed, then tend to my injuries. I have a tear between my urethra and vagina as well as on my clitoral hood which will need stitches. \\n\\nNot as dramatic as some TIFU stories but I\\'m waiting for a doctor and had nothing better to do than tell my shame. Also, pretty sure no one believes the \"I sat on a shampoo bottle\" story I\\'ve been telling here. \\n\\nTL;DR not everything is a dildo if you\\'re brave enough.\\n\\nEDIT: ok ok so many of you have asked to see an example of the bottle. I can\\'t take a picture of the actual antagonist of the story. We threw it out since a pice of the nozzle broke off, but here\\'s the product. Also, the recovery from this is impressively painful. Don\\'t do this\\n\\n[The worst douche design ever](https://www.amazon.com/Johnsons-Baby-Tear-Free-Sulfate-Free-Hypoallergenic/dp/B07D2JMJPS)\\n\\nEdit 2: wow! Thank you everyone for the support! This quarantine has been rough for my mental health and some internet strangers brightened my day ten times over. \\n\\nFor anyone else that wants to give gold, I definitely appreciate it, however if you could save the money and donate it to [RAINN](https://donate.rainn.org/donate?_ga=2.170694112.1196118730.1587047954-190085196.1587047954) or another charity of your choice instead, that would be just swell. \\n\\nI love you all ❤️ Everything is in the TL;DR.\\n\\n\\nThis happened yesterday but I’m feeling the repercussions today. \\n\\nIt started with me getting dressed and just throwing on lace underwear vs cotton. I was just staying home all day so it wasn’t a big deal because after my kid leaves for school I walk around naked anyways. \\n\\nMy kid reminds me that I have volunteered for his field trip and here’s a list of kids that I would be watching. \\n\\nI forgot so... Shit! I don’t have a lunch for him or I so I threw jeans on to go run to get a lunch. I figured I could change when I got back no biggie. However... My husband text me asking for me to get some things from the store that had to be picked up immediately. \\n\\nI had no time to change and made it to the field trip 10 min late. Fine, it’s fine. I’ll be ok. It’s 75degrees, I’m in jeans, lace undies, vagina freshly shaved from the night before. I didn’t think much of it. \\n\\nThere’s a lot of walking on this field trip though. I’m keeping up with the 8-9 year olds and I feel my underwear pull up between the lips of my vagina. So half my vagina is rubbing the lace and jeans while I walk. \\n\\nI can’t fix it at any point and at this age I couldn’t just adjust and lie about tucking in my shirt etc. This is the age boobs and “lady parts” are a big deal. \\n\\n*i did adjust at one point but my lady meat just fell out right away. \\n\\nSo for three hours my vagina is rubbing against uncomfortable fabric. It’s hot so my natural discharge and sweat are making it worse. I can’t adjust because the bathrooms are too far away for me to leave the kids and NONE of the little terds had to go! \\n\\nI got home and half my vagina was rubbed raw. My husband said it looked swollen or like a big ingrown hair was forming. \\n\\nTl;dr- I shaved my vagina so had no hair buffer when my lady meat fell out of lace undies and chaffed during a three hour walk-a-thon field trip. My vagina lips are swollen and it hurts to be a functioning human. This just happened. Currently shitting my life out, more on that later.\\n\\nSome background. My wife and I have been seperated for a month. The marriage is definitely over, just waiting on the legal shit. Anyway, I put myself \"back on the market\" and joined Tinder. I\\'ve been single a total of 6 weeks since 20 years old (I\\'m 34), so this is very new to me.\\n\\nI matched with a great girl that is also seperated, and looking for the same thing. She asked me over and, of course, I said yes! I was very nervous but figured I would eventually calm down.\\n\\nNow, the chain of stupidity. I\\'ve been fasting for the last 48 hours and just got on anti-depressants a couple of weeks ago. Knowing all that, I decided to stop by the local gas station and get an energy drink and a package of dick pills. A buddy had told me they work, and I wanted to make a good first impression.\\n\\nWell, that stupid combination destroyed my body. I was sweating profusely, shaking like I had Parkinson\\'s, and felt like I was gonna throw up. I figured, just go with it and push through, don\\'t ruin this!\\n\\nI probably could\\'ve pushed through, except that my dick shut off. Completely. It was like my body had too many emergencies going on and couldn\\'t provide the blood to make anything happen. Bless her heart, she tried, but no luck. \\n\\nNeedless to say, I left apologetically, with my heart racing, fever sweats, shaking, and my stomach in knots. I was in DEFCON 1 on the whole 30 min drive back home worried I would shit my pants or have a heart attack. Luckily I made it just in time to let the evil brown massacre out of me. My heart rate is still at 102bpm. I hope I\\'ll be able to sleep tonight.\\n\\nTL;DR I took gas station dick pills before a hookup which destroyed my body and shut my dick off, leaving me embarrassed, and in a panic.\\n\\nEdit: I\\'m an idiot, Parkinson\\'s not Alzheimer\\'s.\\n\\nEdit: Still an idiot, DEFCON 1, not 5.\\n\\nEdit: Wow, didn\\'t think it would be this popular. Sincere thank you for the support and the laughs. I\\'m a secondary computer science teacher. I teach kids aged 10-18, so a huge range of physical, mental and intellectual maturity. One of my favorite groups is my 5th grade Intro to Game Design class. They\\'re always excited about basically anything we do, and they are young enough that they still care about earning the respect of their teacher. I have two kids in particular that stand out in the class - Chloe and Linna (not their real names). Chloe is one of the sweetest kids I\\'ve taught. She is always bright-eyed and bushy tailed, a talented artist who has a lot of compassion for the people around her. She\\'s also a massive space cadet who needs to be constantly brought back on track with whatever is happening around her. Linna is blisteringly intelligent and well accomplished for her age, with a sense of importance that goes along with being a semi-prodigy at age 10. She became a Karen in utero, comes from a mighty line of Karens and shall one day walk among them as their Queen.\\n\\nWe spent about a week working in a piece of software that had been problematic for us from the start. Lots of weird server hangups and failed updates, because we\\'re in an international school and we can\\'t always connect properly. After 5 class periods of watching them flounder, I decided that I would try something new. I started up with the new software (no connection required) and an introduction activity. About 5 minutes into the activity, Chloe\\'s attention slowly wandered back from wherever it had gone:\\n\\nChloe: Wait, this isn\\'t that other software? Why aren\\'t we going to do that any more?\\n\\nMe: Nope. That project went to live on a farm in Wisconsin. We\\'re doing something new, now.\\n\\nChloe: Before we moved, my dog went to live on a farm in Wisconsin!\\n\\nMe: Oh...um...\\n\\nIt took me a moment, but that was the only opening Linna needed.\\n\\nLinna: Parents say that when your dog dies. Your dog is dead, \\\\*Chloe.\\\\*\\n\\nAnd then came the tears.\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*UPDATE\\\\*\\\\* : I felt so bad that I emailed mom to give her a heads up that she might have a sad kid on her hands after school. Mom replied that the dog was a little terrier and not very well trained. It bolted from her car in a parking lot after she\\'d taken it for pre-travel vaccinations. It was hit by another car and died on the spot. Poor pupper. They\\'re going to tell her a slightly less graphic version of the story. \\n\\ntl;dr: I made a joke to my 5th graders about a failed project going to live on a farm in Wisconsin. It turned out that a student\\'s parents had said the same thing to her when her dog died, and another student was only too happy to spell it out for her. Not really a fuck up, more just an unexpected suprise. So on Friday I woke up at 7:30 a.m. with abdominal pain. My girlfriend of 7 years told me to stop moving around so much and went to work. I was rolling around for about 3 hours until I realized that my pain was getting more localized in my right lower quadrant area. Since I work in the medical field I knew right away it was going to be an expensive day. So I grabbed my phone charger and went to the hospital. Was immediately checked into the emergency room, got a CT scan and was told by the doctor that I needed my appendix out that day. So I was admitted into the hospital, my parents and girlfriend came. They were by my side as I went into the operating room. When I came out of surgery and was in pacu, both my girlfriend and my parents were there waiting for me. Working in the medical field I knew that people my age (30 years old) say some crazy things from anesthesia but I didn\\'t realize how crazy it was going to affect my life. When I started coming to, the drugs/anesthesia affected my judgment and i made a life-altering decision. I looked at my girlfriend, pointed to her instead, \"I WANT TO MARRY YOU!\" right in front of both of my parents. She was in shock, so she turned to my parents and asked him if I was being serious or if it was just the drugs talking. They reassured her that I was serious because I had \"mentioned\" marriage to them in the past. So she said, \"of course I will\" and my parents said,\" welcome to the family\", then they all hugged. So yesterday I purchased her an engagement ring and the wedding planning has begun. So I guess the moral of the story is, sometimes it takes having less guts to have guts to do something?\\n\\nTl;dr got appendix out, proposed on drugs, I\\'m engaged\\n\\nEdit: Holy shit, front page? Really? Haha. A little background story, i was joking around in the comments. She waited until I was 100 percent first to make sure I really wanted to do it. I have discussed with my parents multiple times that I wanted to marry her also. My parents aren\\'t grandbaby crazy, we don\\'t want kids. I love my girlfriend and coming out of surgery made me realize how fragile and short life really is. No more fooling around. Thanks for the gold and front page! This happened at around 3am this morning. I’ve been working long shifts and haven’t had a weekend for two weeks now, and it’s really wearing me out. Last night I had to stay up a bit late so that I could wake up in the afternoon ready for my shift. My wife had gone to bed early. So it was just me, some beers and Netflix. I was getting very tired and nearing time for bed so I decided it was time for a pre-bed wank. I guess I was too tired/drunk and somehow in the middle of the process I passed out.\\n\\nMy wife woke up in the middle of the night to find I am not in bed and came to look for me. She stumbles upon the following scene: me, drunkenly passed out, curled up around a box of tissues and naked from the waist down, a small pile of tissues removed from the box, neatly folded and ready for convenience and my underwear on the floor next to the sofa. Next thing I know, I’m waking up to my wife asking if I’ve been wanking. I categorically deny her accusation, despite being surrounded by substantial evidence, and stumble to bed with her, still naked from the waist down. \\n\\nThis afternoon I showered to the chorus of my wife’s hysterical laughter and I’ve earned the new nickname “Wanky No-Pants”.\\n\\n\\n\\nTL;DR I passed out mid wank because I was too tired and drunk, and my wife found me\\n\\nEdit: thanks for the gold guys! I’m glad my wanking misadventure has brought you all so much joy So this actually happened today. Well, tonight, I mean. I\\'ve just gotten out of scrubbing myself in the shower and am ready to talk about tonight\\'s efforts.\\n\\nSo I went out for dinner alone tonight. I figured that I could go catch a set of my friend\\'s band playing and have dinner and a few quiet drinks. Once out, I run into two female friends who were on the sauce. I had a few mojitos, they had a good dozen shots each. We\\'re having a good night, I decide to head further uptown with them as they\\'re keen for the dancing and my buddy DJs at the club they were wanting to go to.\\n\\nOnce we start walking though, things change. All of a sudden, one of the girls - let\\'s call her Amy - has all the alcohol hit her. She\\'s barely able to stand, I end up giving her a piggyback ride the three or so blocks to the cab rank. You\\'d think her friend she went out with - we\\'ll call her Mary - would see this and want to put her in a cab, right? Nope, she\\'s been getting more and more pissed that I\\'ve been paying attention just to Amy and wants Amy to just go to the clubs with her. Straight away. Not after she\\'s had a few minutes rest. Right now.\\n\\nLuckily, we\\'re at the cab rank at this point, Mary storms off to go clubbing by herself, leaving me with an Amy that can\\'t even stand up straight. I get her in the cab and get in after her, ignoring all the glares and catcalls I\\'m getting from everyone around that think I\\'m going to take her home and molest her (welcome to Australia, where if you\\'re an ugly guy with a drunk girl, everyone immediately assumes you\\'re about to take advantage of her).\\n\\nAs soon as the cab takes off, she falls asleep on my shoulder. \\'Excellent\\' I think, \\'this should be easy, I\\'ll get her to her house, then her boyfriend can look after her and I\\'ll head back out\\'. Within thirty seconds, she starts throwing up in her sleep. All over the cab, all over me, in my hair, in my mouth. The cabbie is justifiably furious. I hand him the cleaning fee of $150 he is demanding in order to keep driving, then when we finally get to her house he kicks us out, not before demanding another $50 for the fare (even though the meter said it was a $12.70 fare).\\n\\nAmy jumps out and flops face-down into the dirt before I can even get out of my side of the car. Then she starts puking again. As I\\'m desperately trying to get her onto her side and keep her airways clear, she starts yelling at me to get her shoes off because she can\\'t walk with them on.\\n\\nWhich is when her boyfriend (that I\\'ve never met) opens the door and comes downstairs to see me hunched over his paralytic girlfriend, trying to take her shoes off while she\\'s kicking and screaming to get them off so she can go inside.\\n\\nLuckily this guy takes a few seconds, realises what\\'s going on and understands I\\'m not trying to assault his girlfriend and gets me to help carry her inside and get her into the bathtub. At this point I\\'m still wearing his girlfriend\\'s vomit like the world\\'s shittiest brand of beard oil, but once she\\'s in the bathroom, I\\'m out on the street. Dude does not want me around, which I suppose is fair enough. I mean, if a strange man showed up on the doorstep with my drunk girlfriend I\\'d be pretty pissed about the situation too.\\n\\nBut either way, I\\'m now out on the street, covered in vomit and in a strange part of town that I don\\'t know. After wandering around lost for twenty minutes, I finally found a lift home and got a well-deserved shower. And now I\\'m finishing typing this story up for all you fine folks.\\n\\nTL;DR - helped a drunk friend, got treated like a date-rapist, had to pay cleaning fees after she vomited all over the cab and myself, got turfed out in the middle of the night in a strange part of town still covered in said vomit.\\n\\nEdit: Wow, I did not expect this to blow up like this. I\\'m at work at the moment, but I\\'ll read what everyone has said when I get home tonight. \\n\\nBut if I could ask everyone to do one small favour for me, it\\'s go and do something nice for someone today please. Betting nice feels good.  :)\\n\\n2nd edit: Thank you for the gold, kind strangers!\\n\\n3rd edit: Now that I\\'m home I can actually read through the thread and wow, there\\'s a lot here. For all those who have given kind words, thank you so much, it\\'s super appreciated. For everyone asking why I posted the story, it was really only because I\\'ve read so many stories on here that have made me laugh, shocked me or made me feel for the people writing them, I honestly just hoped that maybe one or two people might have gotten a little chuckle out of it before it got deleted by the mods/faded into reddit history. It certainly wasn\\'t to big up myself or try to shame anyone. It has been interesting to read all the different responses here though.\\n\\nAnd for the people who wanted to know how the vomit got in my mouth, that was when we were in the cab sitting next to each other, she put her hand over her mouth while vomiting and some of it splashed/squeezed out the side, right onto my face as I was apologizing to the taxi driver. Absolutely a fluke shot, I guess if Dude Perfect ever want to do vomit videos she could get a job with them, haha.\\n\\nFor the people asking about Lyft/Uber, for the most part in Australia they are only in the capital cities. I live in a regional town in Queensland of about 60,000 people, neither of those companies are expanding here any time soon unfortunately.\\n\\nI spoke to both the girls briefly today and they\\'re certainly feeling more than a little embarrassed (and hungover). Amy has offered to transfer what she can now and will pay me back the rest on Thursday when she\\'s paid. She\\'s a good egg. So this actually happened maybe ten minutes ago.\\n\\nBit of context. My neighbours are extreme curtain twitchers. Our back gardens are currently open to each other since a fence blew down and neither of us has the money to replace it just yet.\\n\\nI\\'m a big guy, about 6ft1 (186cm) and I\\'ve been heavy for some time but when the scales touched 25 stone (350 lbs, 160kg ) I figured it was time to do something. So I\\'ve been eating better and losing some weight. I haven\\'t lost much but it\\'s enough to make my clothes\\' waistbands irritatingly unable to stay put.\\n\\nToday I\\'m lounging in some loose comfortable pants (soft material made for lounging or sleeping - decorated with dangermouse for anyone who cares) which are quite old with little elastic left in the waist. The wife is out with the kids and I\\'m getting on with some work. I\\'ve already had a strange interaction with next door neighbour (check it out over on choosingbeggars if u like.)\\n\\nThis being Britain, the sun quickly disappears and I hear the rain begin. \"Oh no\" I think, \"the washing is out on the line and if it gets wet again I won\\'t hear the end of it.\" So I head out and go to bring in the washing, I reach up for the first piece and my slightly smaller than usual waist betrays me. My arms are in the air unclipping pegs and my pants slide down. Now the unfortunate side is that I am also blessed with an arse and hips unable to keep pants up (thanks mam). I can\\'t stop them without dropping washing on the now wet ground. \\n\\nYou guessed it, those soft comfy pants are now heading for my knees, taking my also loose boxer shorts with them. My package is now floating free and easy in the late summer breeze.\\n\\nI rapidly fold up the item of clothing and shove it in the bag, and go to yank my pants up, when I suddenly lock eyes with my neighbour. She\\'s there at her window, twitching aside her blinds, ogling my junk. Might have only been a fraction of a second but it felt like hours we looked at each other through that window for.\\n\\nNow this woman is in her sixties and lives next door with her son, both of whom I\\'m fairly sure have learning disabilities. We\\'ve had several strange interactions with them over the years, but I think her viewing my cold-shrivelled pecker dangling in her window is possibly the worst.\\n\\nI\\'m sure the wife will howl with laughter when I tell her. \\n\\nTLDR: lost weight recently causing my pants to fall down while collecting hung washing, exposing myself to a nosy neighbour.\\n\\nEdited to fix an autocorrect.\\n\\nUpdate: Well this seems to have entertained far more people than I was expecting. Thanks for the silvers. I find it amusing my first awards are for public indecency. Just happy I could brighten so many people\\'s day. I tried to reply to as many as I could but it\\'s bed time now.\\n\\nFor those who are wondering, the wife laughed just as I suspected she would. Many thanks for all the kind words for the weight loss, and the pointers to the belts (not that they go with lounge pants but work trousers or jeans are just as disobedient right now).\\n\\nFinally, I\\'m sorry I can\\'t tell you where to get dangermouse pants these days. I bought mine from Asda (UK version of Walmart) around 4 or 5 years ago and haven\\'t seen them anywhere since. I had decided to reorganize my room some time ago and only made it about halfway through. My mom thought she would be nice and help clear out the clutter. Amongst my crap was the sex bag. What\\'s a sex bag? I\\'m not sure if anyone else has been so clever, but I decided it would be easiest to have all the sex equipment my SO and I use in one central location, or one plastic grocery bag. You know, condoms, lube, wet wipes, etc.\\n\\nI came home yesterday to find my room empty and sex bag relocated. She said nothing but it was clear she had seen and moved it. We\\'re kind of even because she recently bought a vibrator on the family amazon prime account and accidentally used my credit cards. There is now an unspoken agreement between us to not mention it. My SO and best friend had a good laugh at my embarrassment. Just remember to hide your sex bags better.\\n\\nTL;DR my mom found my sex bag but I also know about her recent vibrator purchase so we\\'re even in the worst way. So, before I start I want to acknowledge that I am a terrible terrible person and an irresponsible pet parent. I\\'m pretty much posting here because I expect Reddit to tear me to pieces and I think I deserve it. Everyone I tell this story to IRL just laughs :(\\n\\nThis didn\\'t actually happen today, it happened on Friday. I was in my pool throwing balls for one of my dogs, while the other watched (he doesn\\'t like the pool, only smelly ponds will do for swimming). His name is Leo, and he is a one-year-old border collie. Bouncy and adorable and loving.\\n\\nHe lays down by the side of the pool and I swim over to pet him. He stays lying down. This is not normal for Leo. He is an EXCITABLE dog. Every moment is play time. If I twitch at 3am it\\'s OMG PLAY TIME NOW?! No Leo go back to sleep. So I start calling his name and acting excited. Stays lying down. Barely opens his eyes. I start to worry, so I get out and walk back to the house. He can barely walk. Stumbling and falling to the side. I start freaking out. I get him inside and he lies down on the floor and doesn\\'t move. He\\'s CONSCIOUS, he hasn\\'t collapsed, but all he\\'ll do is open his eyes and look at me he won\\'t get up willingly. So obviously at this point I\\'m freaking the fuck out. Could be heatstroke, it was a warm day. But there were no signs of it, he had plenty of water and shade, and he wasn\\'t vomiting at all. \\n\\nSo I take him to my vet. They agree he\\'s not right and want to admit him over night. But they don\\'t have staff there overnight and I\\'m worrying my brains out, so I take him to the emergency vet about 40 mins away where they have 24 hour staff. I get him settled there, and then they call me and tell me they really can\\'t work out what\\'s wrong, all his tests are normal. Not dehydrated, liver and kidney function are fine. Heart rate\\'s a bit slow but not terribly. But he won\\'t wake up and if he\\'s forced to walk he falls.\\n\\nSo they say they\\'re really worried about him, and they want me to take him to the specialists about an hour away. I inwardly cry, because my other dog has had a stay there before and it\\'s expensive. But a pet parent\\'s gotta do what a pet parents gotta do. So off we go.\\n\\nWe get to the specialist. It\\'s about midnight by this point. I\\'m exhausted and tearful with worry. They admit him and send me home. Over the next few days, he has every test known to man. All normal. He has about 10 different neurological exams. Normal. He seems to be slowly improving day by day. On Monday they say I might as well take him home, he seems to be improving and they\\'re waiting on some more tests results. Basically, there\\'s nothing they can do right now that I can\\'t do at home.\\n\\nOver and over again they\\'ve asked if he could have gotten access to any toxins. And over and over again I say no. Nothing. He\\'s been with me all day. I can\\'t think of ANYTHING he could have gotten into.\\n\\nThen on Monday it hit me. I had been cleaning out the outside freezer, and caught him with his head in the trash bag. I shooed him away and thought nothing of it. It was just old food with freezer burn. Nothing that could hurt him. Then I remember. I used to store edibles in that freezer. STRONG edibles. My first batch before I figured out doses. One chocolate would knock me on my ass for a day. My usual dose was 1/4 a chocolate.\\n\\nHe must have eaten one. The poor little fucker was high as a kite for three days.\\n\\nHappy to say it\\'s been five days now and he\\'s right as rain. Currently demanding I throw balls for him in spite of a three hour walk this morning.\\n\\nBut ... fuck. I feel fucking terrible. I poisoned my dog :( poor little dude.\\n\\nTL;DR dog ate edible, was high for three days, vet bill was very very expensive. Long post but I have to explain myself lmao\\n\\nObligatory happened ~3 years ago. So, when I was 13, it was the night that school had finished for the summer, I was having a nice relaxing evening alone watching anime when my sister had come into my room looking for a hairdryer (she had just graduated and was about to go on a night out)\\n\\nShe had just put on fake tan and then left the bottle of it on my bedside table while she dryed her hair, I have a pretty big mirror so she wanted to use that, no problem, I just put on my headphones and think nothing of it.\\n\\nAnyway, she goes out for the night and I\\'m sitting at home, at around 11PM the power goes off, I figure that it won\\'t go on until morning so I just decide to hit the hay, but since I have some trouble getting to sleep, I decide to have a wank before I go to bed.\\n\\nYou can probably see where the fuck up comes into play, with the lights being off, I don\\'t know what\\'s on my bedside table and I just figure that its probably lotion. I start rubbing it onto me and imagine nsfw stuff in my head (I don\\'t really watch porn) \\n\\nAfter about a minute I start to realise that this doesn\\'t feel like lube, it\\'s kind of sticky and it just feels off. So I grab my phone and turn on the flashlight to just see orangy-brown goop all over my hands and dick, I\\'m a really pasty guy so I knew I had to get it off ASAP. I go to the bathroom and start rubbing soap and water onto my hands to try get as much of it off, and after about 10 minutes, it\\'s grand. It was sort of hurting my dick to try and rub it off, so I figured I could just shower tomorrow and that it would be okay. Big Mistake.\\n\\nSo, yeah, I\\'m 16 now and it\\'s still really, really discoloured, hasn\\'t been much of a problem for me yet because the kind of person who accidentally rubs fake tan onto their dick is also the person who doesnt pull very often. I\\'ve tried a bunch of solutions, baby oil, lemon and lime juice, fake tan remover.\\n\\nIt\\'s been 3 years though and at this point I think I\\'m going to have to live with it. It looks just wrong and shiny when flaccid but on the pluside it doesn\\'t look horrible erect. To the one person who inevitably messages me, no, you cannot have a picture. I\\'m still actually looking to fix this so if you have any advice it would be welcomed.\\n\\nTLDR: confused fake tan for lotion during a wank and now very white me has a dark brown dick\\n\\nEdit: fine, for gods sake lmao, I\\'ll ask my doctor whenever I\\'m in with him next\\n\\nEdit 2.0: A lot of people don\\'t think I\\'m 16, here you go: https://imgur.com/gallery/wvZJY1N Background - My lady love (LL) and I live in a house built in the early 1900’s with mostly original everything, including the sliding no screen having windows.  We typically only crack the windows or put in temporary screens when fully open due to not wanting the cat to get out.  Further, while sleeping I’m typically in the buff unless we have visitors over - story time!\\n\\nTalk about an amazing weekend... the northwest weather has been treating us well lately.  Saturday we went golfing, rode bikes to go eat and play some pinball, then basically enjoyed each other’s presence for the remainder of the day.  Sunday morning was starting off no different.  Looking forward to a quick walk and talk over some caffeine then commencing with our normal Costco run and likely some yard work, etc.\\n\\nTime to get up!  After handling some normal morning routines I head to the bedroom while LL finishes her routine in the bathroom.  I try to respect the neighbors by putting on some clothes while walking around downstairs with the blinds open.  The first thing I see are my Adidas basketball shorts from the early years (these things are over 15 years old and still going strong - love em!).  I pick them up, put them on, then hop on the bed and decide to take a tour of reddit.... Here we go.....\\n\\nNot 10 seconds later I feel that initial sensation you get when an itch creeps up, but on the base of the head of my dick.  (This all feels like slow motion)  I reach down to itch it and from the time I start moving my hand to the time I reached my dick the feeling went from itch to fire..  so instead of itching I pulled my dick out to observe for any visual signs of concern.  I didn’t really see anything... THE PAIN IS INCREASING!!\\n\\nAt this point I throw my shorts off and as soon they hit the ground I hear “BZZZZZZZZZZZZZBBZBZZ”.   \\n\\nMe: “BABE!!!!”  \\n\\nLL runs in asking what’s wrong. \\n\\nMe:  “I think a bee or wasp stung my dick!”\\n\\nLL:  “WTH do you mean a bee or wasp stung your dick!?!”\\n\\nI pointed at the buzzing shorts.  After regaining a bit of my composure I hammer fisted the shorts and confirmed that yes, yes in-fact a wasp was in my shorts and stung my dick.  \\n\\nLet me say one thing, I consider myself a fairly intelligent person but LL out does me here and in many other areas.. it’s one of the main reasons I adore this lady.  Either way, aside from being a smarty pants LL doesn’t handle high stress situations very well.  At this point my eyes are bugged out and she can tell I’m a bit concerned about my dick.  She grabs her phone and googles “wasp sting dick”.  Really.... anyways, she ends up finding stories about other people’s dick’s getting stung and is laughing... she’s lost god damn site of the mission.  \\n\\nMe:  “Babe.... maybe just look up wasp sting treatment”\\n\\nLL:  “ohhhhhh yeahhhhhhh - sorry”\\n\\nWasp Treatment - Clean with soap, treat with vinegar for 15 min, and then ice.\\n\\nCleaning with soap - check!  LL brings me a glass of white wine vinegar....\\n\\nLL: “to soak your dick....”\\n\\nI have to walk into the office and close the door because I’m so damn embarrassed that I’m soaking my dick in a good drinking cup full of vinegar.  15 minutes pass and I go shower.  Pain is all but gone and there is no swelling.\\n\\nAs I sit here typing this up I can still smell the vinegar on my finger and can only imagine how bad my dick smells.  This little bastard isn’t going to ruin my day; I have his corpse in a sandwich baggy and he will be going with us to Costco and our other adventures.  This is just in case my dick swells to the size of a grapefruit or something.  \\n\\nWell, thanks for listening and don’t forget to check your shorts!\\n\\nTL;DR - Put my shorts on without checking and got my dick stung by a wasp. Buckle up mofus as this story may be the most pathetic story you are going to read today.\\n\\nSkip the first Paragraph if you wanna avoid my sob story lol.\\n\\nSome  backstory. I\\'m a 20 y/o (guess not anymore) virgin from a country where  prostitution is legal and the other day I decided to off myself. It  didn\\'t really have a reason, I just felt like it. I started googling the  best ways to end yourself and weirdly enough, google provided  sufficient information on the first page on a Wikipedia article. While I  stood there with a bottle of Bleach, I just couldn\\'t help but feel like  it would probably not taste well enough and scrapped that Idea, and  thought to myself:\" Why die like that, I have not tried everything to be  happy yet. Do it like this one american that decided to not end himself  and live a life of strippers and blackjack.\" So here we go. After much  consideration I\\'ve dug up a number of a prostitue nearby and gave her a  call. 70€ for 30 minutes, while that made me physically repell, I  thought to myself: \"Dude, you are literally about to off yourself and  this is where you draw the line?\".\\n\\nA  day later I went to her, while she didn\\'t look like on the photo she  was still not bad looking. A 29 year old Brazilian Milf with some big  ol\\' BADONKAHONKAHONKAS, like some genourmous Bahoonkadoonkahonkas\\n\\nI  decided to tell her to start it with a blowjob. followed up by some 69.  I dont wanna write some weird ass fanfiction here but it\\'s sorta  relevant to the story.  Here comes the cut tough... as it turned out,  due to my medication it may be possible that one of the Sideeffects was  Erectile Dysfunction. (very epic) .While she was trying her best to jerk  my wingawongwong to the point that my unborn children leak to the  blanket she found herself to be trying longer than usual. Let\\'s put it  like that. My dick was Nestle and she was an unfortunate African  Resident. After some more Stroking and Fake Moaning she started to  question me what the hell I was doing and told me to concentrate. Guess  she was getting bored and started to ask me if I lived alone. I answered  her that I\\'ve already moved out and answered to a follow up question  that my parents were split up and I\\'ve been taking Medication for my  mental Illness which may have had the side effect that it was a real  challenge to cum for me.\\n\\nShe  was visibly feeling bad for me and has been reminding me multiple times  that my booked time was almost up. I was still laying there with a  smile to my face. I expected this to happen and just had to laugh at  this divine cruelty.  It also wasn\\'t the first time something like this  happened. Thinking back 2 years when I\\'ve been receiving a blowjob by a  transwoman that also happened. I thought to myself that she just wasnt  very good at it. The worst part of the whole thing was when I was  getting her from behind and couldn\\'t find the hole at first. But common  guys, real talk here, It\\'s hard to hit on the first try. Overall, not  the worst sexual experience i\\'ve had. Just... don\\'t look trough my  Posthistory.\\n\\nBut  there was also something valuable to be learned. I\\'ve tried to change  something, I may have failed, like.. pathetically failed. But I still  tried. And I will keep trying to change something. Maybe not a prostitue  again but I will keep trying. It was a sad attempt but it isn\\'t  anywhere near as sad as completely giving up. It took me a lot of  currage to do this thing, and I will take this courage to the next  challenging life situation. Also I can now tell others about my mistake,  so they don\\'t have to make the same mistake. Don\\'t think you aren\\'t  good enough because you didn\\'t  have some trivial thing as sex. Also,  don\\'t give up. Keep trying, make mistakes and learn from them.\\n\\nTL;DR  Hired a prostitute, turned out I had erectyle disfunction and we both  faked pleasure. Couldn\\'t come and disappointed the prostitute and made  her feel bad for my Lifesituation but still learned a valuable life  lesson I may not have learned if I didn\\'t try to change something.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nEdit: Honestly, this post has inspired me to try something new so I will be making a Video about it with general intend of trying out new things in life. [So I will be updating you guys on here soon.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyluL4zHZqhSkxpZHZetnVw/?guided_help_flow=5) This will hopefully motivate me to try out new things.  Today I was sitting at a local redlight I know all too well when BAM! What do I see? A poor, unsuspecting grasshopper staring back at me from the other side of the glass. I shoot him a quick flick clicking the windshield in the process but it only ends in a throbbing fingernail. Grasshopper unphased.\\n\\nTime for plan B. As the light turns green, I survey the surroundings and giddily determine that the coast is clear, passionately pushing the pedal plum into the floorboard, revving my V4 for all she’s worth, VROOOM! 10mph...15mph....my new buddy isn’t budging. As several more seconds pass and 20 turns into 25..30..35..40! Oh Crap. Blue lights. I stoically pull over, glaring at the grasshopper one last time while awaiting my fate. He smirks back with those squinty little eyes.\\n\\nUh, yes sir, I do know it’s a 25 MPH school zone. Why was I speeding? Well, tbh I was seeing how fast I could go before that grasshopper would slide off. Cop follows my gaze to the grasshopper... Looks back at me. Back at the smirking grasshopper. 4 seconds of suspenseful anticipation pass and as I’m frantically trying to come up with a better excuse, the officer interrupts my thoughts by dying with laughter. I nervously chuckle back and gratefully press onward with my business.\\n\\nTL;DR Got pulled over because a grasshopper made me do it. Wouldn’t leave no matter how fast I went  Finally, I get to post one of these! And bonus, it happened today! This is pretty much the only bright side to the whole thing, sadly.\\n\\nBecause I am human, I enjoy money, and I decided quite a while ago that I wanted more of it, so I started applying for other jobs. Also, because I live in the 21st century, and you can\\'t just wander into a building and instantly become the manager anymore, I\\'ve been doing all of these applications online. So, being the good little applicant that I am, I made sure my CV was perfect and up-to-date, and made sure to write a personalised cover letter for every single job I applied for. I thought I was doing a pretty good job, except for the fact that over the past few months, I haven\\'t even been getting any rejections any more, much less positive replies or interviews.\\n\\nThis continued on for several months, and all the while, my self-esteem started to plummet. A whole bunch of idiots from my high school have decent jobs! I see them on Facebook! How come I can\\'t get one? Last week, trying to be a little less direct in my approach, I decided to email a whole bunch of recruitment agencies too...and even they didn\\'t reply. What? I could be making you money, guys! Don\\'t just ignore me! What are you, every girl I ever knew until age 17?\\n\\nThe fact that they didn\\'t reply stirred up my curiosity. My CV is saved as a Word document, but I use an alternative program. Maybe the formatting is getting messed up and making me look unprofessional, and I can\\'t see it on my PC? So, I decided to email my girlfriend to test it...using the Windows 10 Mail app. As I have been since probably last July.\\n\\nI sent her an email with the CV attached, and the subject \"Test\". [This is what she received.](http://i.imgur.com/0VgvAdy.jpg) No attachments or anything. I then decided to try using the browser version of Gmail, which I haven\\'t done in a long time. It worked perfectly.\\n\\n7 fucking months, Microsoft. 7 Goddamn shitty fucking months since I\\'ve had a job interview. Eat a fucking bouquet of dicks.\\n\\n**TL;DR: Microsoft broke all my fucking job applications for the better part of a year and I had no idea.**\\n\\nEdit: Not suing Microsoft, guys. First, this is almost certainly my fault (I AM on TIFU, not techsupport). Second, I am English. We don\\'t sue. We complain in the pettiest medium available to us.  This happened an hour ago, also I\\'m on mobile so sorry if I make any typos.\\n\\nSo for backstory, I have a sore throat, and I made tea with some oregano leaves we have in our garden. When the tea was done, I took some, and in the process, put some leaves in the mug. I thought \"Eh, leave it in, you can eat it anyways so what\\'s the worse that could happen?\". I also put turmeric powder in the tea coz why not?\\n\\nAs I was drinking the tea, I felt some kind of particle going down my throat. I thought nothing of it, only that maybe I put a bit too much turmeric powder and some of it wasn\\'t mixed(which was a dumb idea coz the tea was hot and in order to have powder leftover that wasn\\'t mixed, I needed to put a LOT of powder). \\n\\nAs I was finishing the tea, I noticed something black at the bottom of the cup. It was covered by one of the leaves so I took it and what I saw was one of those hairy caterpillars just sitting there, most likely boiled to death(might be pushing Rule 4s\\' \"No deaths of animals\"). It was most likely from the leaf I had neglected to remove coz \"whAt\\'S The worSt ThaT cOulD hApPeN??\". I just finished the tea, mind you. Then, the realization set in. The \"particles\" weren\\'t particles at all, they were caterpillar hair, and I drank the whole mug. I couldn\\'t spit the tea out, for obvious reasons. So I just had to sit here, confused and disgusted out of my head, and decided to write this. \\n\\nTL;DR: I drank a whole mug of oregano tea, then realized that it had a whole hairy caterpillar in the same mug and I drank some of its hairs.\\n\\nEdit: Many people have been asking about oregano tea. We have Cuban oregano in our household, not the small-leaved ones. Cuban oregano has wider leaves and fibers all around it. As for the benefits, there isn\\'t really proven evidence of it being good for you, it\\'s more of a family traditional cure for throat problems, but i think that\\'s because its warm and it soothes your throat. Also i removed the \"4 karma\" part as many ppl have said it was cringy and annoying, sorry abt that.\\n\\nEDIT2: I\\'ve washed the leaves before boiling them, so I don\\'t really know how they got there Today I fucked up. There\\'s a girl in my Ecology class. Let\\'s call her \"Madge\". Madge is your go-getting try-hard holier-than-thou know-it-all with an unchanging facial expression I can only describe as \"cat trying to shit a peach pit\". One of those constant-frowners, and constant-downers. \\n\\nI even tried to get along with Madge at the start; I\\'d sit by her and try to engage her (read: humor her) with conversations in relevant topics about Ecology, such as the thrilling handedness of apes or edge-of-your-seat songbird plumage complexity, but just trying to be civil was a futile endeavour. Expecting Madge to be civil with you because you were civil with her is like expecting the lion not to eat you because you didn\\'t eat it. Madge was born to be an asshole.\\n\\nEverything you said to her was met with a \"Pffft\", or a dramatic roll of the eyes, and a quick retort such as \"Well, if you\\'d actually *read* Carter et al. 2007, you would have known that...\" She had to be better and smarter than everyone, at everything, all the time. And boy, that shit got real old, real quick. So I stopped sitting by her. And began to loathe her. With a pre-occupied disposition. I thought about her twice today before even writing this, that\\'s how much I don\\'t like her.\\n\\nFast forward to the first Capture the Flag game of the year. Being a Freshman, I thought I\\'d attend as a way to get out of my residence room and meet some people. The first game was at about 8:00PM, the campus was already dark, and I showed up just wearing shorts and a T-shirt. Out of 150+ people (who knew Capture the Flag was so popular?) I ended up being possibly the most under-dressed person there. Camouflage, Ghillie suits, face-paint, and black morph costumes were just some of the norm. This was like Capture the Flag Olympics. \\n\\nTeams were divided into short sleeve vs. long sleeve, and the \"flags\" were two bicycle lights. I began to mingle with fellow short-sleeves... and that\\'s when I saw her. Madge. Black boots, black pants, black turtleneck, black scarf, black cap, black gloves. She was going all Call of Duty for this game -- of course. Why wouldn\\'t she be a try-hard at Capture the Flag too? And I just knew I\\'d have to tag her the fuck out. This was my chance to prove I was better at something.\\n\\nThe first few rounds, us short-sleeves did terribly because no one stayed behind to defend, so we lost 3 rounds promptly. Each time they blew the whistle, I could hear Madge laughing. I could hear it. So I switched to defense. To prevent \"camping\", there was a 50 meter buffer around each \"flag\". Conveniently for me, there was a group of hedges 50 meters away from my flag. So I hid in the hedges.\\n\\nEach time anyone from the other team tried to sneak up to our flag, I\\'d jump out of the hedges, startle the hell out of them, and that would give me the time I needed to run up and tag them out. I\\'d probably tagged out 8-10 people in about 15 minutes, when the stars aligned, and I saw her. Madge. Walking through the shadows along the side of a building, headed straight for our flag, thinking she was so sneaky with all her matching black gear. This was it. It was *my time to shine*.\\n\\nBut I was too excitable. I bounded from the hedges like Sea Biscuit while she was still a good 40-50 feet away. So I yelled \"AAAaarrgh!\" to try to emphasize the startling effect. She shrieked in surprise, but without missing a beat, she spun around 180 degrees and headed back for her \"side\" at a dead sprint. I then realized that if she got to her side before I caught her, she\\'d be \"out of play\" and I couldn\\'t tag her out -- that was an impossible embarrassment, I couldn\\'t allow it. I took off too, at a dead sprint. Like Gimli, I\\'m not so much for long runs, but dangerous across short distances. I was gaining on her, and now confidently puffed up, with a laugh I shouted \"YOU CAN RUN IF YOU WANT, I\\'LL JUST CATCH YOU WHEN YOU\\'RE TIRED!\"\\n\\nThe chase lasted probably 100-150 feet before she tripped on a tree root and fell pretty hard, but made no attempt to get back up. As I got closer, I realized she had stooped to a whole new low - playing the crying game, surely exaggerating an injury that would thus make my \"tagging\" of her distasteful. But then as I got closer still, I realized she was *really* crying, like *hysterically* crying. I was still mad, so as I got up to her I said \"Crying won\\'t fucking help\", at which point she rolled on to her back and looked up at me and shouted \"GET THE FUCK AWAY!\". I leaned down to make eye contact and said \"it\\'s just a fucking game\", to which she cocked an eyebrow and said \"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!\"\\n\\nAnd then it hit me.\\n\\nI did not recognize this girl.\\n\\n*This was not Madge.*\\n\\nThis was some girl walking to the bus station after a night class.\\n\\nHorrified, mouth hanging open, the rolodex of my mind spun as I suddenly imagined what it must have been like from her perspective: a large, strange, bearded, sweaty, under-dressed man jumped out of the bushes screaming \"AAARRRRrrrgh!\", and when she ran, he ran too, screaming \"YOU CAN RUN IF YOU WANT, I\\'LL JUST CATCH YOU WHEN YOU\\'RE TIRED\", and when he saw her crying, said \"Crying won\\'t fucking help\".\\n\\nI wanted to apologize, I wanted to introduce myself, I wanted to explain, but all I could get out was \"Hey... sorry -- it was, it\\'s just... Hi, I\\'m... Hey, you know, Capture the Flag?... PLEASE DON\\'T CALL THE POLICE, THIS WAS ALL A MISUNDERSTANDING\" and then I ran away hoping she hadn\\'t seen enough of my face to create a composite sketch for Campus Security.\\n\\nI never ended up tagging her, or Madge for that matter, and I never went back to Capture the Flag after that (I hear it may be getting cancelled) but I probably caused some seriously deep-seated anxieties about night classes that will haunt that poor girl forever.\\n\\nDear night class girl, if you\\'re a Redditor, I am so sorry. I\\'m actually a pretty nice guy, really.\\n\\nTL;DR - Today I fucked up by wanting to get back at a snooty know-it-all from Ecology class by chasing her down at a night game of Capture The Flag only to realize I\\'d chased down (and probably subsequently scarred) some girl from night class who wasn\\'t even playing.\\n\\n**EDIT:** Wow, thanks for the Reddit gold, guys - I\\'d say \"you surprised me and popped my gold cherry\" but that expression would seem to be in poor taste after my story. \\n\\n**EDIT:** I never realized how much I made it sound like she broke her neck at first. Holy shit. Also, I laughed my ass off at how many people say there\\'s sexual tension between me and Madge. Fucking Madge.      ... But maybe there is tension. Maybe I am in love with her... holy shit MY WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN A LIE! Jk lol I really still hate her.  Obligatory, not today. However, enough time has passed and with anonymity, I should be able to tell this and remain unharmed. \\n\\nAround 12yrs ago, I’d stopped in my local for a pint or two, to drown my sorrows.  It was a great little place, typically frequented by the local Uni students. Great music, good *views* and cheap beers. What more could a single man ask for?\\n\\nHalf way through Guiness no2 I lock eyes with a lass across the way from me. She’s there with another guy (turns out to be a work colleague) and she gives me a beautiful smile.  \\nSmile back, shyness kicks in and I find myself very invested in finding the bottom of my glass. I’m not the sort of outgoing guy who excels in these situations. \\n\\nAbout 20mins later, Colleague leaves and “Alice” comes over to me.  This has never happened before, so I’m in a mixed state of smug and shock. But, play it cool (try to).  Somehow my clueless, shy-guy gambit really comes through and after a few hours we end up on a train back to Alice’s house. \\n\\nAfter a quick train ride, which seemed to take absolutely forever, as Alice made her future intentions very clear, Big head was fully disengaged. Little head is doing all of the thinking right now, so I’m not paying much attention to my surroundings at his point. I’m more interested in the goings-on, obviously. \\n\\nThe next morning when I’m slightly more alert, I can’t help but notice photo’s of a man around the house. Wedding photos, holiday photos, and one that really stands out as the guy is in Camouflage, with a somewhat sandy background.  Notice the big gun and the chest rig...this isnt a holiday snap. Fuck. \\n\\n“Alice, who the hell is this?”  \\n“That’s John, he’s.....not around these days”\\n\\nI try to press a little more, but Alice clearly doesnt want to talk about it. She just keeps insisting he’s “not around”. Ok, either separated or dead.  Alice doesnt want to talk about it, I’m not going to press the issue.  No wedding ring or anything, so I guess I’m OK here. \\n\\nWe keep seeing each-other for 4months and things are fucking great. I feel like the luckiest guy in the world.  Finally things are going my way!  Until Alice drops the bombshell. John is coming back soon. \\n\\nWait, what? What do you mean coming back?\\n\\n“He’s been in Afghanistan with the (Royal) Marines, but his rotation is nearly done”\\n\\nPanic mode engaged. I’ve spend the last 4months sleeping with a Marines wife.  Alice tries to ensure me that John is “perfectly fine with these arrangements” and isn’t going to care that I was planning a future with his wife. \\n\\nQuickly out the door, saying my Goodbye and “don’t fucking tell him”.  I’m going back to my single bedroom apartment - on my own - to hide under the bed for the next 12-18months. Fuck. \\n\\nI found myself moving out of the area after 2months, fortunately I never saw Alice or John, so my head remains firmly attached to my shoulders. \\n\\nTLDR: Got into a relationship and found out 4months later She was married to a Royal Marine, who was serving in Afghan. So I have a neurological disability among other health issues.\\nI use a wheelchair, My legs are a pretty useless most of the time.\\nI had an MRI scan appointment for my head; neck and spine.\\nAll is going to plan, the nurses tell me they will play some music for me as it’s a pretty long scan (20ish minutes). \\nDespite having had many scans they still scare me, mainly due to the cage that goes over your face which makes you feel like you’re being locked into some kind of medieval torture device and the insanely loud horrifying noises (this is coming from someone who has moderate to severe hearing impairment!)\\nSo I’m in there for about 10 minutes, already shaking and generally having an unpleasant time.\\nThey stop to ask if I’m okay between the scans while some top 40 type music plays (I think I’ll take some SOAD with me next time).\\nAnyway the guy asks me multiple times over headphones if I’m sure I’m okay, he’s clearly not buying my bs!\\nI lie through my teeth and he continues to the next scan, a new song starts and I hear “When your legs don’t work like they used to before..” - Ed Sheeran \\nI immediately start laughing my ass off, the scan stops abruptly.\\nThe Technologists voice comes back “Are you sure you’re okay?!”\\nPretty sure he thought my laughing was hysterical crying or a seizure, oooopsie XD\\n\\nAnyway I thought I’d share a bit of my dark humour!\\nAlso we got the scan finished after I composed myself.\\nWe all had a good laugh!\\n\\nTLDR\\nI made a medical professional panic and stop my MRI scan because he thought I was hysterically crying or having a seizure.\\nIn reality I was laughing at Ed Sheeran pointing out my being a cripple. (Actually two weekends ago.)\\n\\nSo I was in NYC for the US Open and this hospital had a booth handing out free small bottles of sunscreen! Great, because as a man without a purse I think most of the sizes in the store are annoying to carry. Also, it came with a little belt loop metal ring thing, so I could just attach it to my pants and look super cool.\\n\\nCouple days later I\\'m at Disneyland with my sunscreen attached. When I got onto the Thunder Mountain ride, I didn\\'t realize the sunscreen bottle was being squeezed between my leg and the safety bar until after it was over and it basically looked like I enjoyed the ride way too much. All over my crotch and the seat.\\n\\nI didn\\'t have the integrity to make eye contact with any of the employees or check if the people behind me got into the ride. I just booked it out of there and even after washing off my shorts I had a massive grease stain on my crotch all day.\\n\\nFootage from immediately after: [https://imgur.com/a/Itz0MAh](https://imgur.com/a/Itz0MAh)\\n\\nTL;DR: check the image So today in my bio class I was taking screenshots of the slides, and my teacher changed the slide too fast for me to take a picture, so I made a small distress noise. Little did I know that I had forgot to mute after my last question, and everyone in the class heard it. But my bio teacher thought it was A CAT, and immediately said, \"Is that a cat? Who brought their cat? Show your petS!!!!!!\" And then I just DIED of laughter, because that sound was ME, and it all came from because I forgot to mute my mic, because trust me, I would NOT have made that noise if I knew I was unmuted.\\n\\nIf that wasn\\'t worst enough, I then went onto a discord server, and told everyone about what happened. To add to the story effect, I then tried to record the exact sound I made.... which meant I was trying out different \"meows.\" BUT I STILL WASN\\'T MUTED IN THE GOOGLE MEET! So everyone heard me meowing for two straight minutes. What makes THAT even worse is that I only knew I wasn\\'t muted when I checked the group chat I had with my bio class, with my classmates asking me if I was ok, and that\\'s when I realized I forgot to mute A SECOND TIME.\\n\\nI honestly don\\'t think I can live this one down.... I may or may not have to switch schools lol\\n\\nTL;DR: I meowed for 2 straight minutes unmuted in my google meet\\n\\n&#x200B; So this is less of a TIFU and more of an I fucked up my whole life. \\n\\nGrowing up my family was pretty poor. My mom was a single mom and always did her best to try to make ends meet, but it’s tough. We lived in a small apartment and didn’t have much. We rationed a lot of what we ate or used. This included soap! \\n\\nMy mom always bought the cheap “3 in 1” soap bottles that have shampoo, conditioner, and body soap in one. We had to limit how much we used, so she always just washed my hair with it and told me the soap would run down the rest of my body. I learned this growing up, and continued it into my teen years when I would shower myself. I only ever washed my hair, and let the soapy water flow down the rest of my body.\\n\\nI am now 27 years old with my own place and doing much better (and my mom is too!). But I never really thought about this way of showering since it’s literally the one way I’ve ever known. So even with making more money, I still only washed my hair and let the soapy water run down. \\n\\nI only realized I’ve been doing this all wrong when I came across a post that talked about whether or not people wash their feet with soap in the shower. Then someone mentioned you wash everything else with soap why wouldn’t you wash your feet. I was so confused and realized I’ve been a dirty person as long as I’ve been alive. \\n\\nOff to the store to go buy some real soap.\\n\\nTL;DR - Grew up so poor we couldn’t use soap. It affected my hygiene habits and I never realized it was wrong until 27 years later. This indeed not happened today, but just had a friend reunion where we touched this awkward story so I thought I would share. I have been a fellow TIFU reader for a few years now, but obligatory new account to share my story.\\n\\n8 years ago I (European male in his early 20s that time) was an exchange student in China in a small, provincial city - still over a million inhabitants, where foreigners were a rare sight that time. I went there with fundamental Mandarin knowledge and I was super focused on getting a better language proficiency. I thought the best idea to achieve this - apart from attending classes - was to get some local friends and hang out together and talk constantly. WeChat - the same WeChat Trump is now banning in the US - was just introduced that time, and it was getting super popular with the smartphone user netizens. It was not a dating app per se, but obviously many people used it to get to know girls/guys and of course the app helped to have casual hookups as well.\\n\\nOne day a Chinese woman added me as a contact via WeChat\\'s Nearby People function, she looked quite gorgeous on the picture (which does not mean anything because of the beautifying apps in place in Asia), we started to chat, and she was quite interested in me. During the numerous hours of chatting I learned from her that she was 43, got divorced a few years before, had a kid who was attending school, and she is working in finance. She was also quite open-minded and flirty, and brought up erotic topics. Fast forward two weeks, I asked her whether she would like to meet in person, which she agreed to, looked good in person as well, and after a quick dinner she invited me to one of her apartments. We did what adults do, liked the experience so we agreed that it can continue, so we made it a regular thing. We also agreed that this whole was purely based on carnal pleasures, no emotions, she also mentioned that she knew it would not last forever and I would probably want a girl my age to be my girlfriend and she was super OK with it.\\n\\nFast forward a couple of months, I met a girl at a university different than I attend, who was super cute, gorgeous and we were pretty much on the same waves, which is very rare between two persons growing up in different cultures. We started to date, became a couple, so after a few weeks I felt it would be the best to tell the situation to Miss-43-year-old hottie and not to double cross anyone in this situation. She was sad, but understanding, so we did it for one last time and then we sort of broke up. She also said that she hopes I found a good girlfriend.\\n\\nAfter a few weeks, my then-girlfriend said that it would be a good idea to meet her mom. I knew that her parents divorced and his dad living overseas, and she also was on good terms with her mom, she told me several times how cool her mom was on making money on the stock exchange. She also told me that her mom probably knew that my then-girlfriend is going out with a guy but she did not tell anything about me, and her mom did not ask questions. And here comes the FU: I did not connect the dots. Even though now these pieces of info seem to be clear red flags for at least a couple of follow-up questions, but then everything seemed quite general high-level info that I didn\\'t give too much to think about. I didn\\'t even ask my then-gf to show me a picture of her mom, but blindly agreeing to meet her mom .\\n\\nIt was a lunch, and gosh, my life\\'s most awkward and longest lunch, and I couldn\\'t even eat. When my then-gf\\'s mother came to greet me, she was frozen with shock, and so was I, because she was Miss 43-year-old hottie that I slept a couple of times with. After the initial few minutes shock, her mom recovered quicker than me, and tried to save the situation, but none of us were too good actors and it was very obvious that we met before. Her mom tried a weak lie that we met in the supermarket near their apartment but it was not too convincing. I am also not good in faking, so after the seemingly endless lunch we went for a walk, and my then-gf pushed me further how on Earth I met her mom. I spilled the beans and told her what we did with her mom. She was furious, obviously, broke up with me on the sight, sent several messages later what a swine I was and what a slut her mom was, etc, then blocked me so I could not contact her. I also tried to contact Miss-43-year-old hottie on some update, and several days later she told me that they were still not on talking terms with her daughter due to what happened but I shall not worry it would be fine later, but better to cease all contacts between us three, so she deleted my contact as well. I just really hope that the unintentional rift I caused between the two was not too long-term.\\n\\nTl;dr: Met a hot Chinese lady on WeChat and got into an adult relationship with her. Met a cute girl my age and started dating, resulting in breaking up with hot Chinese lady. FU by not doing a background check and on a family lunch it was revealed that they are mother and daughter. FU by spilling the beans to cute girl what I did with her mom and causing a family rift. My husband is at work until late and my son comes home after 5 pm usually. Around 2pm, I was masturbating when I heard the front door open. My son had arrived much earlier than expected, making me jump out of bed, my vibrator went flying. When it landed on the ground there was huge cracking sound, and my son called loudly from downstairs asking if I was alright. I could hear him running toward my room, and that caused me to panic and run toward the door to hold it so that he wouldn\\'t be able to open it and see me naked. But just before I got to the door, my foot stepped on the lubricated vibrator and I slipped and fell hard, making an even bigger thumping sound. My son knocked repeatedly on the door, and yelled, \"Mom, are you okay?\" I was sooooooooo embarrassed! I  told him I was taking a shower and slipped on soap. I told him I will be alright, and lucky for me he went away. I felt so stupid. TL;DR Obligatory this-happened-last-week disclosure.\\n\\nWhen I go to the gym, I put in my earphones and let the music absorb me. It eases the rest of the workout because it all feels like one swift process, and my brain goes on automatic, reflexively doing everything without strong conscious focus from me. That’s usually not an issue, but, well...\\n\\nIt was time for my chest workout and I spotted a pair of benches lined up together, with the heads right against one another. One of them was free, and the other was occupied by a dude. Now, this man was something. He looked like he was the sole Supreme Warrior of all the lands of Pakistan. Biceps and triceps bulging so much they look like they aboutta spill onto the ground and start lifting weights themselves. Likely eats the equivalent of a Hindu Holy Cow in his daily protein shakes.\\n\\nFully absorbed by Sia’s chanting in my ears, I walk over. Routinely, I remove the clamps and weights of the previous user on my bar and start searching for some 5kg weights. I take a few steps around, eyes scanning the floor and many racks for them, and my eyes finally set on a nice, jungle-green pair sitting on a rack. Dutifully, I start removing the clamp on the rack as to reach the 5kg weight, with only a small, nagging voice in the back of my head wondering, *“why is there a clamp on this rack?”* and began to pull out the weight.\\n\\nAnd then, it happened.\\n\\nThe enchanting harmony of Sia’s voice was penetrated by a booming, **HEY!**\\n\\nMy hands freeze, and my neck cranes upwards to see Commander Pakistan himself lying down on his bench, looking ready to start his bench press with his hands gripping the bar above him, which just so happened to line up perfectly with the rack I was dealing wi— Oh. That’s when it dawned on me. The “rack” I was pulling weights off was, in fact, the bar he was using, and I was about to casually give this guy a serious injury had he lifted the bar, ignorant to my oblivious meddling.\\n\\nI ripped out my earphones, threw my hands back, and immediately started to apologize. Initially, I saw only trickles of smoke toot out the ears of our South Asian Demi-god—indicating he was only slightly pissed; later he seemed to find it funny, even cordially giving me tips for my workout. Very chill guy.\\n\\nBut damn, boys and girls. My automatism could’ve SERIOUSLY injured someone, and boy did I FU.\\n\\nTL;DR: I obliviously removed the weights off the bar of Zeus’ bastard Pakistani warrior son while he was using it and I could’ve injured him I bought a new razer kraken headset about 6-7 months ago, and at the time I didn\\'t realise that there was a volume wheel. So I started to use it when I realised that it felt so quiet, so I unplugged them and put my shitty sony headphones back in. \\n\\nA couple of days later I plugged the headphones back in, to see if anything had changed, nothing. So I searched it up on the razer forums, there were fixes but nothing worked. So I tried to use it in game when I bent over to get a can of coke of the ground, when I accidentally turned up the volume wheel, not knowing I had done this, I thought it was awesome. But about an hour later, somehow I accidentally turned it back down, and I thought it had broken itself again.\\n\\nSkip ahead six months or so, and I plug them in again because why not, and I realise there\\'s a volume wheel. I turn it up, working. Good as new. And I spent the rest of the day feeling like the biggest idiot.\\n\\nTL;DR Bought a new headset, didn\\'t realise there was a volume wheel. Thought the headset was broken because the volume wheel was turned all the way down. Six months later, I realise the problem and feel like an idiot. \\n\\n Edit: omg thanks for all the internet points.\\n My hands are still shaking, but I have to tell someone the horrors I just experienced\\n\\nI’m a fairly active guy, and I’ve got a few of those sleeveless shirts I wear for working out. But with lockdown and a few life events, it’s been about 1, 2 months since I’ve had a strict workout schedule. These sleeveless shirts have been hanging together in the back of my closet since then, just chillin. \\n\\nFor context, I live in a basement bedroom, and my closet is the room closest to the outside. I suppose I should have seen this coming, but I was blissfully ignorant. \\n\\nI went to dust off my workout shirts about ten minutes ago.  Get some early morning work in since I couldn’t go back to sleep and felt motivated. I was feeling pumped, had some sick music playing in my headphones, and was super proud of myself for getting going again. \\n\\nThis was where the fuckup happened. \\n\\nI peeled back the other clothes in my closet, and grabbed the farthest shirt at the back of my closet. Don’t ask my why, I’m going to regret it for the rest of my life. The shirt came off the hanger, fell loosely on top of my hand, and resting right on the back (and now the top of my arm) was the biggest, hairiest, most legged centipede I’ve ever seen or imagined. I live in a rural area, so I’ve seen my fair share of bugs, but this fucker was COLOSSAL. Half of my hand big. \\n\\nAnd that’s not the end of it. Like Usain Bolt on cocaine, the giant fucker DASHED up my arm. As soon as it touched bare skin, I lost my absolute shit, spasming and letting out a piercing scream that woke up all dogs within a 3 mile radius. \\n\\nFlailing my arm around caused me to absolutely bitchslap my bottle of cologne sitting on the shelf immediately to my right, which promptly launched across the room and exploded into a billion little glass shards on the tile floor. The centipede, knocked onto my floor, scurried away as fast as his million legs could carry him while I freaked the fuck out. \\n\\nSo now I’m sitting on the couch in the next room, shaking, afraid to ever walk barefoot on my floor again since Big Bongo is still on the loose, and wondering how the fuck I’m ever going to get my room to stop smelling like the boys locker room at high school had an opossum wander in and die after eating 15 axe spray bottles. \\n\\nTLDR; Battled the mother of all centipedes in my closet. Centipede won.\\n\\nEdit: Thanks for the awards and all the comments! A lot of you have told me about how centipedes eat things like silverfish, which means I could have a much worse problem than I originally thought. Thanks for the additional nightmare fuel, Reddit. I’ll be burning my house down now\\n\\nEdit: I changed ketamine to Cocaine because that’s r/nothowdrugswork. I was thinking of the yoda meme with how he flipped the fuck out, but it makes more sense in hindsight Right so ordinary day as our towns mall is opening up again I went in to pick up some things for my mother. It was going well until I decided to step onto the elevator to go down....\\n\\nInside the elevator there was a kid with his mom (he had an avengers backpack) an elderly couple , me and a few other people. As a joke to make the kid happy I thought I quote this from Captain America Winter Solider:  \\n\\n“Before we get started, does anyone wanna get out” \\n\\nThe kid instantly turned around and smiled at me and I really hope I made his day there. I thought that was the end of it until I reached the bottom.\\n\\nSo as I got out the elevator I stopped a couple of metres away from it to answer a call from my mom, during this I noticed the elderly couple talking to mall security, then they suddenly turned and pointed/looked in my direction which got me worried. \\n\\n(Sidenote my ethnic origin is Middle Eastern which probably made the situation 10x worse).\\n\\nMall security came over to me and searched me and my bag for “prohibited items” because apparently the elderly couple I talked about basically made it sound I was gonna do something radical or extreme (as in they thought I quoted CA as a last warning before I do something dangerous)\\n\\nThankfully though after security saw that I had nothing on me and nothing dangerous in my bag i walked away free with some very angry elderly couple glaring at me.\\n\\n\\nTLDR: I quoted Captain America’s famous elevator quote to impress a kid and ended up scaring an elderly couple into bringing security over under the impression that I was going to do something extreme or dangerous or life threatening to others.\\n\\nEDIT 1: so a lot of people are questioning whether the security guys had any authority to search me , and truth be told idk. Me as a person I’m not very confrontational or threatening guy and a little bit socially awkward so I didn’t really want to cause a scene. Also it’s not like the security guys came over screaming their heads of at me , it was a gentle approach answered by a gentle response from me (apologies if I blown that part out of proportion) \\n\\nEdit 2: thanks for the awards kind strangers !! So bonus points because this actually happened today but the story starts about a week and a half ago. \\n\\nDay one: I am lactose Intolerant, and I had a stomach ache, no big deal I probably ate something I shouldn\\'t have. No harm done.\\n\\nDay 4: stomach ache is still there. I\\'m a medical professional, I realized that my abdomen on my right lower side was what hurt. Wrote it off as having too much ice cream.\\n\\nDay 6: I thought to myself it could be appendicitis, but I shrugged it off because appendicitis is supposed to be super painful right? This was like 4/10. \\n\\nDay 7:  I realized I had a lump near my anus, I thought huh that\\'s not good, probably just a hemorrhoid, I\\'ve had a few before no biggie.\\n\\nDay 9: this hemorrhoid is the most  painful one I\\'ve ever had, 6/10 I\\'ll pick up some cream and Advil long lasting relief capsules from Target should be able to push right through.\\n\\n\\nDay 11:  I start my vacation tomorrow and am going out of town, (I work in a hospital for context) well that hemorrhoid is really starting to hurt at this point, like a 7/10. So I go work thinking okay I can get a doctor to look at the hemorrhoid and give me some ointment or steroids. \\n\\nWell I\\'m not having a vacation now, because I\\'ll be in the hospital for a few days. Apparently my appendix ruptured a week ago and I just figured it was a stomach ache. Turns out that hemorrhoid was actually pain from the appendix ruptured radiating. The doctor told me that if I didn\\'t come to the hospital within the next couple of days I\\'d be dead. \\n\\nTlDR; having a high pain tolerance finally has a downside, didn\\'t realize my appendix blew up until way too late. Ruined my vacation.\\n\\nSorry for format I\\'m on mobile, I\\'m also on Dilaudid and morphine (one then the other) so please go easy on me. Credit to my girlfriend who begged me to go to the hospital before vacation, I was going to hold off till after a 2 week vacation that I would have died on.\\n\\n\\nUpdate: so I had a few people question why I felt Pain by my anus and how was a lumped formed? So I talked to a surgeon who finally spend the time explaining it, when my appendix ruptured it caused everything else to inflame. The lump I was feeling was pus caused by the colon and gravity causes it to go down.\\n\\n\\n\\nUPDATE 2: apparently I have Crohn\\'s disease :/ lots of pain at the moment. I\\'ll update once everything is for sure.'"
